            "text": "The Japanese Clinical Practice Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock 2020 (J-SSCG 2020), a Japanese-specific set of clinical practice guidelines for sepsis and septic shock created as revised from J-SSCG 2016 jointly by the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine, was first released in September 2020 and published in February 2021. An English-language version of these guidelines was created based on the contents of the original Japanese-language version. The purpose of this guideline is to assist medical staff in making appropriate decisions to improve the prognosis of patients undergoing treatment for sepsis and septic shock. We aimed to provide high-quality guidelines that are easy to use and understand for specialists, general clinicians, and multidisciplinary medical professionals. J-SSCG 2016 took up new subjects that were not present in SSCG 2016 (e.g., ICU-acquired weakness [ICU-AW], post-intensive care syndrome [PICS], and body temperature management). The J-SSCG 2020 covered a total of 22 areas with four additional new areas (patient-and family-centered care, sepsis treatment system, neuro-intensive treatment, and stress ulcers). A total of 118 important clinical issues (clinical questions, CQs) were extracted regardless of the presence or absence of evidence. These CQs also include those that have been given particular focus within Japan. This is a large-scale guideline covering multiple fields; thus, in addition to the 25 committee members, we had the participation and support of a total of 226 members who are professionals (physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, clinical engineers, and pharmacists) and medical workers with a history of sepsis or critical illness. The GRADE method was adopted for making recommendations, and the modified Delphi method was used to determine recommendations by voting from all committee members. As a result, 79 GRADE-based recommendations, 5 Good Practice Statements (GPS), 18 expert consensuses, 27 answers to background questions (BQs), and summaries of definitions and diagnosis of sepsis were created as responses to 118 CQs. We also incorporated visual information for each CQ according to the time course of treatment, and we will also distribute this as an app. The J-SSCG 2020 is expected to be widely used as a useful bedside guideline in the field of sepsis treatment both in Japan and overseas involving multiple disciplines.",

Sepsis is a serious illness that affects all age groups, and the social significance of the creation of a high-quality guideline with the objective of providing medical support for this illness is high. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guideline (SSCG) [1, 2] has been revised as an international sepsis clinical practice guideline every 4 years since 2004. In 2012, the Japanese version of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guideline (J-SSCG), which considered the actual circumstances of Japanese clinical settings, was first published by the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine (JSICM) [3, 4] . At the time of the 2016 revision (J-SSCG 2016), JSICM and the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM) worked together to create a high-quality guideline that is easy to understand even for general clinicians, aiming for widespread dissemination. J-SSCG 2016 actively took up new domains not covered in SSCG 2016, such as imaging diagnosis, body temperature regulation, ICUacquired weakness (ICU-AW), and post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), providing medical guidelines.",

In out-of-hospital, emergency department, or general hospital ward settings, adult patients with suspected infection can be rapidly identified as more likely to have poor outcomes typical of sepsis if they have at least two of the following clinical criteria that together constitute the quick SOFA (qSOFA) score: a respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min or higher, altered consciousness, and a systolic blood pressure of \u2264100 mmHg. The qSOFA criteria can be used to prompt clinicians to further investigate organ dysfunction, initiate or escalate therapy as appropriate, and to consider referral for critical care. Ultimately, an acutely increased SOFA score of 2 or more points confirms the diagnosis of sepsis.

Typical options are shown to make the table practical for use Given their very nature, empiric therapeutic agents are difficult to present as the only absolute option, and they are often presented in various guidelines as evidence and expert opinion suggestions. However, this also depends on the age and region of the antibiograms produced, and the types of antimicrobial agents available at each facility. This table can be used as a reference for experts in the septic/antimicrobial stewardship teams of each facility when developing antimicrobial guidelines for each facility Vertebral osteomyelitis (spondylitis): Refraining from empiric therapeutic drugs is recommended for hemodynamically and neurologically stable spondylitis; however, empiric treatment is indicated when complications of sepsis are present [15] . The regimen of empiric treatment is not established, but options were selected based on the JAID/JSC infectious disease treatment guidelines [5] f Endocarditis: Concomitant use of GM in native valve endocarditis was previously recommended for Staphylococcus aureus [5] , but this is no longer recommended in recent years [16] . A combination regimen of CTRX and ABPC was indicated in place of GM for enterococci. In addition, a regimen without the concomitant use of GM was shown as an empiric treatment [16] . There was also no description in the JAID/JSC infectious disease treatment guideline in cases of endocarditis with a high rate of intracranial dissemination; however, this table presents this considering cerebrospinal fluid penetration. We presented an option for endocarditis of the prosthetic valve that does not include GM as an empiric treatment when the causative organism is uncertain, considering the nephrotoxicity of GM g Mycotic aneurysm: There is no description in the JAID/JSC infectious disease treatment guidelines and no established recommendation exists [5, 17] , but this was presented as an option h Catheter-related bloodstream infections: options were presented based on the JAID/JSC infectious disease treatment guidelines [5] i Meningitis: options were presented based on the JAID/JSC infectious disease treatment guidelines [5, 12] j Unknown or systemic sources: There is no description in the JAID/JSC infectious disease treatment guidelines, but the source of infection is occasionally unknown in sepsis, so options for each possible pathology were presented k Please refer to the description of the TDM guideline 2016 (initial loading dose: 25-30 mg/kg intravenous injection, subsequent maintenance doses (normal renal function):15-20 mg/kg intravenous injection, every 12 h) for the VCM dose [18] CQ4-9: Should procalcitonin be used as an indicator for stopping antimicrobial therapy for sepsis?",

CQ1-2: Diagnosis of sepsis and septic shock Summary: A diagnosis of sepsis is confirmed when the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more acutely increase in the presence of a clear infection or suspected infection. Patients with septic shock can be identified with a clinical construct of sepsis with persisting hypotension requiring vasopressors to maintain mBP \u2265 65 mmHg and having a serum lactate level > 2 mmol/L (18 mg/ dL) despite adequate volume resuscitation. In out-ofhospital, emergency department, or general hospital ward settings, adult patients with suspected infection can be rapidly identified as more likely to have poor outcomes typical of sepsis if they have at least two of the following clinical criteria that together constitute the quick SOFA (qSOFA) score: a respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min or higher, altered consciousness, and a systolic blood pressure of \u2264100 mmHg. The qSOFA criteria can be used to prompt clinicians to further investigate organ dysfunction, initiate or escalate therapy as appropriate, and to consider referral for critical care. Ultimately, an acutely increased SOFA score of 2 or more points confirms the diagnosis of sepsis. Daily routine screening for sepsis is recommended to support the early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis.",

Critically ill patients who have undergone tracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation should have their endotracheal sputum collected and quantitatively cultured; if the bacterial count is found to be over 10 [4] CFU/mL (sputum prior to antibacterial drug administration, sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 77%), then a high possibility of infection with causative bacteria is suspected [39] . Furthermore, a report on the diagnosis of ventilatorassociated pneumonia indicated that the probability of non-isolation of causative bacteria was 94% when bacteria were not isolated from endotracheal sputum [40] . Furthermore, searching for microorganisms in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is also important for deciding the treatment policy for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with pneumonia as either a cause or complication, and this is effective for excluding pneumocystis pneumonia or pulmonary mycosis when the immune system of the patient is weakened [41] .",

A comprehensive literature search was conducted as part of a systematic review, with a focus on the diagnostic accuracy of dividing the extracted articles into \"general ward or emergency rooms (ERs)\" (CQ2-4-1) or \"ICUs\" (CQ2-4-2). A total of 11 articles were included in the category \"general ward or ER\", and the number of papers assessed via a meta-analysis on each biomarker were as follows: CRP, eight articles [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] ; PCT, 11 articles [1] [2] [3] [4] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] ; P-SEP, four articles [51, 52, 54, 55] ; IL-6, four articles [46, 48, 49, 56] . Furthermore, a total of nine articles were included in the category \"ICUs\", and the number of papers assessed via a meta-analysis on each biomarker were as follows: CRP, seven articles [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] ; PCT, nine articles [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] ; P-SEP, four articles [57, 61, 62, 64] ; and IL-6, six articles [58-61, 63, 65] .",

As such, the identification of the source of infection is important not only for surgical drainage, but also for specimen collection to select appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Two epidemiological studies conducted in Japan (2010-2011: 15 facilities; 2016-2017: 59 facilities) indicated that common sources of sepsis were respiratory infections, intra-abdominal infections, urinary tract infections, and soft tissue infections, all of which accounted for approximately 90% of cases [80, 81] Similar trends were observed in multiple international studies [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] . Meanwhile, reports have also indicated that a source of infection was not identified in approximately 1/6th of patients with sepsis [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] . Infectious diseases that should be considered when a specific source of infection could not be identified included diseases in which specific findings are difficult to determine (e.g., infectious endocarditis, catheter-related bloodstream infections) and systemic infections in which a source of infection did not form or was unclear (e.g., fulminant infection following splenectomy, purpura fulminans, rickettsial infection, febrile neutropenia with unknown source, etc.). Caution should be taken in evaluating implantable device-related infections (e.g., catheter-related bloodstream infections, prosthetic valve endocarditis, cerebrospinal fluid shunt-related meningitis/ventriculitis, and prosthetic joint infection) since specific findings are difficult to determine [87] [88] [89] [90] .",

There are two factors: 1) external factors such as history of exposure (including healthcare exposure or travel history), and 2) internal factorsthe patient's own conditions (including age, sex, and underlying diseases). The classification of patient background factors for selecting antimicrobial therapy varies depending on the source of infection. Community-acquired infections generally have causative microorganisms that differ from those of healthcareassociated infections, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa does not need to be routinely covered as a communityacquired pathogen. Exposures, which serve as risk factors for healthcare-associated infections, include invasive procedures or devices (surgery, transplantation, intravascular catheters, urinary catheters, endotracheal tubes, enteral feeding tubes, etc.) and antimicrobial therapy history. For patients with sepsis with a travel history, there is a need to consider systemic infections such as malaria, meningococcal infections, viral hemorrhagic fever, rickettsial diseases, and infections due to drug-resistant bacteria [91, 92] . Sepsis due to rickettsial infection (Japanese spotted fever and scrub typhus) or severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) should be included in the differential diagnosis if the patient has a history of travel to endemic areas of tick-borne infectious diseases in Japan [93] . Furthermore, age is an important patient factor because the causative bacteria in meningitis differ depending on whether the patient is older than 50 years [94]; more than 90% of cases of Legionnaires' disease leading to pneumonia occur in patients older than 50 years [95] . Urinary tract infections and soft tissue infections are common among diabetic patients [96] . Pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) should be considered in neutropenic sepsis [97] . Pneumocystis pneumonia should be included in the differential diagnosis of pneumonia in patients with cellular immunodeficiency, such as human immunodeficiency virus infection [98] .",

Caution with regard to the tissue penetration and in situ activity of the antimicrobial therapy are shown as follows: ceftriaxone, cefepime, and meropenem can be used as \u03b2-lactams in the treatment of meningitis; however, cefazolin should be avoided due to inappropriate cerebrospinal fluid penetration.

Changes in drug therapy need to be implemented rapidly if coverage is deemed insufficient. Targeted antimicrobial therapy should be selected to maximize the treatment effect and minimize adverse effects and collateral damage (i.e., negative influences on indigenous microbiota) [107] . It is beneficial to consider the targeted antimicrobial agents that can be used later when selecting empiric antimicrobial agents. For example, in Japan, cefazolin is the firstline treatment for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia with no intracranial dissemination, and its treatment performance against MSSA bacteremia was superior to that of vancomycin, which is frequently used when the presence of methicillin resistance is not known [108, 109] . With this in mind, the concomitant use of cefazolin should be considered when using vancomycin as an empiric antimicrobial agent with the objective of covering MRSA if the possibility of MSSA is deemed high. In this way, Table 13 (Target therapeutic agents by causative microorganism) shows a list of targeted antimicrobial therapies likely to be encountered in the treatment of sepsis by susceptibility result patterns. When focusing on spectrums in shifting from empirical to targeted antimicrobial therapy, changing from wide-spectrum to narrow-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is referred to as de-escalation, while the opposite is referred to as escalation [1, 3, 110] Refer to CQ4-8 for information on whether deescalation is an effective strategy against sepsis.",

Antibacterial drug selections for polymicrobial infections caused by obligate anaerobic bacteria not only are determined by the susceptibility results of detected anaerobic bacteria but also involves the estimation of mixed infection by multiple anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. Obligate anaerobic bacteria have the three following characteristics depending on the susceptibility rate. (1) Most obligate anaerobic bacteria above the diaphragm (e.g., Peptostreptococcus sp., Prevotella sp.) are susceptibile to \u03b2lactams represented by PCG and CLDM. However, some include \u03b2-lactamase-producing bacteria and CLDM-resistant bacteria (e.g., some Prevotella). (2) Obligate anaerobic bacteria below the diaphragm (e.g., Bacteroides sp.) include \u03b2-lactamase-producing bacteria. The resistance rates of non-fragilis Bacteroides(other than B. fragilis) in particular against CLDM and CMZ have been increasing. (3) Most obligate anaerobic bacteria which include (1) and (2) are susceptibile to SBT/ABPC, TAZ/PIPC, MEPM, and MNZ. Therefore, the two following points should be considered when selecting a target therapeutic drug for polymicrobial infections where obligate anaerobic bacteria contribute: (1) To what extent obligate anaerobic bacteria are covered based on information about whether it is above or below diaphragm or drainage is sufficient, and (2) Empirical treatment (normally MCFG) should be stepped down to oral FLCZ or VRCZ mentioned below if blood culture negativity and clinical stability are confirmed. Complications of endophthalmitis should involve switching to FLCZ or VRCS since MCFG has poor intraocular penetration (L-AMB \u00b1 5-FC if there is resistance to FLCZ and VRCZ). Most of C. albicans, parapsilosis, and tropicalis are susceptible to FLCZ, C. glabrata is either susceptible or resistant, and C. krusei is naturally resistant. The difficult-to-identify C. auris (can be FLCZ resistant or multi-drug resistant) has been recently reported. Most cases of candiduria are not treated; however, candidemia and disseminated candidiasis can be diagnosed as a result of candiduria. An infectious disease specialist should also be consulted when candiduria requires treatment (MCFG and L-AMB have poor urinary tract penetration).",

Currently, the increase in the number of strains that produce extended-spectrum \u03b2lactamase (ESBL) among the Enterobacteriaceae is a concern [150] . Apart from carbapenems, other treatment options for ESBL-producing strains include broadspectrum penicillin with \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors combinations, cephamycin, and aminoglycosides. Observational studies have shown that these agents are not inferior to carbapenems [151] , while some RCTs have shown that carbapenems are superior [152, 153] . As empiric therapy, carbapenems are likely the first-line treatment option, particularly in critically ill patients, such as those with sepsis/septic shock. Furthermore, the number of resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species with sensitivity only to carbapenems has been increasing. It is logical to select carbapenems when these microorganisms are suspected. However, these types of resistant strains are rarely encountered in Japanese clinical settings.",

The resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa due to antimicrobial exposure is the highest, particularly to carbapenems [154, 155] . The use of carbapenems has been found to be the commonest risk factor for multidrugresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter species [156] . A meta-analysis showed that the odds ratio (OR) of the occurrence of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa due to the use of carbapenems was 7.09 (95%CI 5.43 to 9.25) [157] . The proportions of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa detected in the Japanese Nosocomial Infection Surveillance (JANIS) study were high, at 11 and 17% for meropenem and imipenem, respectively [158] . Furthermore, carbapenem use is a risk factor for the identification of carbapenemresistant Enterobacteriaceae, including carbapenemaseproducing strains [159] . The increase in the number of resistant bacteria worldwide, particularly in developing countries, has become a concern. The proportion of Gram-negative bacilli in the group of carbapenemresistant Enterobacteriaceae is still low (at less than 0.5% according to the JANIS data) [158] ; however, this is expected to increase in the future with globalization. The presence of resistant bacteria increase the inappropriateness of empiric antimicrobial therapy and are associated with poor outcomes [160] [161] [162] . Taken together, carbapenems should be used when appropriate, being aware of the risk of development of drug-resistant strains.",

This study suggested that short-term administration for fewer than 48 h could contribute to a decreased administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents without worsening vital prognosis. However, this study did not necessarily determine whether antimicrobial treatment should be suspended based on the result of culture, did not accurately conform to the PICO criteria, and was not an RCT that could directly answer this CQ. Therefore, this was not considered a study that was relevant to the systematic review of this CQ.",

Meanwhile, observational studies that compared culture-negative sepsis and culturepositive sepsis reported that there was either no difference in vital prognosis between the two groups, or a slight worsening in the latter group [30, 199] . The results of culture cannot be predicted at the initial stage when sepsis is diagnosed clinically; thus, the practice of antimicrobial agent administration after obtaining various cultures such as those of the blood is widespread. It is thought that concluding antimicrobial agent administration as rapidly as possible when culture results are confirmed to be negative and it could be comprehensively clinically determined that the illness is not sepsis is an important measure against antimicrobial resistance.",

However, there is no consensus on which initial antimicrobial agents should be selected for the treatment of sepsis. Antimicrobial agents need to be selected according to the individual patient, which imposes a large burden on the treating physician. Raineri et al. compared infection treatment among ICU patients before and after initiating consultations regarding antimicrobial agent selection with infectious disease specialists and showed that both the selection rate of appropriate antimicrobial agents and the guideline compliance rate increased through consultations, and the mortality rate decreased [200] . Antimicrobial agent selection becomes more difficult when a particular cause of sepsis cannot be specified, when advanced drug-resistant bacteria are thought to be the culprits, and when emerging/ re-emerging or imported infections with few opportunities for treatment are suspected. Therefore, consultations with infectious disease specialists or antimicrobial stewardship teams (ASTs) are expected to decrease the burden on the physician and increase the frequency of selection of appropriate antimicrobial agents.",

Furthermore, the duration of antimicrobial administration needs to be set up according to the results of blood culture tests or the presence of the previously mentioned sources. However, not all clinical departments that treat patients with sepsis have sufficient knowledge or experience in this area. Numerous observational studies that investigated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia reported that consulting with infectious disease specialists or ASTs improved the rate of compliance with guideline-based treatment (blood culture reexamination and echocardiography tests) and patient prognosis [201, 202] . Furthermore, observational studies on candidemia reported similar improvements in the rate of compliance with guidelines and patient prognosis [203] [204] [205] . These study results show that consulting with infectious disease specialists or ASTs, performing appropriate source assessment, and antimicrobial administration duration are valid for sepsis patients diagnosed with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia or candidemia.",

In other words, it has not been accurately evaluated whether increases in superinfection rates were due to de-escalation or an extended duration of antimicrobial administration. It was also reported that superinfections did not affect significant outcomes such as death. Extending the duration of antimicrobial administration due to antimicrobial deescalation was dissociated from standard clinical practice.

Outcomes for the number of days of antimicrobial drug administration (3 RCTs: n = 231) yielded a MD of 1.16 days shorter (95%CI: 2.33 shorter to 0) compared to the intervention group. Meanwhile, the estimated value of effects for sepsis recurrence as an outcome (4 RCTs: n = 261) yielded a MD of 8 more per 1000 (95%CI: 27 fewer to 113 more). The undesired effects were trivial since the confidence interval was close to the threshold for clinical decisions. Therefore, desired effects were present in 28-day mortality rate and in-hospital mortality rate, whereas undesired effects were unclear, and the certainty of the evidence was \"moderate\". However, there is insufficient research based on which to make a decision on the recurrence of sepsis, detection of drug-resistant bacteria, and the number of days of antimicrobial drug administration, as well as the limited number of facilities from which one can promptly obtain procalcitonin measurement results.",

Meta-analyses of these four studies showed that the RD of 28-day mortality (3 RCTs, n = 804) was 12 more per 1000 (95%CI: 34 fewer to 78 more); that of mortality during maximum follow-up (4 RCTs, n = 1029) was 11 more per 1000 (95%CI: 27 fewer to 62 more). The RD of clinical cures (2 RCTs, n = 392) was 50 fewer per 1000 (95%CI: 202 fewer to 144 more); that of new events (recurrence and reinfection) (3 RCTs, n = 862) was 77 more per 1000 (95%CI: 0 to 185 more). Detection of drug-resistant organisms was evaluated in two RCTs, with an RD of 132 fewer per 1000 (95%CI: 292 fewer to 166 more). Both the benefits and harms were low, and the certainty of the overall evidence was \"very low\". There were limited evidence available on sepsis or infections requiring intensive treatment.",

Therefore, the GFR should be predicted using multiple measurements of Cr levels as references.

Therefore, although exceptional, we additionally performed a systematic review of the observational studies for this CQ, The outcomes of this CQ were all-cause mortality, length of ICU stay, and all serious adverse effects. For all-cause mortality, systematic reviews of all extracted RCTs/observational studies, and systematic reviews of RCTs/observational studies limited to clindamycin-treated cases were performed, and it was set in advance to adopt the one with a lower RoB. The results of the systematic review yielded 1 RCT [303] and four observational studies [308] [309] [310] [311] that conformed to the PICO criteria, and a meta-analysis was performed on each of these. For all-cause mortality rate, RoB of the systematic review limited to CLDM-treated cases was lower, and thus was adopted for making a recommendation.

In SSCG 2016 [1] , it was stated that \"administering at least 30 mL/kg of crystalloid solution within the first 3 h is recommended for the resuscitation of patients with hypoperfusion caused by sepsis\". In three recently conducted large-scale RCTs (the ProCESS [315] , ARISE [316] , and ProMISe [314] trials), the researchers administered initial fluid resuscitation prior to the start of the protocol (i.e., before randomization), comprising 2.1-2.3 L in the ProCESS trial, 2.5-2.6 L in the ARISE trial, and 1.9-2.0 L in the ProMISe trial (approximately 30 mL/kg). The concept of early high-dose fluid therapy (30 mL/kg) against septic shock has already become commonplace, and it was thought that early goal-directed therapy administered subsequent to initial fluid resuscitation in the previously mentioned large-scale RCTs were not found to be useful. Meanwhile, Boyd et al. [324] indicated the harmful effects of fluid overload, and Murphy et al. [325] reported that fluid restriction could lead to an improved prognosis. A systematic review of 15 studies (n = 31,443) on septic shock [326] showed that excess fluid balance increased the mortality risk by 70% (pooled RR 1.70, 95%CI: 1.20 to 2.41, P = 0.003). However, those who received large volumes of fluid infusions within 3 h after the onset of sepsis (2085 mL vs. 1600 mL, P = 0.007) showed an improved in-hospital mortality rate (OR 0.34, 95%CI: 0.15-0.75, P = 0.008).",

Meanwhile, Wardi et al. [328] recommended that an initial fluid volume of less than 30 mL/kg should be administered to patients with septic shock with complications of heart failure with an ejection rate of less than 40%. There is no high-quality evidence for the initial fluid resuscitation rate or amount for sepsis/septic shock. There is also no evidence currently that rejects the concepts of compensating the relatively decreased circulating blood volume, improving tissue hypoperfusion, and balancing oxygen demand/supply promptly. An important principle is to continuously evaluate treatment effects, carefully observe vital signs during initial fluid resuscitation, and evaluate tissue oxygen metabolism and hemodynamics using lactate clearance and echocardiography, while avoiding fluid overload.",

            "text": "Dynamic parameters are better at predicting fluid responsiveness than static parameters [333] . However, there are few cases in which these can be applied in clinical settings. PPV and SVV are evaluated as reflecting fluid responsiveness if a variation of more than 12% due to positive pressure ventilation is seen when the tidal volume is more than 8 mL/kg without spontaneous breathing. The variation is likely to become larger if there is spontaneous breathing, arrhythmia, increased intra-abdominal pressure, or right heart failure. These variations also decrease in patients with tachycardia or undergoing lung protective ventilation [334] . The PPV has also been reported to be smaller when lung compliance is low [335] . Evaluation of fluid responsiveness using echocardiography includes variations in IVC and SVC diameterbased breathing, which are better predictors of fluid responsiveness than CVP [336] . It has been reported that the SVC diameter is a better parameter than the IVC diameter [337] , but evaluating the respiratory variation in the diameter of the SVC requires transesophageal echocardiography and is more invasive. Evaluations based on echocardiography are likely to be discordant among operators compared to other monitoring methods. Respiratory variations in IVC diameter are less reliable when compared to PPV or SVV [338] and should not be prioritized when PPV or SVV can be used. PLR involves an evaluation of the increased cardiac output based on lower limb elevation, and the lower limb elevation-based pre-load corresponds to approximately 250-350 mL of fluid [339] . PLR is evaluated as reflecting fluid responsiveness if an increase in cardiac output of more than 10% is observed. PLR is also useful in patients with spontaneous breathing or arrhythmia [340] . Pre-load increases due to lower limb raising are dependent on the vascular resistance of the venous system and is thus affected by vasoactive drugs and increased intraabdominal pressure [341] . The EEO is a test that temporarily occludes the airways at the exhalation terminal of mechanical ventilation, during which venous return increases because the intrathoracic pressure does not increase without ventilation. Occlusion is performed for 15 s, and this is evaluated as reflecting fluid responsiveness if an increase in cardiac output of more than 5% is observed [342] . The EEO requires tracheal intubation and ventilator management and cannot be performed among patients who cannot undergo the EEO for over 15 s due to spontaneous breathing [343] . It has been reported that the EEO is more reliable than the PPV among patients with decreased lung compliance [344] . However, validation in the prone position has not been confirmed [345] . Cardiac output should be evaluated before and after fluid loading when none of the above can be used. Low fluid volumes indicate the potential influence of measurement errors, whereas high fluid volumes increase the risk of fluid overload. It has also been reported that improved hemodynamics were temporary in approximately half of the patients who showed fluid responsiveness by fluid loading [346] . Thus, there is a need to continuously evaluate whether further fluid administration is necessary while confirming findings consistent with hypoperfusion.

However, as there is no consensus on whether to use artificial colloids as standard infusion during initial resuscitation, this was taken up as a clinically important issue. The results of a systematic review yielded four RCTs that conformed to the PICO criteria [350] [351] [352] [353] , and a meta-analysis was performed using these studies. The estimated value of the effects of short-term mortality outcomes (4 RCTs, n = 2586) was 9 more per 1000 (95%CI: 25 fewer to 46 more), and that of long-term mortality outcomes (3 RCTs, n = 2545) was 19 more per 1000. That of the outcome of length of stay in the ICU (2 RCTs, n = 214) yielded a MD of 1.13 days shorter (95%CI: 8.28 shorter to 6.03 longer). Based on the above, it was adjudged that the desired effects due to artificial colloid administration were trivial. The estimated value of the effects of outcomes of dialysis use associated with AKI yielded a RD of 16 more per 1000 (95%CI: 24 fewer to 71 more) (4 RCTs, n = 3891) and that of severe hemorrhage yielded an RD of 42 more per 1000 (95%CI: 3 more to 97 more) (2 RCTs, n = 994). Based on the above, it was adjudged that the undesired effects of artificial colloid administration were moderate. The net balance of benefits and harms was higher for the latter by 86 per 1000. Even when considering the uncertainty for short-term mortality, using the minimum values of the CI (25 fewer per 1000), and setting the relative value of outcomes relating to death at three times that of other outcomes, the harms exceeded the benefits by two per 1000. Therefore, the balance of effects was adjudged such that the \"comparative control is likely superior\" based on which we suggest against the administration of artificial colloids in patients with sepsis or septic shock.",

            "text": "Answer: There is insufficient evidence for the effects of assisted circulation such as veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO) and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for cardiac dysfunction in septic shock, and its applications are still under investigation (Provision of information for background question). Rationale Septic shock presents with not only shock due to relative decreases in intravascular volume associated with vasodilation but also cardiogenic shock due to cardiac dysfunction referred to as either SIMD or septic cardiomyopathy [372, 373] . An intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP) randomized trial (IABP-SHOCK II trial) on cardiogenic shock cases [374, 375] showed no improved prognosis in cardiogenic shock from the use of IABP. A meta-analysis that compared veno-arterial (V-A) ECMO and IABP for cardiogenic shock [376] showed that V-A ECMO was safe to use and improved hemodynamics but yielded no significant differences in 30-day survival rate and had higher bleeding-related complications. Meanwhile, the Japanese guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure (2017 revised version) [377] stated that \"routine use of IABP is not recommended, but its use is considered in severe cases of general heart failure that is not responsive to medical treatment\". Very few reports have investigated the use of IABP in patients with septic shock presenting with SIMD. Hiromi et al. [378] reported that the introduction of IABP saved the lives of two patients with sepsis; however, a study of ten patients conducted by Takahashi et al. [379] reported that the 28-day survival rate for the introduction of IABP was 30%, although hemodynamics did improve. There are some case reports and observational studies of the use of V-A ECMO for patients with septic shock presenting with SIMD; however, the survival rate widely varied from 15 to 70%. Huang et al. [380] investigated 52 patients in whom V-A ECMO was introduced and reported that the survival rate was 15% (8 patients); 40% (21 patients) experienced cardiac arrest prior to the introduction of V-A ECMO, and there is the possibility that introduction timing has a large influence on prognosis. A study conducted by Cheng et al. [381] on 151 adult patients with sepsis in whom V-A ECMO was introduced had reported a survival and discharge rate of 29.8%; however, an analysis that excluded those over the age of 75 years, patients with advanced malignant tumors, patients with end-stage heart/renal failure, and immunosuppressed patients (67 patients in total) reported a survival and discharge rate of 42%, suggesting that age and pathological conditions such as immunodeficiency may largely influence the prognosis. Meanwhile, Br\u00e9chot et al. [382] introduced V-A ECMO in 14 patients with septic shock (average ejection rate of 16%, average cardiac index of 1.3 L/min/m 2 ) and reported a survival and discharge rate of 71.4%, with follow-up observations conducted over a year later reporting favorable quality of life. It should be noted that their study included a relatively large number of young patients (average age of 45 years), but this result shows the effectiveness of V-A ECMO. Out of 37 patients in whom V-A ECMO was introduced (average age of 54.7 years), Falk et al. [383] investigated 20 patients with decreased left ventricular function (average ejection rate of 25%) and reported an in-hospital survival rate of 90% and longterm survival rate of 75%. Vogel et al. [384] introduced veno-arteriovenous (VAV) ECMO in patients with septic cardiomyopathy (12 patients) and reported a six-month survival rate of 75%. The report by Vogel et al. in particular included five patients who experienced cardiac arrest prior to the introduction of ECMO (41.7%), and these results are thought to sufficiently show the effectiveness of ECMO usage. Takauji et al. [385] examined the prognoses of 30 patients in whom V-A ECMO was introduced from a sub-analysis of the Japan Septic Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (JSEPTIC DIC) study conducted in Japan from 2011 to 2013 to and showed that the survival and discharge rate was 20%. These results were somewhat lower than those of global reports. However, the survival rate of patients who received V-V ECMO for ARDS in Japan has improved by over a factor of two from 36% (2009) to 79% (2016) [386] , and future improvements in performance are expected even with the use of V-A ECMO in adult patients with sepsis presenting with severe cardiac dysfunction. Previous studies to date have found age [380] , severe cardiomyopathy [387] , cardiac arrest prior to ECMO introduction [387] , and time from shock to introduction of ECMO [388] to be prognostic factors among adult patients with septic shock in which V-A ECMO was introduced. However, other factors such as improvements in ECMO devices and proficiency level of medical staff with regard to ECMO devices are also important, and it is thought that treatment strategies that consider these aspects are also needed. The number of reports of V-A ECMO for adult patients with sepsis remains insufficient, and many of these are single-center retrospective observational studies. There have not been any RCTs investigating the treatment effectiveness, and the efficacy of V-A ECMO and IABP in adult patients with sepsis presenting with severe cardiac dysfunction is currently under investigation.",

Regarding high-dose therapy, 2 RCTs failed to show the effectiveness of high-dose methylprednisolone in the 1980s [392, 393] . Meanwhile, since a small RCT conducted by Annane et al. reported on the effectiveness of low-dose hydrocortisone in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency in 2002, lowdose therapy has received increased attention [394] . The first edition of the SSCG published in 2004 recommended 7 days of therapy for patients who were unresponsive to initial fluid resuscitation and required vasopressors. However, a large-scale RCT (the CORTI-CUS study) conducted in 2008 merely showed earlier shock reversal without a difference in the mortality rate [395] , and the later editions of the SSCG recommended short-term hydrocortisone use in patients with septic shock who were unresponsive to fluid resuscitation and vasopressors. After a 10-year period, the results of two large-scale RCTs were published in 2018. Among these 2 RCTs, one failed to show improvements in mortality (the ADRENAL trial), whereas the other that targeted patients with more severe conditions showed significant improvements in the mortality rate (the APROCCHSS trial) [396, 397] . Thus, steroid therapies have subsequently once again been in the limelight. In the current version of the guideline, we performed a systematic review for each CQ based on the GRADE criteria, and made recommendations.",

Meanwhile, that for the shock withdrawal period (5 RCTs, n = 4661) yielded a MD of 31.53 h shorter (95%CI 36.6 shorter to 26.46 shorter) [367, 395, 396, 403] . Based on these results, desirable effects were judged as small. Meanwhile, the estimate of effect of all serious adverse effects (3 RCTs, n = 5313) was 10 fewer per 1000 (95%CI: 23 fewer to 4 more) [367, 396, 397] , that of superinfection (7 RCTs, n = 5825) was 8 more per 1000 (95%CI: 12 fewer to 31 more) [394] [395] [396] [397] [398] [399] 402] , and that of gastrointestinal bleeding (6 RCTs, n = 2161) was 6 more per 1000 (95%CI: 13 fewer to 32 more) [394, 395, [397] [398] [399] 402] . Thus, the undesirable effects were judged as trivial. In summary, the desirable effects for outcomes other than the \"shock withdrawal period\" were limited, whereas no differences in outcomes for serious adverse effects were seen regarding undesirable effects. From the perspective of an individual patient or his/her family, the balance of effects was judged as probably favoring the intervention. However, it is desirable that this intervention should not be performed as standard therapy for all patients with sepsis or septic shock. Furthermore, the RCTs selected in this analysis were all based on low-dose steroids, and this recommendation assumes that low-dose steroids are being used.",

That for long-term mortality obtained from 3 RCTs with a low RoB (3 RCTs, n = 2049) was 53 fewer per 1000 (95%CI: 11 fewer to 90 fewer) [394, 397, 404] and that for shock withdrawal (1 RCT, n = 299) was 124 more per 1000 (95%CI: 9 more to 271 more) [394] . It was adjudged from these results that the co-administration of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone yielded large desirable effects. Meanwhile, the effects for all serious adverse effects were as follows: superinfections (3 RCTs, n = 2048) yielded an effect of 33 more per 1000 (95%CI: 35 fewer to 119 more) [394, 397, 404] , gastrointestinal bleeding (2 RCTs, n = 1539) yielded an effect of 3 fewer per 1000 (95%CI: 23 fewer to 27 more) [394, 397] , and mental illness (3 RCTs, n = 299) yielded an effect of 4 fewer per 1000 (95%CI: 6 fewer to 47 more) [394, 397, 404] . This shows that the undesirable effects of co-administration of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone were trivial. In summary, the desirable effects of co-administration of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone were large, whereas the undesirable effects were trivial. Therefore, the balance of effects was judged as probably favoring the intervention [405] . The same decision would be made even when assuming worst-case scenarios (lower limit of CI for desirable effects, upper limit of CI for undesirable effects). It is desirable that this intervention be administered only among patients with septic shock that is refractory to initial fluid resuscitation and vasopressors. It should be also noted that the national health insurance coverage of fludrocortisone is limited to salt-wasting congenital adrenal hyperplasia and Addison's disease.",

Sufficient oxygen supply to the entire body is essential in cases in which balances between oxygen supply and demand are likely to be lost, including worsening hemodynamics. On the other hand, harmful effects of excessive oxygen administration have been indicated according to pathological condition [418] . Therefore, it was adjudged that indicating the target S P O 2 range as a guide (CQ9-1) could be important from a clinical perspective. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) [419] and nasal high-flow therapy (NHFT) [420] have been determined to be treatment options for pre-intubation respiratory management if normal oxygen therapy was insufficient (CQ9-2). Increased levels of attention have been paid to the indication of protective ventilation strategies (CQ9-3) and the selection of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) settings (CQ9-4) when respiratory conditions have worsened and the patient is shifted to mechanical ventilation with tracheal intubation. Meanwhile, it is theoretically desirable to administer lung protective respiratory management as it minimizes ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) caused by positive pressure ventilation and patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) caused by strong spontaneous respiration in the patient [421] . Consideration of hemodynamics according to disease stage and pathology, such as septic shock [422] , circulatory stable period, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [423] , and the convalescent period, is needed during mechanical ventilation for patients with sepsis. Successful treatment of sepsis normally results in simultaneous improvements in respiratory condition; thus, weaning from mechanical ventilation can be considered. In addition to the evaluation of airway patency [424] and airway clearance ability [425] , the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) [426] is a typical method used to judge whether mechanical support with ventilator can be withdrawn. Whether to set a protocol for the weaning process, including SBT (CQ9-5) and whether to administer preventative NIV [427] or NHFT [428] as modes of respiratory management after tracheal extubation (CQ9-6) are thought to be important clinical issues for reducing post-extubation respiratory failure or re-intubation and succeeding in weaning patients from mechanical ventilation.",

Therefore, the possibility of an increased short-term mortality rate or an increased frequency of associations with additional infection or systemic organ failure may be more strongly suggested if further investigations reveal similar results as these trials. All outcomes investigated did not support respiratory management with a high target S P O 2 , and no outcomes were investigated for desirable effects; thus, it was adjudged that respiratory management with a low target S P O 2 was likely superior. Due to the small sample size and number of trials, we conditionally suggest this after comprehensively evaluating these findings.",

Rationale A systematic review was performed on RCTs which compared groups which underwent either NIV, NHFT, or conventional oxygen therapy (COT) during respiratory management for acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Network meta-analysis methods were used to conduct comparative investigations between the three groups. The estimate of network effects for short-term mortality were as follows: when compared to COT, NHFT yielded an RD of 65 fewer per 1000 (95%CI: 95 fewer to 28 more) (5 RCTs, n = 1453) [434] [435] [436] [437] [438] ; NIV yielded an RD of 30 fewer per 1000 (95%CI: 60 fewer to 3 more) (14 RCTs, n = 2359) [434, 435, [439] [440] [441] [442] [443] [444] [445] [446] [447] [448] [449] [450] . When compared to NHFT, NIV yielded an RD of 8 fewer per 1000 (95%CI: 35 fewer to 25 more) ( [434, 458] . Furthermore, the surface under the cumulative ranking curves (SUCRAs) for short-term mortality were 77.3, 64.4, and 8.3 for NIV, NHFT, and COT, respectively. Those for tracheal intubation were 74.5, 74.7, and 0.8 for NIV, NHFT, and COT, respectively. Those for time until tracheal intubation were 40.3, 85.2, and 24.5 for NIV, NHFT, and COT, respectively. No differences in effects were observed for short-term mortality and time until tracheal intubation; however, the possibility of avoiding tracheal intubation with either NIV or NHFT was suggested. All outcomes raised as undesirable effects had low importance and were thus not included in investigations, and the evidence level of desirable effects was \"large\"; thus, it was adjudged that the balance of effects was such that intervention was likely superior. Therefore, we decided to recommend both NIV and NHFT weakly, and we conditionally suggest these after comprehensive judgment.",

            "text": "Rationale A systematic review was performed on RCTs which compared groups that received protective ventilation which limited plateau pressure by either low tidal volume or low plateau pressure and groups that did not (conventional) among critically ill patients who required mechanical ventilation management. We decided not to investigate PEEP values for either group. The results of a meta-analysis showed that the estimate of effects for short-term mortality (9 RCTs, n = 2422) were as follows: when compared to the conventional group, protective ventilation yielded an RD of 36 fewer per 1000 (95%CI: 88 fewer to 24 more) [459] [460] [461] [462] [463] [464] [465] [466] [467] , ventilator-free days (VFDs) (3 RCTs, n = 1911) yielded an MD of 1.79 days longer (95%CI: 0.62 shorter to 4.20 longer) [463, 464, 467] and barotrauma (7 RCTs, n = 2182) yielded an RD of 8 fewer per 1000 (95%CI: 31 fewer to 28 more) [459] [460] [461] [462] [463] [464] 467] . Mechanical ventilation has the dual tendency to decrease the mortality rate and increase the number of VFDs. There were no major differences in the incidence of barotrauma as an adverse event. The investigated outcomes were generally in favor of intervention; thus, it was adjudged that protective ventilation was likely superior. We conditionally suggest this after comprehensive judgment including the balance of effects and evidence level.",

The estimate of effects for undesirable effects was as follows: incidence of barotrauma (6 RCTs, n = 3457) yielded an RD of 5 more per 1000 (95%CI: 23 fewer to 53 more) [461, 464, 468, 469, 471, 472] and incidence of circulatory insufficiency (1 RCT, n = 1010) yielded an RD of 65 more per 1000 (95%CI: 6 more to 133 more) [469] . The effects of high PEEP on decreased short-term mortality and increased number of VFD were trivial and increases in barotrauma incidence as an undesirable effect were also trivial. Meanwhile, circulatory insufficiency tended to be promoted; however, it is unclear whether low PEEP settings can be adjudged as superior based on the results of this outcome, which was obtained from only one RCT. However, all subjects in this trial were diagnosed with moderate ARDS, and may have had risks associated with PEEP-induced circulatory insufficiency as backgrounds. Circulatory suppression is emphasized by high PEEP settings with septic shock; thus, further caution is required. After comprehensively evaluating these findings, we adjudged that low PEEP settings were likely superior, and conditionally suggest this.",

Weaning protocols for mechanical ventilators, including SBT, tended to decrease short-term mortality and re-intubation rates; however, the evidence level for each outcome was extremely low.

Network meta-analysis methods were used to comparatively investigate the three groups. The estimate of network effects for shortterm mortality was as follows: compared to COT, NHFT yielded an RD of 12 fewer per 1000 (95%CI: 32 fewer to 16 more) (4 RCTs, n = 802) [483] [484] [485] [486] , NIV yielded an RD of 31 fewer per 1000 (95%CI: 53 fewer to 1 more) (5 RCTs, n = 784) [487] [488] [489] [490] [491] . When compared to NHFT, NIV yielded an RD of 43 fewer per 1000 (95%CI: 102 fewer to 32 more) (1 RCT, n = 604) [492] . The estimate of network effects for the rate of re-intubation were as follows: compared to COT, NHFT yielded an RD of 69 fewer per 1000 (95%CI: 99 fewer to 12 fewer) (5 RCTs, n = 864) [483] [484] [485] [486] 493] and NIV yielded an RD of 66 fewer per 1000 (95%CI: 99 fewer to 1 fewer) (4 RCTs, n = 664) [487] [488] [489] 491] . When compared to NHFT, NIV yielded an RD of 16 more per 1000 (95%CI: 109 fewer to 271 more) (1 RCT, n = 604) [492] . The SUCRA values for short-term mortality were 91.8, 46.3, and 11.8 for NIV, NHFT, and COT, respectively. The SUCRA values for re-intubation were 69.8, 77.8, and 2.8 for NIV, NHFT, and COT, respectively. There was no difference in effects for the desirable effect of decreased short-term mortality; however, NIV and NHFT yielded decreased re-intubation rates compared to COT, and it was shown that both NIV and NHFT could potentially prevent re-intubation. All outcomes raised as undesirable effects were of low importance and thus not included in investigations, and the evidence level of desirable effects was \"moderate\"; therefore, based on the balance of effects, it was adjudged that intervention was likely superior. Consequently, we decided to recommend both NIV and NHFT weakly, and after comprehensive judgment, we conditionally suggested this.",

However, most of the clinical research that serves as the basis for the decisions in these guidelines includes critically ill patients with various pathological conditions (including postoperative patients) as subjects, and very few studies have been conducted only on sepsis. However, there is no evidence that PAD management in sepsis differs from the management of other critically ill patients. Therefore, the \"analgesia/sedation/delirium management\" in the J-SSCG 2016 [3, 4] was created as an excerpt from the J-PAD guidelines [496] . This guideline set six CQs for the management of pain, agitation, and delirium in sepsis patients, and a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to the new GRADE system. A literature review assessed patients with severe illnesses other than sepsis in these CQs.",

CQs were established to balance the benefits and risks of pain management methods. The prevention of agitation is extremely important for shortening the duration of ventilator management and length of stay in the ICU. As these outcomes are directly linked to patient prognosis, CQs related to the differences in agitation management, such as the selection of sedatives and light sedation practices, were established. Delirium is a phenotype of central nervous system organ damage in septic patients. It is known that there is a correlation between the duration of delirium in the ICU and cognitive impairments occurring within 3 and 12 months of discharge from the ICU. CQs related to delirium prevention methods and treatment methods have been established.",

The pathophysiology of septic AKI is complex, and disorders, such as those of the inflammatory response and mitochondrial dysfunction, are assumed to contribute to the pathogenesis of AKI in addition to dysregulated hemodynamics [553] . Meanwhile, no drugs have been clinically proven to reduce the incidence of AKI. Diuretics are commonly administered for septic AKI, with the aim of fluid management. Therefore, this guideline adopted CQs related to the administration of furosemide (11-1) and atrial natriuretic peptides .

Therefore, appropriately setting the prescribed dose of RRT is important in the treatment of septic AKI, and this was chosen as a CQ to be investigated. Although the standard prescribed dose in Japanese insurance practice is approximately 15 mL/kg/h, the international standard dose is 25 mL/kg/h; thus, attention is needed when interpreting the results of research conducted outside Japan.",

The latter includes cases that begin with small amounts and ultimately aims to administer an amount commensurate with the energy consumed, or methods that aim from the outset to administer an amount of energy commensurate with that consumed and decrease the amount when the residual gastric amount increases or when symptoms of intolerance such as diarrhea occur. In CQ12-5, we examined whether supplemental parenteral nutrition should be added when the target amount of energy cannot be administered via enteral nutrition alone. In CQ12-6, we investigated the optimal protein dose in the acute phase. The systematic review compared doses less than 1 g/kg/day and more than 1 g/kg/day because the currently recommended dose of protein administration in Japan is less than 1 g/ kg/day [603] and the lower recommended limit in several guidelines was 1.2-1.3 g/kg/day [604] [605] [606] .",

The estimated values of the desirable anticipated effects were as follows: 28-day mortality yielded a RD of 55 fewer per 1000 (95%CI: 131 fewer to 52 more) (5 RCTs, n = 1646), in-hospital mortality yielded an RD of 25 fewer per 1000 (95%CI: 105 fewer to 83 more) (7 RCTs, n = 1798), the length of stay in the ICU yielded a MD of 0.58 days shorter (95%CI: 1.45 shorter to 0.28 longer) (6 RCTs, n = 1394), and AKI yielded an RD of 18 fewer per 1000 (95%CI: 111 fewer to 92 more) (2 RCTs, n = 248). Of these two RCTs which used AKI as an outcome (Fujii et al., 2020 [608] ; Tanaka et al., 2000 [677] ), that conducted by Tanaka et al. (2000) [677] was a small-scale study (37 patients) and reported an AKI incidence rate of 0% for both the intervention and control groups. The estimated value of effects for AKI was largely due to the report published by Fujii et al. (2020) [608] . The study showed slightly decreasing tendencies for both 28-day and 90-day mortality, and this was thought to imply an improvement in extremely serious outcomes for patients, such that the desirable anticipated effect was judged to be \"small\". Meanwhile, the estimated value of length of hospital stay yielded an MD of 0.64 days longer (95%CI: 1.24 shorter to 2.52 longer) (5 RCTs, n = 1556) as the undesirable anticipated effect. The length of stay in the hospital tended to be prolonged due to vitamin C administration; however, this duration was thought to be extremely short. Based on the above, it was thought that the undesirable anticipated effects were \"trivial\". Thus, we thought that vitamin C was superior to placebo or control.

However, a report has also indicated that increase in feeding tube obstruction (which could be partly due to curd formation [solidification] of the proteins in the gastric contents refluxed at the time of measurement) and unnecessary enteral nutrition suspension (e.g., suspension even when the gastric residue is in a clinically nonproblematic state), in turn reduce the enteral nutrition dose as a result and had no influence on prognosis [700] . Some researchers recommend suspending enteral nutrition and searching for the cause when more than 500 mL of fluid is withdrawn with a single round of suction [605] .

However, the energy debt created in these cases must be given due consideration. Energy debt is the cumulative difference between the amount of energy consumed and administered, and a larger energy debt has been reported to result in a worsened prognosis [701, 702] . Limited observational studies have shown the relationship between energy debt and prognosis, and these results may be affected by confounding factors. However, it is self-evident that large energy debts have negative influences on patients' immunity and body composition, and it is thought that sufficient energy must be administered when transitioning from the acute phase to the recovery phase.",

Many clinical trials of acute-phase nutritional therapy have an intervention limit of approximately 7 days [649, 653, 656, 660] , and the general strategy has been to administer nutrition that satisfies the required energy (about 25-30 kcal/kg/day, including proteins) after that, including previous energy debts [604, 605] . As a reference, a RCT of acute lung injuries [703] showed that patient groups with high energy doses had a high mortality rate when nutrition was administered prior to the seventh day, and a conversely low mortality rate tendency when nutrition was administered on the eighth day onwards. These results suggest the need for a review of nutrition therapy when transitioning from the acute phase to the recovery phase.",

The estimated value of effects (per 1000 measurements) for the onset of measurement errors outside of the acceptable range yielded a RD of 45 more per 1000 (95%CI: 11 more to 164 more) (3 studies, n = 2800) [705] [706] [707] when the glucometer (capillary blood) was compared to the blood gas analyzer (arterial blood/venous blood). The RD was 58 more per 1000 (95%CI: 12 more to 134 more) (8 studies, n = 5924) [705] [706] [707] [708] [709] [710] [711] [712] when the glucometer using capillary blood was compared to that using arterial blood/venous blood. The RD was 39 more per 1000 (95%CI: 14 more to 90 more) (3 studies, n = 5075) [705] [706] [707] when the glucometer (capillary blood) was compared to the blood gas analyzer/glucometer (arterial blood/venous blood).

Therefore, it was determined that the desirable anticipated effects of the glucometer using capillary blood were trivial. Hyperglycemia increases the incidences of mortality and infection, whereas hypoglycemia contributes to the incidences of neuropathy and mortality. Among patients in whom measurements have large errors, opportunities for rapid treatment may be lost. Measurement methods with glucometer using capillary blood had approximately 39 to 58 more measurement errors outside the acceptable range per 1000 measurements when compared to measurement methods with blood gas analyzers or glucometer using arterial blood/venous blood. Thus, the undesirable effects were moderate. Based on the above, we thought that measurement methods with either blood gas analyzers or glucometer using arterial blood/venous blood were likely superior to measurement methods with glucometer using capillary blood.",

Abnormal body temperatures are often observed in patients with sepsis. Registry studies of sepsis patients in Japan reported that body temperatures at the time of ICU admission were as follows: less than 36\u00b0C, 11.1%; 36-38\u00b0C, 49.4%; and > 38\u00b0C, 39.4% [750] . A multi-center prospective observational study conducted across 25 facilities in Japan and South Korea (the FACE study) reported that 40.5 and 11.5% of ICU patients experienced fever with temperatures over 38.5\u00b0C and over 39.5\u00b0C, respectively [751] .",

The fibrinolytic function is also activated in response to activation of coagulation in DIC; however, its extent varies according to the underlying disease. DIC is subclassified into the fibrinolysis-suppressing and fibrinolytic types. The fibrinolytic function is usually insufficient for activated coagulation in DIC caused by sepsis.

As many clinicians consider septic DIC as a target for the anticoagulant therapies, and early initiation is more effective in Japan, they require an indicator that makes early stage treatment possible. In contrast, since clinicians in other countries do not consider septic DIC as a specific target for treatment, strict diagnostic criteria to accurately assess the pathophysiological conditions are more suitable.

The diagnosis and treatment of septic DIC should be rapidly performed; however, it is important to look back at the diagnosis when the treatment response is poor or the clinical signs are atypical. In such a situation, the possibility of TMA should be kept in mind and the treatment must be promptly switched to the specific treatment for each disease (e.g., plasma exchange, molecular-targeted therapy, etc.) [788] . In addition, there is need for an early discrimination of HIT which often complicates thrombosis with thrombocytopenia. Clinically, screening for HIT can be made with 4Ts scoring [789] , and more accurately with the detection of antibodies. Meanwhile, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome [790] is a severe form of pregnancy-induced hypertensive syndrome that rapidly improves through delivery; thus, it can be relatively easily differentiated during clinical diagnosis. However, congenital TTP and aHUS can secondarily occur or coexist through the increase in the level of vWF during pregnancy and caution must be taken in such cases [791] .

Mechanical prophylaxis as a mode of VTE prophylaxis leads to an increased risk of inducing blood flow disorders in the compressed area. Furthermore, anticoagulation therapy has the risk of inducing hemorrhaging complications. Based on these facts, it is thought that VTE prophylaxis should not be administered indiscriminately. However, the optimal period of VTE prophylaxis administration to sepsis patients has not been established, and decisions of the suspension period varies by facility or attending physician even in clinical practice.

PICS refers to the physical, cognitive, and mental impairments that occur during or after admission to the ICU and after discharge from the hospital. ICU-AW, which is the physical component of PICS, is a syndrome that presents with acute symmetric limb weakness that develops after admission to the ICU. Both PICS and ICU-AW are widely being recognized as affecting not only the long-term prognosis of ICU patients but also the mental states of their families. There have been various recent reports on PICS and ICU-AW [817, 818] , and this chapter set the three interventions of early rehabilitation, passive joint exercise therapy, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy as CQs and investigated their effectiveness through a meta-analysis. Understanding PICS and ICU-AW and their interventions should have the objective of rehabilitation, which goes beyond saving the lives of patients receiving intensive care, and collaboration with healthcare professionals not involved in intensive care is also necessary. Both are attracting attention as new issues in the field of intensive care, and it is important to share the latest knowledge on the prevention and treatment at the onset.",

These bacteria are usually sensitive to cefotaxime, which is a third-generation cephalosporin. However, Listeria has a relatively high frequency of involvement among children younger than 1 month with sepsis [833] , the addition of ampicillin should be considered. Cephalosporin-and carbapenem-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae should be considered when the possibility of meningitis is high in children 1 month after birth [834, 835] , and the possibility of adding vancomycin should be assessed [836] . Finally, patient background such as underlying illness, immune states such as primary immunodeficiency and asplenia, and the surrounding epidemic history should be considered when selecting antibiotics. In recent years, the prevalence of extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamases (ESBL) producing bacteria among the Enterobacteriaceae has been increasing [837] .

Large-scale observational studies conducted in North America showed that, among 26,533 patients younger than 60 days who visited the ER (no record of the number of sepsis patients), those with HSV infection remained at 112 (0.42%), of which 36 patients (0.14%; 95%CI: 0.10 to 0.19%) had the central nervous system type and 32 patients (0.12%; 95%CI: 0.08 to 0.17%) had the systemic type [845] . In other words, the incidence is extremely low, and it can be said that the proportion of patients for whom favorable effects would be achieved with anti-herpetic drug administration as an empiric treatment is extremely limited. In reality, in the studies mentioned above, anti-herpetic drugs should have been administered as empiric treatment among 588 patients (95%CI: 435 to 769) in order to treat one patient each younger than 60 days with the central nervous system-and systemic-type of HSV infection. The median age of patients with HSV infection was 14 days (interquartile range [IQR] 9 to 24), and the contraction frequency was higher among patients aged 0-28 days than among those aged 29-60 days (odds ratio 3.9; 95%CI: 2.4 to 6.2). This would mean that 152 (95%CI: 123 to 185) and 583 (95%CI: 384 to 909) patients, respectively, would have started receiving anti-herpetic drugs as empiric treatment to treat a single patient each with HSV infection aged 0-28 days and 29-60 days [845] .

Clinical findings such as the correction of tachycardia or hypotension, improvements in the pulsation, and reductions in peripheral/central system temperature differences suggest an increase in the stroke volume and cardiac output.

Multiple observational studies in the field of pediatrics have also indicated that hyperlactemia at the time of diagnosis was correlated with an increased mortality rate [860] [861] [862] , that the lack of decreases in lactate level with fluid-or cardiovascular agent-based interventions was correlated with mortality [863, 864] , and that normalized lactate levels were correlated with recovery of organ function [865] . Meanwhile, it was indicated that cases of pediatric septic shock diagnosed based on clinical findings did not always present with hyperlactemia, regardless of whether the shock pattern was compensatory or non-compensatory (i.e., hypotensive) [848] . As such, decreases in lactate levels due to fluid resuscitation can be used as an assessment indicator for determining effectiveness only in patients whose lactate levels elevated on presentation. However, the cut-off value for lactate clearance that can be deemed effective is not clear, and this needs to be determined with other hemodynamic indicators, similar to that of the CRT. It should be noted that a recent RCT that evaluated hemodynamic management with CRT normalization compared with that of lactate clearance in septic shock among adults showed that the former was not superior to the latter in terms of 28day mortality [319] .",

            "text": "Rationale Three RCTs were included in the analysis for mortality (n = 155) [824, 825, 881] , and the estimated effects yielded a risk difference of 40 fewer per 1000 (95%CI: 167 fewer to 130 more). Furthermore, 2 RCTs were analyzed for time to recovery from shock [825, 881] . One RCT (n = 68) [825] showed averages of 60.0 h (routine steroid administration group) and 139.2 h (comparative control group). The other RCT (n = 38) [881] showed median values of 49.5 h (routine steroid administration group) and 70 h (comparative control group), with effects estimated to be present to some extent. Therefore, the desirable effects were deemed small. In terms of the risk of secondary infection (2 RCTs, n = 87) [824, 881] , the estimated effects yielded a risk difference of 41 more per 1000 (95%CI: 73 fewer to 284 more). Two RCTs were analyzed in terms of the length of stay in hospital [824, 825] . One RCT (n = 68) [825] showed averages of 11.4 days (routine steroid administration group) and 8.2 days (comparative control group), and the other RCT (n = 49) [824] showed median values of 10.7 days (routine steroid administration group) and 9.6 days (comparative control group), with slight extensions estimated in the intervention group. Therefore, the desirable effects were deemed small. Based on the above, both the desirable and undesirable effects of the intervention were deemed small, and we adjudged that neither the intervention nor the comparative control could be supported regardless of the relative value of outcomes placed by patients and families.",

Serious adverse effects of IVIG include anaphylaxis, acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, aseptic meningitis, and extravasation, which are not serious and rare. Thus, the undesirable effects are deemed trivial. Both the desirable and undesirable effects are trivial, and neither the intervention nor the comparative controls are superior to the other.

In contrast, hypoglycemia induced by insulin is an important hazard of glycemic control and has been associated with poor prognoses among critically ill children [891, 894] . Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to determine whether to exercise tight glycemic control in children with sepsis.

(2) If myoclonus is present and the state of altered consciousness is mild, the possibility of electrolyte abnormalities, uremia, metabolic abnormalities such as hepatic encephalopathy, or drug-induced encephalopathy due to antibacterial drugs should be considered, and both biochemical tests and confirmation of the drug used should be prioritized. The European Society of Intensive Care Medicine recommends that the possibility of complications of non-convulsive status epilepticus should be considered in patients with metabolic abnormalities due to renal or liver injury or when drug-induced encephalopathy due to antibacterial drugs is the cause, and that continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring should be performed [906] . (3) If the patient is comatose, non-convulsive status epilepticus, metabolic abnormalities, and drugs are ranked higher in the differentiation. However, it is important to first rule out organ-based disease complications such as intracranial hemorrhage, which require emergency intervention. Blood investigations and drugs are confirmed after conducting neuroimaging tests. If the causes are still unclear, continuous EEG monitoring should be performed if possible. In cases in which overdose or prolonged administration of analgesics or sedatives are suspected, antagonists such as flumazenil and naloxone should be administered, and improvements in the level of consciousness should be confirmed. If there is no evidence of seizure waves on the EEG, and the EEG predominantly shows slow waves, theta waves, or suppression patterns, narrowly defined sepsisassociated brain damage, or broadly defined sepsisassociated brain damage, such as diffuse cerebral ischemia due to hypoperfusion, analgesic overdose, or prolongation of its effects can be differentiated as the causes of altered states of consciousness [900] . (4) If the patient is in a state of agitation or hyperkinetic delirium, electrolyte abnormalities and metabolic abnormalities should be confirmed as well as any drugs or unnecessary devices that prolong delirium. Alcohol use and benzodiazepine withdrawal are often overlooked as causes of delirium, and it is important to confirm the past drug history, amount of alcohol consumed, and final alcohol consumption [901] .",

It is often impossible to differentiate which among combinations of infectious endocarditis and meningitis is secondary, and the frequency of meningitis in infectious endocarditis varies according to each study, ranging from 0 to 20% [907, 908] . Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the most common causative bacteria of secondary meningitis from distant sources [907, 908] . Retrospective studies that investigated 1025 meningitis patients showed that Staphylococcus aureus (33%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (54%) accounted for a majority of the causative bacteria among patients who had both meningitis and infectious endocarditis [909, 910] .

Meanwhile, a multilateral RCT that targeted sepsis patients [912] showed that of 2130 patients with independent lifestyles prior to hospitalization, approximately one-third died within 6 months, and of the 580 patients for whom quality of life measurements could be performed after 6 months, 41.6% were unable to have independent lifestyles. In light of these circumstances, the Society of Critical Care Medicine proposed the important concept of PICS in 2012 [816] . PICS is physical, cognitive, or mental impairment that occurs during or after discharge from the ICU, or even after discharge from the hospital. It is a pathological condition that affects not only the long-term prognoses of critically ill patients who require intensive care for conditions such as sepsis, but also the mental health of their families. Japan in particular is an aging country unlike any in the world, and more than 25% of its total population is over the age of 65 years [913] . A structure in which there is an increasing number of people in need of care as the lifesaving rate increases cannot be said to be a healthy state from a social perspective, and it is self-evident that the ways in which PICS can be prevented and improved will become an increasingly serious problem in sepsis treatment in the future.",

According to a survey of members of the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine (453 respondents), early rehabilitation was initiated in 92.1% of respondents, due in part to recommendations made by guidelines and support with regard to medical fees [914] . Meanwhile, approximately 40% of respondents' facilities were either unaware of or did not use the terms PICS or ABCDEF bundles [914] . Intensive care should be individualized. Furthermore, the ICU is a site for intensive care; however, it is also a place in which patients live. There are many CQs that should be considered: what considerations are necessary during an ICU stay in order to administer clinical treatments that respect the humanity of patients with various value systems and ways of thinking?, what should the relationship be between patients and their families?, and what should health professionals do in order to provide mental support to these people? In this context, the J-SSCG 2020 contains a new independent chapter, in which \"Patientand Family-Centered Care\" was taken up as a topic. Content primarily relating to physical function was addressed in the chapter regarding \"ICU-AW/PICS/early rehabilitation\", whereas the chapter on \"Patientand Family-Centered Care\" was positioned to handle content relating to the mental state of patients and their families, and the care environment and decision-making support in the ICU. A total of six CQs, including two background questions, were taken up by a multidisciplinary working group for this chapter. There are some with poor levels of evidence; however, these are extremely important areas that can improve the quality of future sepsis treatment and intensive care. We hope that \"Patientand Family-Centered Care\", which respects the humanity of the individual patient and family, will serve as a basis for exploring what the main concepts in this subject should be.",

It is difficult for patients and their families to obtain information relating to PICS and PICS-Family (PICS-F) when many health professionals working in the ICU are unfamiliar with PICS. Meanwhile, PICS and PICS-F occur at a high rate among sepsis patients and their families, respectively [915] . For this reason, many patients and their families confront PICS and PICS-F with insufficient information and live with various forms of pain, anxiety, fear, and conflicts toward treatment. Accurately, yet continuously providing information relating to PICS and PICS-F to patients and families can lead to understanding and reassurance that PICS and PICS-F are not special abnormalities that only occur among patients or their loved ones [916] . Furthermore, this may lead to advanced prediction, early detection, and rapid response to PICS and PICS-F [916] .",

Appropriate information can be provided by creating a leaflet that includes an overview of PICS and PICS-F, their symptoms, and contact information, which can then be handed out to patients and their families upon ICU admission/discharge. It is important in such cases that there is dual communication among patients, their families, and health professionals so that this does not end with one-sided provision of information. A multi-center RCT showed that providing leaflets which included an overview of the ICU and information relating to medical equipment, improved family understanding and satisfaction [917] . However, little research has verified the usefulness of providing leaflets that includes information on PICS and PICS-F, and further research is needed.",

A report has indicated that 46% of patients had false delusional memories such as nightmares or hallucinations after discharge from the ICU [918] . Rounds and visits after discharge from the ICU do not only compensate for discrepancies and unclear aspects relating to ICU experience and treatment understanding, but also assess disease conditions and dysfunction. It is expected that this may have the effect of adjusting at an early stage the need for ICU readmission and appropriate specialist outpatient consultations, in coordination with the attending physician. A qualitative study [919] reported that visits after ICU discharge helped with the understanding of the ICU experience, and a report has indicated that the use of support programs for correcting memory distortions during visits after discharge from the ICU resulted in significant improvements in anxiety, depression, and stress disorders after discharge from the hospital [920] .",

The primary medical care provided during outpatient followups included physical, mental, and cognitive function, and quality of life (QOL) assessments using screening tools, rehabilitation, mental/cognitive function support, introduction to the appropriate specialist outpatient, and medication management. An RCT was conducted in three facilities in the UK to assess the effectiveness of outpatient follow-ups; however, no significant improvements in QOL, anxiety, depression, or PTSD were observed at 12 months after hospital discharge [922] . Outpatient follow-ups forms and methods as well as subject patients, have not been sufficiently studied, and further detailed studies are needed in the future.

Surveys conducted in Japan indicated that many Japanese citizens wished to decide their own treatment policy upon consultation with or explanation from their physicians [968] . Meanwhile, a report indicated examples in which the treatment policy was changed upon the decision of other family members, regardless of the decision on the treatment policy made by the patients themselves or surrogate decision makers [969] . In such a context, decision-making support based on informed consent or advance directives (ADs) has been promoted; however, a large-scale cluster RCT that validated the effectiveness of AD showed no significant improvements in the quality of care and patient outcomes [970] . This was because it was difficult for the patients themselves to make predictions due to the complexity of the actual circumstances, and that it was not clear whether the decision made at the time would remain the same on the present day. There are rapid changes in medical conditions and the environment, particularly in the fields of emergency/intensive care; thus, these tendencies are thought to be pronounced here. For these reasons, discussions over time, rather than informed consent and AD at a single moment in time, have become more important.",

            "text": "Shared decision-making (SDM) and advance care planning (ACP) have recently been proposed. These methods are a continuous and two-way process that supports decision-making by patients and their families (including not only families, but acquaintances and friends trusted by patients and whom they would like to make treatment/care decisions on their behalf). Health professionals provide accurate information that serves as evidence of patients' conditions and treatment options/ methods, and patients and their families can provide information such as the value systems and ways of thinking of the patients themselves. Patient-based decision-making is the basis of this process, and it has been proposed that treatment policy decisions are made through discussions in repeated multi-disciplinary conferences [971] . SDM is the process of dialogue and thinking about what is best for patients, which in turn serves as the basis for ACP. When the patient cannot confirm their ways of thinking, surrogate decision makers such as family and others should be carefully identified, the estimated ways of thinking of the patient are respected, and the best policy for the patient is proposed. Furthermore, if the family or others are unable to presume the patient's ways of thinking, there is a method by which sufficient discussion with the family and others is held through multi-disciplinary conferences, based on the policy of what is best for the patient [971]. These methods are not completed once a decision has been made, and it is considered important to repeat this process according to the passage of time, changes in the mental and physical conditions of the patient, and changes in medical assessments. Furthermore, it is recommended that the contents of the discussion during this process should be recorded in writing each time [971] .",

In the J-SSCG 2020, a new section on the sepsis treatment system (STS) was included to respond to such changes in the treatment system, and CQs on the system of treating sepsis were included. The basic thought process underlying the STS is that the early recognition and awareness of sepsis and its treatment using an appropriate system leads to improvements in treatment performance. Guidelines also play an important role in activities of awareness such as increasing awareness and recognition of the severity of sepsis or the significance of creating appropriate treatment systems even for the general public and medical professionals who are not involved in sepsis treatment. Furthermore, the ways in which sepsis treatment should be evaluated to ensure diagnostic and treatment quality are included in this section. All medical staff must be able to use the sepsis early detection system to use it effectively. The rapid response system (RRS) is one that can reliably report changes in a patient's medical condition and respond immediately to such a report. Therefore, the following two CQs relate to a system of early recognition of sepsis, \"What are the methods for detecting sepsis at an early stage in the general ward and ER?\" and \"What is the role of a rapid response system (RRS) which acts against changes in the condition of patients in the general ward where sepsis is suspected?\", have been presented.",

Sepsis-3 uses the SOFA score in organ failure assessment. This in turn requires blood tests and blood gas analysis, which are time-consuming procedures, making this a complicated option for screening. As such, a simple screening method that can be used at the bedside is needed for general hospital wards and ERs. These types of patients who progress to organ failure often exhibit some form of vital sign abnormalities from the early stage of sepsis.

Furthermore, the Early Warning Score (EWS), which assigns individual weights to multiple vital signs and scores them, is often used in the RRS activation criteria.

There are mild cases that can be treated even in general wards. Patients with severe sepsis need to be transferred to hospital beds with a high care level, and a suitable hospital bed needs to be selected by assessing the severity of the disease. There is a concern that environments that cannot sufficiently provide the medical resources needed for treatment (e.g., staffing with appropriate medical skills, monitoring, and equipment including ventilators) may have negative effects on patient prognosis. Appropriate bed selection varies relative to the function, scale, and bed usage situation of each facility; thus, it is not possible to relate severity to appropriate bed classification in a generalized manner [988] , but this committee recommends this CQ as a good practice statement in order to provide a necessary intensive treatment. It should be noted that transfer risks, distance, and methods need to be considered when transporting patients out of the hospital.",

The Society of Critical Care Medicine ICU Admission, Discharge and Triage Guidelines cites life-threatening sepsis as an example of a level 2C recommendation (suggestion, low evidence level) for admission to the ICU [989] . Considering that this guideline is intended for general medical practitioners who institute treatments in environments without an ICU, and that the criteria would not be effective unless it was as simple as possible due to the diverse phenotype of sepsis, we set a criterion of \"when the patient is unresponsive to initial fluid resuscitation\" for transfer to a site where intensive treatment is possible. We made the assumption of septic shock, but also considered that lactate levels (which are a requirement by definition) cannot be determined at many facilities. Furthermore, although \"unresponsive\" is a vague term, we made this recommendation with the decision that some flexibility is needed according to the medical resources available at each facility. The categories of non-responsiveness include persistent hypotension, prolonged disturbances of consciousness, poor respiratory status, and poor lactate clearance. However, it is important to comprehensively determine not only the severity but also the necessary medical resources and recovery prospects [989] .",

Sepsis is a highly fatal condition that induces multiple organ dysfunction, and in the same way that a similar treatment algorithm was shown in the pediatric chapter of this guideline, transitioning to intensive care management when the patient is \"unresponsive to initial fluid resuscitation\" is likely valid. In other words, if it is possible to transfer a patient to a bed at a hospital with intensive care and there is an ICU nearby that is capable of managing severely ill children, transfer out of the hospital to that unit should be considered. This is known to be correlated with an increased number of patients and a favorable treatment performance for severely ill pediatric patients, in addition to those with sepsis [990] [991] [992] [993] . Furthermore, reports have indicated that vital prognosis does not worsen if a team with the skills and equipment to transfer severely ill children do this [994] [995] [996] , and this should be considered when examining the adequacy and methods of inter-hospital transport.",

Reports among patients not limited to those with sepsis include the following [997] [998] [999] [1000] [1001] [1002] [1003] . A delay of an hour due to maximum ICU capacity was shown to increase the adjusted risk ratio of ICU mortality to 1.015 (95%CI: \u2212 1.006 to 1.023). Groups in which worsening of symptoms on the general ward to consultation by an ICU team was delayed (> 7.7 h) had an increased 30-day mortality rate (adjusted OR 1.8; 95%CI: 1.1 to 2.9) when compared to groups which experienced no delay (< 1 h). A duration of more than 6 h from when the patient was deemed severely ill with the EWS to ICU transfer increased the in-hospital mortality rate (33.2% vs. 24.5%, P < 0.001), with the odds ratio of in-hospital mortality increasing by 3% for every hour of delay. RCTs are virtually impossible in this field, and a consensus was reached with the current evidence that critically ill patients should be managed at the ICU even in the Admission, Discharge, and Triage Guidelines [989] . This is more limited with regard to sepsis, but a report has indicated that every hour of delay from hospital visit to ICU admission in severe septic/septic shock increased the adjusted odds ratio of the mortality rate by 1.11 (95%CI: 1.01 to 1.02) [1004] .",

Detecting sepsis at an earlier stage and progressing with treatment that follows the EGDT protocol was thought to be effective in conventional initial-stage treatment of sepsis, and has been recommended in previous guidelines [984] . However, as shown in the results of the ProCESS trial published in 2014, it was confirmed that prognosis did not improve with the EGDT protocol [314] [315] [316] . With a focus on these results, in 2015, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) of the United States government established the Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock Early Management Bundle (SEP-1) in the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program as a QI for sepsis treatment [1008] . Since then, the strategy has changed from a conventional protocol-based treatment to advance the achievement of the treatment bundle. As such, each of the items taken up as a bundle is important from the perspective of monitoring treatment quality in sepsis. The SEP-1 QI has six items: (1) blood culture implementation, (2) lactate level measurement and (3) appropriate antibacterial drug administration within 3 h of sepsis onset; (4) 30 mL/kg of fluid resuscitation in cases of septic shock, (5) repeated lactate level measurements within 6 h if initial lactate levels exceed 2.0 mmol/L, and (6) use of vasoactive agents when hypotension is prolonged [1009] . Furthermore, although not stated in SEP-1, the initial response to septic shock does not only include the possible need for fluid resuscitation, but also intravascular volume and cardiac function assessments using ultrasound tests [1010] .",

Recent improvements in the quality of management for these patients have decreased the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding to 2-5% [1018] . However, preventing stress ulcers is important because the onset of upper gastrointestinal bleeding was correlated with an increased mortality rate [1019] . Preventative methods include the administration of anti-ulcer drugs such as acid-suppressive medications, antacids, and mucosa protective anti-gastric ulcer drugs. However, changes in bacterial gut flora can occur due to increases in the pH of gastric acid following the administration of anti-ulcer drugs, and this can promote the colonization of pathogens that cause ventilator-associated infections in the stomach, trachea, and bronchi, and in turn increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia [1020] . Among acidsuppressive medications, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may also increase the risk of Clostridioides difficile infection [1020] . In this way, there are both benefits and harms in prevention using anti-ulcer drugs; thus, this was verified in CQ22-1. This systematic review included histamine 2 (H 2 ) receptor blockers, PPIs, and sucralfate as anti-ulcer drugs; however, there have not been any investigations on the superiority of any of these drugs. Regarding the relative superiority of these drugs, PPIs were shown to have the highest preventative effects against upper gastrointestinal bleeding through network meta-analysis; however, they have been reported to potentially increase the risk of pneumonia, and this should be used as a reference [1021] .",

Ulceration increases the risk of bleeding because insults such as sepsis are often accompanied by dysfunctional hemostasis/coagulation, such as thrombocytopenia and DIC. The clinical factors that determine whether anti-ulcer agents may be discontinued include whether the general condition improves and the patient enters a recovery phase, if the risk of ulceration is reduced, or if hemostatic coagulation dysfunction is improved and the risk of bleeding is reduced. Meanwhile, anti-ulcer drugs should be carefully discontinued in the following cases: 1) administration of drugs with adverse effects of ulcer formation, such as steroids or non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 2) administration of anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents, 3) patients with a history of ulcers, or 4) when there are concerns about disorders of gastric or duodenal blood flow [1052] .",

Patients among whom PPIs or H 2 receptor blockers are thought to be the cause recover relatively quickly with the discontinuation of drug administration, and some reports have stated that patients recovered in an average of 7 days after the discontinuation of the drug [1053] . Thus, the adverse effects of drugs may determine the discontinuation of anti-ulcer agents. Drugs of another class should be used (e.g., PPI to an H 2 receptor blocker), if the risk of peptic ulcers is high even with adverse effects due to anti-ulcer agents.

In critically ill patients, such as those with sepsis, the lack of increase in gastric pH due to fasting is thought to be the cause of peptic ulcer formation, in addition to various stressors. Therefore, the administration of anti-ulcer agents is a logical decision because the stomach pH does not easily increase during fasting or when enteral nutrition doses via gastric administration are minimal. It has been reported that enteral nutrition via gastric administration has a gastric acid buffering effect similar to that of a regular diet, and the continuous administration of enteral nutrition has the potential to increase the pH more than H 2 receptor blockers and PPIs in critically ill patients [1054] . Based on these results, it is expected that the gastric pH would increase with sufficient amounts of enteral nutrition via gastric administration, which may be a factor in deciding to discontinue anti-ulcer agents. A recent meta-analysis reported that there were no significant differences in the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding between patients who received enteral nutrition alone and those who received enteral nutrition with anti-ulcer agents; instead, groups who received concomitant anti-ulcer agents had a significantly higher risk of pneumonia [1055] . Meanwhile, increases in pH due to nutrition are thought to be unlikely when enteral nutrition is administered via the jejunum; thus, the administration of anti-ulcer agents may be necessary, but there is insufficient evidence.",
