While some of these factors are difficult to mitigate, many are preventable. One of the key drivers of medication non-adherence in the US is the costs of prescription drugs 5 . Transplant recipients may forgo medications because of cost-related concerns, such as out-of-pocket costs and the lack of adequate prescription coverage by insurance programs. The cost of basic transplant immunosuppression in the era of generic medicine has been dramatically reduced, whereas the economic costs of graft loss, return to dialysis and subsequent re-transplantation are staggeringly high. Comprehensive economic evaluations and costing studies have shown extending immunosuppression coverage under Medicare from 36 months to the duration of the transplant survival is cost-saving and saves at least an additional 0.37 quality-adjusted life years compared to current policy 5 . For government and health care providers, a supply of basic transplant medicine is a fraction of hospitalisation and treatment of complications. The findings presented in this letter are extremely persuasive and underpin the motivation for policies that promote and mandate Medicare coverage of immunosuppressive drugs for the life of the transplanted kidney.",

Those with the poorest health are most likely to experience the worst outcomes during times of COVID-19. This pandemic should prompt all governments worldwide to look at their healthcare systems to promote better coordinated care in the event of future pandemics. This crisis will no doubt have a lasting implication on the health systems, economy and our social structure. Both Letters to the Editor highlight how a truly global pandemic such as COVID-19 should lead us to re-evaluate and re-design how we provide care. In the post COVID-19 medical world, widespread early adoption of disease testing, greater telehealth and alternative communication and personal support strategies including medication supply need to be developed worldwide to protect vulnerable people and \"future-proof\" our systems against the next crisis before it develops. This pandemic also urges us to reconsider how we value all people regardless of their backgrounds, cultures, ethnicity, and social status.",

Emerging data from the US and Europe indicated the risk of early deaths for hospitalised transplant recipients is at least 20% 1 , and these patients experienced more rapid disease progression and lower lymphocyte counts than immunocompetent patients with COVID-19 2 . For those who did not suffer from the direct and devastating impact of the disease, COVID-19 added a layer of complexity including fear, anxiety and apprehension, making it extremely difficult to care for these patients who are immunosuppressive therapy who all presented acute rejection after stopping their medications during the social distancing \"stay at home\" orders, and the dilemma's faced by these patients are global. When health authorities mandate effective social distancing and isolation as the key strategy in controlling the pandemic, this inevitably reduces patient engagement with the health system. Additional financial stress and high unemployment due to the economic impact of COVID-19 are potentially devastating on families. If the choice is to feed your children and your family or buy your medications, most will put the family first. sensitization in those with rejection thus compounding the difficulty for a subsequent transplant and thereby adding to the dialysis population. Acute rejection and loss of function due to non-adherence in deceased donor grafts is a tragedy for the donor families, who rightly should expect better care of their loved ones' organs. Non-adherence, a complex human behaviour, often considered as a taboo, has always existed before Covid-19. This global pandemic has further exposed this chronic problem, which may be driven by a combination",
