            "text": "Introduction 54 The COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread worldwide and is one of the greatest public health 55 problems in the world. The severity of the COVID-19 picture is probably due to a previous 56 deterioration of the immune system [1] due to the comorbidities, such as those reported Williamson 57 et al., [2] : cardiovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory disease including severe asthma, obesity, 58 history of hematological malignancy, cancer, kidney, liver, neurological and autoimmune 59 conditions. Many patients are symptomatic to some degree after COVID-19 Infection but 60 Pulmonary fibrosis is exceptional [3] . 61 Animal models have demonstrated how SARS CoV-2 infection in macaques [4] provides effective 62 protection against reinfection by this virus, probably due to the rapid immune control that occurs 63 thanks to the neutralizing action of the antibodies. This action is centered on its ability to neutralize 64 the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the virus in the S1 subunit, thus preventing its binding to the 65 cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and therefore avoiding the entry of the 66 virus into the cell. In addition, several studies have been carried out on the early use of plasma from 67 convalescent patients with high titers of neutralizing antibodies as a therapeutic option in patients 68 with 6] . 69 Finally, the risk of reinfection is considerable, due to several reasons: the absence of a threshold of 70 antibodies that predict protection, the permanence of these antibodies in the organism after a 71 primary infection and the emerging viral variants. 72 Our aims were to describe epidemiological characteristics, know the amount of protective 73 antibodies and their permanence after COVID-19 primary infection in patients with risk of 74 pulmonary fibrosis.",

These patients had 81 to present at least one of the following conditions to be referred to such consultation: persistence of 82 pathological alterations in the chest X-ray and/or having required special ventilatory support 83 devices during their admission (high-flow nasal spectacles, noninvasive ventilation or intubation 84 and mechanical ventilation). This follow-up ended when respiratory clinical normalization was 85 observed and complete or almost complete involution of the radiological alterations initially 86 visualized was confirmed. During follow-up and for the evaluation of possible post COVID-19 87 pulmonary sequelae pulmonary function tests and imaging tests (pulmonary ultrasound and high 88 resolution computed axial tomography) were performed at 6 weeks (in all cases) and at 3-6 months 89 and one year (those who had to be followed up due to incomplete recovery in the initial and 90 successive visits). 91 Patient volunteers signed their informed consent and were subsequently scheduled for serum 92 sampling at 4-5 months and 8-9 months after COVID-19 infection. 93 We analyzed different antibodies; RBD-specific IgG, Nucleocapsid IgG, and Spike 1-RBD IgM 94 antibodies determined by Abbott chemiluminescent microparticle assays (CMIA): SARS-CoV-2 95 IgG II Quant, SARS-CoV-2 IgG and SARS-CoV-2 IgM using the ARCHITECT i 2000 SR system, 96 following the manufacturer's instructions. 97 IgG RBD measurements were transformed to the WHO [7] international standard BAU/mL in order 98 .

However, in our study we did not find difference when the level 225 of RBD IgG according to the severity of the COVID-19 disease suffered was compared, coinciding 226 with other authors such as Sandberg et al., [17] probably because all our population had a diagnosis 227 of pneumonia and were stratified as severe or moderate COVID-19, without having patients with 228 mild or asymptomatic disease, as well as the period after the COVID-19 infection analyzed. On 229 the other hand we observed that the amount of RBD IgG antibodies is maintained throughout the 230 convalescent COVID-19 phase and that the amount that remains in the medium term seems to 231 protect against new reinfections despite of emerging viral variants. 232 Finally, we believe that the development or not of pulmonary fibrosis is probably independent of 233 the amount of RBD IgG generated, since we observed that regardless of the level of antibodies 234 maintained, a considerable proportion of COVID-19 patients developed discrete interstitial 235 parenchymal alterations. 236 There are some limitations to this study. The first one is that the sample size is small, which 237 undermines the power of the study. On the other hand, in our study the majority of patients suffered 238 a moderate-severe degree of severity of the disease, who were those who required follow-up by the 239 multidisciplinary consultation, so that the humoral immune response profile cannot be applied to 240 patients with a mild degree of severity or to asymptomatic patients. Another limitation is that even 241 if no new reinfections were detected, these may have been asymptomatic, however, these patients 242 have a greater neutralizing capacity thanks to the positivity of IgG and IgA. 243 Taking these limitations into consideration, our study describes a high percentage of mild 244 pulmonary fibrosis development in patients who presented at least one of the following conditions: 245 persistence of pathological alterations in the chest X-ray and/or having required special ventilatory 246 support devices during their admission.",
