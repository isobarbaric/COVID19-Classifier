Alcohol consumption levels in Argentina are among the highest in the world, and malignant neoplasms are the second cause of death in the country. Public health strategies aimed at reducing alcohol consumption could possibly lead to a decrease in cancer burden. Alcohol-attributable burden has been estimated before in neighboring countries Chile and Brazil. We now aimed to quantify the burden for Argentina."

We additionally explored which hypothetical scenario would achieve the highest reduction in alcohol-attributable cancer burden: 1) heavy drinkers shifting to moderate drinking or 2) moderate drinkers shifting to light drinking."

Alcohol consumption is associated in a dose-responsive manner with a higher risk for several diseases, such as several types of cancer and liver cirrhosis, as well as vehicle accidents and (un)intentional injury [2] [3] [4] [5] . On the other hand, moderate alcohol consumption is thought to have potential benefits on ischemic heart disease and diabetes [6, 7] . Therefore, most international guidelines on alcohol consumption allow for a limited consumption of alcohol but emphasize that complete abstention from alcohol remains best [8] [9] [10] . The public opinion on alcohol consumption in many countries is that it is culturally accepted as social habit, which encourages its use. Argentina is part of the region of Southern Latin America. This region has the highest per capita alcohol consumption in Latin America and consumption levels are also higher than in most other world regions [2] . Furthermore, the wine and beer industries have grown in the last decade and are very prominent in the region, particularly in some Andean provinces. Drinking is ingrained in the country's culture and has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic [11] . However, observational data on alcohol consumption, as well as estimations of impact of alcohol consumption on society, are relatively scarce in this part of the world [12] ."

This is a nationwide representative survey of 29,224 individuals aged > 18 years BMC Public Health (2022) 22:124 from the general population [25] , data are publicly available from: https:// www. indec. gob. ar/ indec/ web/ Insti tucio nal-Indec-Bases DeDat os-2. The survey contained a beverage-specific quantity-frequency questionnaire on alcohol consumption. Participants had to report their habitual weekly or, when drinking less than weekly, monthly consumption of units of beer, wine, and spirits. A standard unit in the Americas in general contains approximately 14 g of alcohol [9] . We calculated the total alcohol consumption per person in g per day. To be consistent with the consumption levels used in the metaanalysis, we categorized the participants based on their daily alcohol consumption into 1) non-drinkers, 2) light drinkers (0.1 -12.5 g/day), 3) moderate drinkers (12.6 -50 g/day), and 4) heavy drinkers (> 50 g/day). Similar categories were used for men and women. We accounted for complex survey design by using sampling weights. We presented the prevalence of the aforementioned consumption categories stratified by age (categorized into 18-29 y, 30-39, 40-49 y, 50-59 y, 60-69 y, and > 70 y) and sex."

YLLs are estimated by multiplying the estimated number of deaths by age with life expectancy at that age. We multiplied the number of deaths per age category, as derived from the vital registration data, with the life expectancy for Argentina per age category according to estimations from the World Health Organization (WHO) [27] . We derived the YLDs from the Global Health Data exchange, using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) results tool [28] , available from http:// ghdx. healt hdata. org/ gbd-resul ts-tool. Following GBD methodology, YLDs were calculated by multiplying disease prevalence by a disability weight [29] . A disability weight quantifies the severity of health loss associated with that disease, ranging on a scale from 0 (perfect health) to 1 (death) [30] . Since cancer has different phases, for which different disability weights are appropriate (e.g., the controlled phase of cancer has a lower disability weight than the terminal phase of cancer), specific disability weights were multiplied with the prevalence of each of the following four phases, or sequelae: 1) diagnosis and primary therapy phase, 2) controlled phase, 3) metastatic phase, and 4) terminal phase. Finally, YLLs and YLDs were summed to obtain DALYs, stratified by sex and age category. We calculated the number of DALYs that can be attributed to alcohol consumption by multiplying it with the PAF of alcohol."

Additionally, we explored three hypothetical scenarios to analyze which changes in alcohol consumption levels would account for the greatest reduction in alcohol-attributable cancer burden: 1) heavy drinkers become moderate drinkers, 2) moderate drinkers become light drinkers, and 3) moderate drinkers become light drinkers and heavy drinkers become moderate drinkers."

Furthermore, we used the most comprehensive meta-analysis so far on the association between alcohol consumption and various types of cancer. This research provided us with risk estimates stratified by alcohol consumption category, which allowed us to make comparisons between consumption levels. At the same time, the main limitations also stem from the underlying data sources: the meta-analysis considered alcohol consumption between 12.6 and 50 g/day moderate drinking for both men and women, while the most recent alcohol consumption guidelines consider everyone who drinks > 2 units (= 28 g, in men) or > 1 unit (= 14 g, in women) daily a heavy drinker [9] . Therefore, this moderate drinking category in fact partly consists of heavy drinkers, which causes an overestimation of alcohol-attributable cancer burden for true moderate drinkers. However, since there exists a linear, dose-response, relationship between amount of alcohol consumed and risk of cancer, it is likely that shifting from moderate to light drinking still would cause a great reduction in disease burden [34] . Moreover, the limited number of women in the heavy drinking category (> 50 g/day) might have affected the precision of the risk estimates for heavy drinking, leading to non-significant associations in for example colorectal and larynx cancer. This might have led to an underestimation of the total alcohol-attributable cancer burden in women. Finally, the meta-analysis did not provide risk estimates for binge drinking, which also might have led to an underestimation of alcoholattributable cancer burden."

Alcohol consumption levels have decreased in Argentina over the yearsfrom over 15 L of annual pure alcohol consumption per capita in 1980 to around 9 L at present [2]-and we did not account for the higher levels of alcohol consumption in the past.

Overall, alcohol caused 2.3% of all cancer deaths in the year 2018. This is slightly lower than in the neighboring countries Chile [21] and Brazil [22] (respectively 3.1 and 4.5%), while similar methodology was used. We cannot entirely explain this difference, although differences in distribution of consumption levels in the population could be one of the reasons (e.g., in the Brazilian study, 25% of the male participants was heavy drinker).

            "text": "In previous research, alcohol-attributable burden of ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke in Argentina has been calculated. The beneficial effects of moderate alcohol consumption on IHD slightly outweighed the harmful effects of any alcohol consumption on stroke and of binge drinking on both disease categories: in 2011 there was a net benefit of overall saving of 488 deaths and 33,551 DALYs [35] . The present study reports detrimental effects only of alcohol consumption on risk of cancer, and therefore the burden of disease caused by alcohol becomes greater than the burden of disease prevented by alcohol. This is still an underestimation, since GBD data showed that globally, when considering all other diseases, road accidents, and other (un)intentional injury, alcoholattributable burden of disease is much higher: according to GBD data 6% of all deaths in Argentina are attributable to alcohol consumption [1] . We can therefore conclude that the potential benefits of moderate alcohol consumption on disease burden are very limited compared to the overall harmful contribution of alcohol to total burden of disease. Despite a lower relative risk of cancer in the moderate as compared to the heavy alcohol consumption category, most deaths and DALYs were attributable to moderate drinking since there are far more moderate than heavy drinkers in the population. When heavy drinkers would shift to moderate drinking, 24% of alcohol-attributable cancer deaths and DALY's would be prevented. However, if moderate drinkers would shift to light drinking, this percentage would be 46%: almost half of all alcoholattributable deaths and DALYs. This is the prevention paradox, which states that the greatest disease burden in the population is caused by the group at low-to-moderate risk and not by the group at high risk, because the lowto-moderate risk group is much larger in absolute number [23] . We do not assume the modelled scenarios to be realistic in the sense that all heavy drinkers would shift to moderate drinking, or all moderate drinkers would shift to light drinking following alcohol policy measures. We however do think that, in terms of public health policy, a population-wide strategy aimed to shift the population distribution of alcohol consumption levels would be more effective in reducing alcohol-related harm than targeting high-risk drinkers only [34] . Recently, the WHO has launched the global SAFER initiative [5] , that provides five population-wide strategies (\"best buys\") to reduce the harmful use of alcohol in the population, including: reducing availability of alcohol, increased taxation on alcohol-containing products, restrictions on alcohol advertising and promotion, better access to screening and brief interventions, and stricter legislation to prevent drink-driving. Implementation of such strategies on a public health level is known to be challenging, since it always involves several other players (political, economic) with conflicting interests [36] . Although in Argentina specific regulation exists (National Law No. 24,788), the norm is not sufficient for an effective control of the consumption of alcoholic beverages in the adolescent population since it does not comply with the international standards. Argentina already has implemented some of the SAFER measures in the past recent years but could certainly benefit from additional strategies to further reduce overall consumption of alcohol."

            "text": "Alcohol consumption accounted for 2.3% of all cancer deaths and 2.1% of all cancer DALYs in Argentina in 2018. Most deaths and DALYs were attributable to moderate alcohol consumption, since heavy drinkers only make up for a small proportion of the population. This calls for implementation of population-wide strategies to reduce harmful use of alcohol in the general population and its impact on the total burden of disease."
