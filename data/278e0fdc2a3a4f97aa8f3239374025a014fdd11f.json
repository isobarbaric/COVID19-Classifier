MG produces a variety of metabolites that cause dysfunction of the respiratory mucosal epithelial cells. It can also migrate to the lungs and air sacs, leading to lung and balloon lesions, resulting in effusion [3, 4] . Typical symptoms of MG infection are severe weight loss, coughing, runny nose, and a vocal sound when breathing, with a slow and long course [5] . The disease can decrease the growth rate of the chicken and the conversion rate of the feed to bring huge economic loss to poultry farming [6] [7] [8] .",

Species annotations to the representative sequence of OTU with GreenGenes 13_8 database to obtain a relative abundance of the phylum level. It is shown here that at least a phylum that has a relative abundance in a sample is greater than 1%.

The inhibitory efficiency gradually strengthened following the increased drug concentration when danofloxacin concentrations were higher than MIC (2 \u03bcg/mL). During 0-12 h, the danofloxacin concentration in the lung was higher than in the plasma. It revealed that danofloxacin had good distribution in the lung tissue and was suitable for pulmonary infections. At each time point, the danofloxacin concentration of the infected group was higher than that of the healthy group, which indicated that the disease had an impact on the distribution of the danofloxacin. The killing-time curves revealed that the antibacterial effect of danofloxacin against MG was concentration-dependent. The best PK-PD parameter for danofloxacin was the Area Under Curve/Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (AUC/MIC). ",

A significant difference (increased) was observed for Proteobacteria for the post-treatment group. Bacteroidetes was no obvious change among the four groups. From the perspective of bacteriological classification, MG belongs to Firmicutes. The number of Firmicutes decreased with the MG infected group because there may be competition for the growth between MG and other Firmicutes. It decreased MG and recovery for the other Firmicutes with the danofloxacin treatment group. Firmicutes reached a similar level with the normal state after cure. Bacteroides have no noticeable change for the four groups since danofloxacin is more effective for treating Gram-positive bacteria, Mycoplasma, and some anaerobic bacteria. However, Bacteroides belongs to Gram-negative bacteria. As for the decrease of Proteobacteria after the challenge with MG and the recovery after treatment with danofloxacin, there was some evidence that danofloxacin is more effective for E. coli [43] and Salmonella [44] , which belong to the Proteobacteria.

A significant difference (increased) was observed for Proteobacteria for post-treatment group. Bacteroidetes was no obvious change among the four groups. F the perspective of bacteriological classification, MG belongs to Firmicutes. The numb Firmicutes decreased with the MG infected group because there may be competition the growth between MG and other Firmicutes. It decreased MG and recovery for the o Firmicutes with the danofloxacin treatment group. Firmicutes reached a similar level the normal state after cure. Bacteroides have no noticeable change for the four groups s danofloxacin is more effective for treating Gram-positive bacteria, Mycoplasma, and s anaerobic bacteria. However, Bacteroides belongs to Gram-negative bacteria. As for th crease of Proteobacteria after the challenge with MG and the recovery after treatment danofloxacin, there was some evidence that danofloxacin is more effective for E. coli and Salmonella [44] , which belong to the Proteobacteria. To identify the common and unique OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) among different samples, the Venn diagrams were generated to make qualitative comparisons of the common OTUs between groups and the unique OTUs for each group (Figure 6 ). Representative sequences for each OTU were retrieved and classified to the genus level. There were 3584, 2894, 2852, and 2382 OTUs detected in the HWK (control group), GW (infection group), ZW (treatment group), and ZHW (post-treatment group) group, respectively.

For immunization, inactivated, live attenuated and recombinant vaccines are commercially available for MG [47] . Antibiotics that inhibit the metabolic processes of microorganisms, especially fluoroquinoles, are commonly used to treat the infection [48] . Reasonable treatment is recommended to control CRD caused by MG to minimize their economic losses. Although antimicrobials should be used prudently to slow the emergence of resistance, little research has been performed to establish the ECVs, CO PD , and CO CL of antibacterial agents against MG.

The selection of PK-PD parameters have been reported in the literature.",

Zhang et al. [11] reported the PK-PD relationship of danofloxacin to MG in the in vivo infection model by the PK-PD parameter AUC/MIC.

Because danofloxacin can be accumulated at the infection site (lung), the CO PD in plasma may not represent the significant parameters of the lung. The pharmacokinetic studies of danofloxacin on chickens are relatively few. Zhang et al. [70] reported that the C max , T max , and AUC 24 of danofloxacin in lung tissues at a dose of 5 mg/kg b.w. in MG infected chickens was 1.14 \u00b1 0.15 \u00b5g/mL, 2.67 \u00b1 1.15 h, and 10.26 \u00b1 2.42 \u00b5g\u00b7h/mL, respectively. It is different from the C max (4.71 \u00b1 0.29 \u00b5g/mL), T max (1.30 \u00b1 0.01 h), and AUC 24 (23.67 \u00b1 2.24 \u00b5g\u00b7h/mL) in our study. The differences in PK parameters among different studies may be due to differences in chicken breeds, and individual differences in experimental animals are also important reasons. Danofloxacin easily penetrates the tissue, so the drug concentration of danofloxacin in lung tissue was higher than that in plasma [11] . The C max could be reached in plasma and lung tissue for about 1 h following oral administration, indicating that danofloxacin absorbs rapidly in plasma and lung tissue. The infected groups had a higher drug concentration distribution at the target site, showing that danofloxacin is suitable for the treatment of deep tissue diseases [71] .",

This study used a previously reported method [72] to establish a real-time PCR method to detect changes in the copy number of MG in clinical trials, with the detection limit of 158 copies, which was 1000 times more sensitive than a regular PCR method. With the increase of the infection time, the bacteria increasingly colonize the chickens, which is consistent with the changes in the clinical symptoms of the chickens. The trial results showed that the effective rate and cure rate of the M2 and M24 strains were more than 90%, because the strains were sensitive, and the drug had a better therapeutic effect. The effective rate and cure rate of the M57 strain drug treatment group were low. The possible reason for this is that M57 may contain acquired resistance genes or other resistance mechanisms, and requires further study.",

The results suggest that the number of lung microbiota decreased gradually in the trial period, but there was no significant difference between the MG infected group and the treatment group. The OTU Venn diagram shows that the control group has the highest unique flora, and with a huge decrease in the infection group, the unique flora reached the minimum value with the treatment of danofloxacin.

Some dysregulation is only an abnormal change in quantity and generally has no clinical manifestations or only mild adverse reactions, which can be recovered naturally after drug withdrawal. However, antibiotics that were trialed by oral administration could affect autoimmunity by affecting gut microbiota colonization. Wang et al. [84] studied the correlation between gut microbiota and MG infection by disturbing gut microbiota in chickens with an antibiotic cocktail. The results showed that gut microbiota dysbiosis impairs pulmonary immune response against MG infection. The studies above have shown that antibiotics are a double-edged sword, so more attention should be paid to the rational use of drugs.",

The ECV value was higher than CO PD and CO CL , indicating that certain MG isolates may resist danofloxacin. The ECV, CO PD , and CO CL values could be considered preliminary cutoff values. According to the CLSI M37-A3 decision tree ( Figure S11 ), danofloxacin's final clinical breakpoint (CBP) against MG is 1 \u00b5g/mL. These results provide a standard and reference for the use of danofloxacin in the treatment of MG. In addition, the therapeutic regimen obtained from PK-PD model is 16.60 mg/kg b.w. with a 24-h interval oral administered for three days. The research shows that the effect of drug treatment on lung microbiota should be considered when one therapeutic drug is needed.",
