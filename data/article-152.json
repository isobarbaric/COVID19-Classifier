            "text": "Prostate abscesses often occur in immunocompromised individuals. Contrast-enhanced imaging tests can aid diagnosis; however, they can be difficult to perform in older patients with renal insufficiency. Various organisms can cause prostate abscesses, and poor antibiotic penetration into the prostate can hinder treatment. Here, we report a case of prostate abscess manifesting as fever of unknown origin. The patient, a 78-year-old man with a history of heart failure, renal failure, and liver cirrhosis, presented with dyspnea and fever. He was initially diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. However, the fever persisted, and urinary tract infection was diagnosed and treated with antibiotics and antifungal drugs. Further investigation with contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a prostate abscess. This case demonstrates the importance of aggressive investigation of fever of unknown origin in older patients with renal insufficiency. Furthermore, the problem of tissue penetration of antimicrobial agents should be thoroughly considered when treating prostate abscesses."

The most common causative organisms are Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, which usually cause urinary tract infection (UTI) [1] . Men do not frequently experience UTIs; however, the presence of a UTI prompts further investigation because it is generally complicated in men. Moreover, in immunocompromised individuals, organisms can colonize the urinary bladder, causing UTI and prostate abscess [2] . Therefore, prostate abscesses should be considered a cause of symptoms of infection in immunocompromised men."

The prostate of immunocompromised patients can be infected by both bacteria and fungi, and it is difficult for low doses of antifungal drugs to penetrate the prostate [7, 8] .

Antibiotics do not penetrate well into the prostate [7] . Furthermore, the penetration of antifungal drugs into the prostate may be lower than that of antibiotics [7] . Abscess formation can further decrease the rate of penetration of antibiotics into the prostate [15] . In this case, PIPC/TAZ and fluconazole were used. In vitro studies revealed low penetration rates for these drugs. The rate of penetration of 13.5 g/day of PIPC/TAZ into the prostate is 50%; however, there are no data on patients with renal failure [16] . The rate of penetration of fluconazole into the prostate is approximately 3%; therefore, it can be challenging to treat fungal infections of the prostate through medical management alone [7] . These issues should be considered when treating patients with prostate abscesses."

In this case, antifungal drugs and antibiotics were administered; however, because of low penetration into the prostate, the patient's condition worsened. The patient's immunocompromised state could have affected the pathophysiology [12] . In addition to a history of liver cirrhosis and renal failure, the patient had white nails, which is a predictor of mortality in admitted patients [17, 18] . Therefore, the patient's immunocompromised state might have facilitated the dissemination of Candida into the prostate [19] . As the penetration of antibiotics into the prostate can be low, the abscess should be quickly aspirated, and sufficient antibiotics and antifungal drugs should be promptly administered after diagnosis using contrastenhanced imaging tests [20] ."
