Using latent class analysis, we compared patterns of disagreement with claims about (a) the origin, spread, or infectiousness of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and (b) the personal risk from COVID-19 between scientific laypersons (N = 1,575) and scientific experts (N = 128). Two groups in the general public differed distinctively from expert evaluations. The Dismissive (8%) are characterized by lowrisk assessment, low compliance with containment measures, and mistrust in politicians. The Doubtful (19%) are characterized by low cognitive reflection, high uncertainty in the distinction between true and false claims, and high social media intake. Our research indicates that pandemic denial cannot be linked to a single and distinct pattern of psychological dispositions but involves different subgroups within the general population that share high COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and low beliefs in epistemic complexity.",

Due to the novelty of the virus, its fatal threat, and the speed of the pandemic development, there has been an enormous exchange of information, especially in the initial phase of the pandemic. In February 2020, the World Health Organization (2020: 13) had characterized the COVID-19 information landscape as an infodemic, \"an overabundance of information-some accurate and some not-that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it . . .\". A public health concern related to this infodemic was that laypersons would trust in unreliable sources instead of scientific advice and, thus, not follow containment measures. Lack of compliance with these measures increases their own risk of infection but also the risk of other members of society, thereby jeopardizing the general public health plan directed toward the goal of flattening the curve of infections (e.g. Thunstrom et al., 2020) . This public health concern is based on the rise of science denial, a pattern of beliefs that involves the refusal of established scientific evidence in a specific field of research (e.g. Bj\u00f6rnberg et al., 2017) . Science denial has been identified and investigated in various areas of scientific research, for example, climate change denial Hansson, 2017) .",

We analyzed its prevalence, distinguished between different patterns of denial, and investigated its associations with containment behavior and conspiratorial thinking during Germany's first wave of COVID-19. Second, to better understand the psychological underpinnings of pandemic denial, we investigated demographics, political beliefs, media use, and personality dispositions as predictors of pandemic denial.",

This phenomenon of science denial can include different forms of communicative behaviors, such as the misrepresentation of the work of scientists, reliance on fake experts, selectivity in picking scientific evidence, or the dismissal of a scientific consensus (Sinatra and Hofer, 2021; Van der Linden, 2019) . Some scholars conceptualize science denial in the broader context of a general crisis of expertise (Eyal, 2019) or even diagnosed an age of post-truthism (Kienhues et al., 2020) . Both accounts describe an increasing tendency of influential communicators such as politicians, media agencies, or industrial companies to systematically distort scientific evidence by capitalizing on the inherent intricacies of the scientific endeavor. In regard to climate change, Dunlap (2013) suggested the term \"denial machine\" to describe how lobbying and propaganda are strategically used to discredit scientific evidence by influential interest groups in the United States. These communicative strategies are likely to generate and enhance science denial in those parts of the general public that are especially vulnerable to this form of communication based on individual-level, group-level, or intergroup level-processes (for an overview, see Prot and Anderson, 2019) .",

(2010) distinguished six segments in the American public based on their climate change beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. Since the state of scientific evidence is challenging to assess at any given point in time, expert surveys have been used to estimate the state of evidence-based professional evaluations (e.g. Horton et al., 2020) . We aim to combine both approaches to better understand systematic patterns of discrepancy between scientific laypersons and expert scientists.",

Hansson and Aven (2014) provided a fine-grained process model for the information flow when scientific evidence is used as a base for decision-making on risks. They distinguished between the provision of evidence by scientific experts and the risk assessment by decision-makers (i.e. laypersons). Personal knowledge about the state of scientific evidence is regarded as a precondition for risk assessment (for a similar argument in the context of climate change, see Van der Linden et al., 2015) . However, risk assessment is also influenced by personal values, motivational states, and levels of risk tolerance on the side of individuals (Slovic, 1999) . In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, Aven and Bouder (2020) emphasized the distinction between professional risk judgment and individual risk perception and suggested that these differences are not well acknowledged in public communication about the pandemic. In order to better understand different forms of pandemic denial, we investigate patterns of discrepancy in (a) technical claims about virus infection and the development of the pandemic and (b) perceived risks related to how COVID-19 impacts human life.",

Conspiratorial thinking generally reflects notions that events are caused by the malevolent actions of influential groups working together in secret (Brotherton et al., 2013; Douglas et al., 2017; Van der Linden et al., 2021) . Misinformation about COVID-19 is often embedded in conspiratorial narratives that distort knowledge about the scientific evidence and risk assessment and undermine compliance with containment measures (Cavojova et al., 2020; Erceg et al., 2020; Imhoff and Lamberty, 2020; Teovanovi\u0107 et al., 2021; Uscinski et al., 2020) .

Conspiratorial thinking is linked to low cognitive capacity (St\u00e5hl and van Prooijen, 2018) and low motivation to think analytically (Douglas et al., 2017; Swami et al., 2014) . Based on dual-process models such as the elaboration-likelihood model (Petty and Cacioppo, 1986) or the heuristic-systematic model (Chen and Chaiken, 1999) , we argue that people with these cognitive dispositions find it especially challenging to tolerate the rate at which scientific evidence about COVID-19 develops dynamically (i.e. the state of evidence is constantly changing). Therefore, it seems plausible to assume that cognitive dispositions are related to pandemic denial. Preliminary support for this assumption comes from research showing that uncertainty avoidance and low cognitive reflection are linked to believing in COVID-19 conspiracies (Alper et al., 2020; Pennycook et al., 2020a) .",

It suggests that people leaning toward the political right tend to deny scientific evidence that potentially threatens the political and societal status quo (e.g. Feygina et al., 2010) . Recent studies support this claim by indicating that people on the political right are generally more inclined to reject scientific advice compared with people on the political left Kerr and Wilson, 2021; Lewandowsky and Oberauer, 2021) . In the United States, Conservatives are more inclined to downplay the risk of COVID-19 and less compliant with physical distancing measures (Grossman et al., 2020; Rosenfeld et al., 2020) . For example, based on county-level Google Mobility Reports data, and census-based demographic data, Lipsitz and Pop-Eleches (2020) showed that individuals in Democratic states of the United States displayed significantly lower activity during the pandemic than individuals in Republican counties. However, these cross-ideological differences might be stronger in the United States compared with other countries Pickup et al., 2020) .

Social media play a crucial role in providing information about COVID-19 (Cinelli et al., 2020; Mohd Hanafiah and Wan, 2020; Moreno et al., 2020; Thelwall and Thelwall, 2020) . Public health concerns are derived from the finding that misinformation spreads easily through social media platforms (Vosoughi et al., 2018) . In a network analysis, Vel\u00e1squez and colleagues (2020) outlined how misinformation and malicious content about COVID-19 made their way from niche, often right-wing extremist platforms to popular social media. In line with the two-step flow of communication hypothesis (Katz and Lazarsfeld, 1955/1966) , opinion leaders and influential communicators are vital in sharing evidence-based content with the general public. Pennycook and colleagues (2020b) found evidence for unintended sharing of false information about COVID-19 because they believe them to be true. In a Malaysian study conducted shortly after the national policy to restrict public movement of 18 March 2020, respondents indicated receiving a lot of questionable information or disinformation about COVID-19 through social media or friends and family (Mohd Hanafiah and Wan, 2020). Another study from the United States indicates that people using social media and conservative media formats as their main source of information on COVID-19 have a less accurate picture about the diseases' dangers and protection measures than people receiving their information mainly from mainstream broadcast and print media (Jamieson and Albarracin, 2020) . Bridgman and colleagues (2020) found that exposure to social media is associated with misperceptions about COVID-19 leading to lower compliance with social distancing measures. We investigated whether the use of social media as a source of information about COVID-19 is linked to pandemic denial in the German population.",

This point in time marked the end of a first wave of infections in Germany that came with a series of political countermeasures, including a travel ban, a lockdown of shops and schools, and a restriction of interpersonal contacts. It also marked the beginning of a strong protest movement (Querdenker 711) against COVID-19 containment measures that was characterized by pandemic denial and organized in a number of demonstrations over the course of summer and fall 2020 (e.g. Conolly, 2020) .

By using a person-centered analytical approach, we were able to investigate distinct patterns of consensus and disagreement between the general public and scientific experts on technical claims and risk assessments about COVID-19 and the current pandemic. We investigated the relations of pandemic denial with containment behavior and conspiracy beliefs as a means to evaluate the construct validity of our pandemic denial measure in different segments of the population. The second goal of this research was to investigate demographics, political beliefs, media use, and personality dispositions as predictors of pandemic denial. We were especially focusing on (a) cognitive reflection and style, (b) political identity and alignment, and (c) exposure to misinformation in social media. By doing so, we aimed to better understand the cognitive and motivational underpinnings of pandemic denial.",

We calculated 10 alternative LCA models (a 1-class model through to a 10-class model). The relative fit of the models was compared using different criteria. We used Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC; Schwarz, 1978) because simulation studies suggest that the BIC value is a good information criterion for identifying the number of latent classes (Nylund et al., 2007) . Furthermore, we calculated the integrated completed likelihood-BIC (ICL-BIC) because BIC tends to overestimate the amount of classes and ICL is more robust toward violations of some of the mixture model assumptions (Biernacki et al., 2000) . We also examined the size of the smallest class. There are two reasons for considering class size for model selection. From a statistical perspective, classes with a small number of participants may restrict power and precision (Lubke and Neale, 2006) . From a theoretical perspective, classes smaller than a given threshold (e.g. 5%) may not be relevant on a societal level. The fit statistics for the LCAs are presented in the Supplemental Materials. BIC (eight classes), ICL-BIC (two or three classes), and size of the smallest class (not more than five classes) do not converge in the estimation of the best class solution. After examination of the response patterns in different classes, we chose a four-class solution because it provided the best relation between Table 2 . Means, standard deviations, and mean differences of the general public, the latent classes and the expert sample. parsimony of the number of classes and information value in terms of discrimination between the different response patterns.

We find two distinct groups: the Dismissive (8 %) and the Doubtful (19%). Both groups report lower belief in epistemic complexity and are generally more inclined to consider COVID-19 conspiracies than the rest of our sample. This finding supports the notion that scientific reasoning and conspiratorial thinking might function as predominant and antagonist analytic perspectives in the current pandemic (Miller, 2020) . Both groups express higher levels of collective narcissism and are more likely to report a rightwing political ideology. This finding is in line with the notion that pandemic denial might be, at least in part, motivated by a perceived threat to political identity (Sternisko et al., 2020) and motivated cognition linked to political conservatism (e.g. Jost et al., 2003) . However, there are also significant differences between both groups. Pandemic denial in the Dismissive (8%) is characterized especially by low-risk assessment, low perception of personal vulnerability to infection, and low compliance with containment measures. This group of people reports a significant amount of mistrust not only toward scientists but also toward politicians. We interpret these findings as evidence that the Dismissive provide the most serious threat for a general public health plan directed toward the goal of flattening the curve of infections because (a) their compliance with COVID-19 containment measures is strongly reduced and (b) they are likely to be exceptionally resistant toward scientific reasoning about the pandemic due to low risk-assessment and general anti-elitist sentiments. During the pandemic, scientists, politicians, and other key stakeholders (e.g. journalists and newsmakers) cooperate toward the containment of the virus. This cooperation can lead to a spillover effect in the sense that anti-elitist sentiments toward politicians are extended toward other stakeholders within society such as journalists (Kr\u00e4mer, 2014) and scientists (Mede and Sch\u00e4fer, 2020). From the perspective of science communication, it might be especially difficult to engage with this segment of the population.",

When evaluating claims about COVID-19, they are similarly likely to be uncertain about (a) their risk assessment, (b) technical claims that experts perceive to be true, and (c) technical claims that experts perceive to be false. As the Doubtful displayed lower levels of formal education and cognitive reflection, the challenge to keep up with the constantly evolving nature of scientific evidence about COVID-19 likely helped to shape their uncertainty. In terms of media use, they are more likely to receive information from social media and messengers and, thus, are more susceptible to \"alternative\" facts and perspectives from influential communicators. The combination of low cognitive reflection and a strong need for simple answers could make this group of people drawn toward conspiratorial thinking. This interpretation is in line with evidence indicating that irrational beliefs can serve as a buffer against uncertainty (Kay et al., 2010) .

We found empirical evidence for relations of pandemic denial with different predictors, namely, cognitive capacity and style, political alignments and identities, and media use. Future research should investigate the interplay between these different accounts to uncover psychological processes and dynamics in more detail. Our findings also indicate that different groups of individuals are likely to be motivated by different psychological processes. In line with this finding, we argue for conceptualizing pandemic denial as the result of a communication process between at least two groups: a small group of self-confident and politically motivated people who tend to dismiss the risk from infection and a larger group with a high need for simple answers which tends to perceive information from social media as accurate. Investigating the communication dynamics between these two groups is likely to provide critical insights into how science communication can address conspiratorial thinking as a counternarrative to scientific reasoning (see also Schmid and Betsch, 2019) .",

This finding is in line with research indicating that trust in science is generally high in Germany and that it might even have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic (Wissenschaft im Dialog & Kantar, 2020). From a methodological perspective, our study complements and extends this research. We assessed the general evaluation of trust in scientists and the actual accordance in evaluations between scientific experts and scientific laypeople. Our study suggests that a substantial amount of the general public did (a) process scientific evidence adequately and (b) construe risk assessment similar to scientists. This finding indicates that the communication of scientific evidence through mass media did reach and convince the majority of the general public in Germany during the initial phase of the pandemic in spring 2020. We also find evidence that compliance with containment measures is generally higher among this majority than in the rest of the sample. This finding provides correlational evidence for the assumption that knowledge of the scientific evidence and risk assessment translates into protective behavior (Hansson and Aven, 2014) .",

Between the middle of April and the beginning of May 2020, cases of infection dropped substantially, the goal of flattening the curve was achieved, and many lockdown laws were relaxed. Therefore, this is a good point of time for drawing intermediate conclusions about how the general public perceived and evaluated claims about COVID-19 in Germany. It would be interesting to compare our results with evidence from other countries with similar and different trajectories concerning the containment of the pandemic.",
