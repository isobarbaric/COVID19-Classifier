In April 2020, sacituzumab govitecan received accelerated approval in the USA for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who have received at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease. Sacituzumab govitecan is undergoing phase III development for breast cancer in the USA and EU, and phase II development for urothelial cancer. It is also being explored for brain metastases, glioblastoma, endometrial cancer and prostate cancer. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of sacituzumab govitecan leading to this first approval for mTNBC.",

Sacituzumab govitecan was developed by site-specific conjugation of the irinotecan active metabolite, SN-38 (govitecan), to a humanized monoclonal antibody (hRS7) against trophoblastic cell-surface antigen-2 (Trop-2); SN-38 is covalently linked to hRS7 via a hydrolysable CL2A linker [2] [3] [4] [5] . Trop-2 is overexpressed in many solid tumours [3, 4] and has limited expression in normal tissues [6] . Trop-2 plays a role in oncogenesis and is associated with poor prognosis of several cancers, including breast cancer [7] . SN-38 is a moderately-toxic topoisomerase I inhibitor and therefore is conjugated to hRS7 at a high mean drug-to-antibody ratio (7.6) [3] . Use of a less toxic drug may improve therapeutic index of the formulation.",

Neutropenia was the most common dose-limiting toxicity and it was not correlated with serum govitecan levels or UGT1A1 genotype. The safety profile of sacituzumab govitecan was generally predictable and manageable [34] . Among 108 patients with mTNBC receiving sacituzumab govitecan in IMMU-132-01, grade 3 AEs occurred in 66% of patients; the most common (incidence \u2265 5%) were neutropenia (26%), anaemia (11%), hypophosphatemia (9%), WBC decrease (8%), diarrhoea (8%), nausea (6%) and vomiting (6%) [36] . Grade 4 AEs occurred in 19% of patients and included neutropenia (16%) and WBC decrease (3%) [36] . Serious adverse reactions occurred in 31% of patients and the most common (incidence > 1%) were febrile neutropenia (6%) vomiting (5%), nausea (3%), dyspnoea (3%), diarrhoea (4%), anaemia (2%), pleural effusion (2%), neutropenia (2%), pneumonia (2%) and dehydration (2%) [8] . Adverse reactions led to treatment interruption in 45% of patients, most commonly due to neutropenia (33%) [8] . Two patients discontinued treatment because of treatment-related AEs [36] . Patients had received a mean 9.6 cycles of sacituzumab govitecan over a median 5.1 months [36] .",
