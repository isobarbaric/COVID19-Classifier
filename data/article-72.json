            "text": "Background To analyse a medical accident, much time and experience are needed. However, people without experience in analysis have difficulty understanding its conditions and methods, and as a result it takes longer to establish countermeasures. It must be noted that understanding conditions by simply aligning occurrences in the accident in a chronological order is difficult. Purpose A workflow chart that considers time was proposed so that individuals without adequate experience in analysis could easily carry out root cause analysis. Methods In the 'workflow chart (WFC)', the time sequence was described horizontally. On the vertical axis, the business manual, the occurrence of the accident, and the time of the occurrence are displayed. In the bottom column of patient event, information regarding damage to patients was written in accordance with time axis. Regarding the degree of damage, the time of error until the accident was identified was connected using a straight line (when the patient was not affected, a dotted line was used) in order to show the overall picture of the accident. Results According to the time flow chart, hints to identify potential risks were proposed. Focus was placed not only on the error event, but also on keywords such as manual inadequacy, time gap, degree of error and so on to easily lead to the question 'why?' To visualise this, I proposed an operation flow chart. By using time-WFC, even beginners can easily develop accident countermeasure strategies. Conclusion Using a WFC that considers time, time of error and the occurrence of accident could be visualised. As a result, even individuals without experience in analysis could easily perform an analysis."

Identifying the primary cause and constructing a recurrence prevention system 3 to prevent human error in medical care are essential. Hence, some industrial accident analysis methods, such as 'critical incident analysis 4 ' and 'naturalistic decision making 5 ', were introduced to the healthcare industry. Lately, the Veterans Affairs root cause analysis (RCA) 6 7 has been used in many hospitals. However, medical staff at many medical sites are busy with operations and do not have sufficient time to construct recurrence prevention measures. Therefore, we (beginners with less than 5 years of experience) have been required to quickly find methods to construct proposals for accident countermeasures."

RCA was first introduced to the medical field by general companies and the airline industry and was not originally used in the healthcare industry. The purpose of RCA is to identify and solve problems and prevent recurrence. [7] [8] [9] One problem of RCA is its lack of ability to determine potential risks of a single cause of an accident abstracted by simple event enumeration. Consequently, to effectively analyse errors, an expert accident inspector skilled in systems thinking, human factors and recognition is required. However, such experts are quite few in the medical industry, and many companies work with teams of beginners, who are not experts."

In addition, cases due to inexperience or lack of knowledge were passed on to the Committee of Education. Cases of 'noncompliance' were divided into two patterns: cases where operations which were supposed to be carried out were not understood and were passed on to the Committee of Education; and cases where despite understanding the operations these were not carried out and were handled by the committee as 'not followed'. For cases considered as 'cases due to negligence', which occurred despite sufficient knowledge and skills and compliance of procedures, the medical staff were held responsible. These cases were also handled by the committee. This also applied to misrecognition (or careless misses). Based on an analysis of the behavioural characteristics of the medical staff, a decrease in the number of accidents was considered to be possible by reducing misreading of directions, incorrect number or word recognition. To address insufficiencies in the medical personnel, it was necessary to re-educate the staff and transfer them to a different department, which was reported to the higher officials as well."

By quickly identifying errors, patients could be helped well in time in some cases. However, in other cases, even if the errors were quickly identified, the medical staff still would not be able to help the patients. If the operation manual can appropriately respond to the current system, it may be possible to help some patients. By adding these to RCA, an outline of accidents could be understood more easily."

Error was discovered before the effect on the patient was noticed, for example a contrast agent administered due to misrecognition of a patient or an accident involving a pacemaker during an MRI examination. \u25ba In the momentary risk pattern, collapse or falls were mentioned.

Only when convinced that all members understand can this be determined as the final version. Since this is a committee, it may not be accepted at the site. Consequently, a trial period (2-3 weeks) should be set. If the on-site medical staff approves, it would not be a problem. However, if the staff does not approve, reconsideration will be needed. Especially when an increase in labour volume is indicated, revision of the plan and reduction of the current operations should be considered. One should note that, in such a case, a new system may be introduced (after the introduction of the countermeasure plan) or changes to the manual may be considered. Even if an old operations manual is continued to be used as is, the possibility of another accident not occurring cannot be guaranteed."

A week later, six residents, five care workers and three nurses were also found to be infected. \u25ba Report from infected persons. 15 -\"I was wearing a mask, but the residents said they could not hear me, so I removed my mask.\" -\"During the interview with the residents, they said they could not hear me, so conversation was carried out in close contact.\" -\"Conversation time exceeded to 30 minutes (conversation with the elderlies can be long).\" -\"When I was washing my hands, someone called me, and I stopped washing my hands.\" -\"Cleaning with an antiseptic solution was carried out on the elevator buttons, stair handrails, furniture, and fixtures. However, electrical appliances, such as computers, tablets, remote controllers, etc., were not cleaned.\" \u25ba Results of analysis and future recommendations. According to T-WFC, the reason why the disease spread even though operations were carried out according to Open access the infection manual is that the infection manual was not detailed enough. The manual did not serve its purpose because the medical staff had safety bias, thinking that they would not be infected. The reasons and countermeasures are presented in the following:"

The interview rooms should also be well ventilated. Distance during an interview was set at 2 m or more and for less than 15 min. For residents who cannot hear well, a face shield can be used or a simple movable partition (such as a cardboard box, cutting out the centre and replacing it with plastic)."
