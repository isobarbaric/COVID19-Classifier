Bold decisions were made to order vaccines early, before we knew if they would be effective, and to vary from the manufacturers' recommendations by extending the 'prime-boost' interval between the first and second doses of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. These decisions were controversial at the time but have contributed enormously to the effectiveness of the vaccination programme. This is a personal perspective on the approach to COVID-19 vaccination in the United Kingdom."

Over the following weeks, it became apparent that this was to be a pandemic, causing deaths and illness across the world. 3, 4 There was no effective treatment for it.

Some work had been conducted on developing a vaccine for related viruses, yet no vaccine had been developed for 'the common cold', caused by about four coronaviruses. Many people thought \"If we can't make a vaccine against the coronaviruses that cause the common cold, it must be because it's too difficult, so how will be able to make one against The reality is that, although colds cause a reduction in productivity and a considerable number of working days lost, the actual illness is relatively minor. Colds are caused by several antigenically distinct strains of coronavirus (as well as several other adenoviruses and other viruses) and each would need a different vaccine, so it would be complex and expensive; the burden of disease does not justify the investment required or the costs of immunisation and therefore a common cold coronavirus vaccine was never produced."

Some used very familiar technologies, such as Sinopharm's inactivated virus vaccine. 18 Others used technology platforms that had not previously been used for mass vaccination programmes, such as DNA, RNA and vector vaccines. Soon, there were over 135 vaccines in development. 19 A very brave decision was made somewhere in Whitehall and the UK government pledged to support the development of vaccines by committing to purchasing vaccines extremely early in their development before we knew if they would work."

Normally you spend lots of time waiting at traffic lights, but when you have a police escort, you can take the same journey and get to the same place, just as safely, but faster\". 22 The high rates of disease, whilst devastating, had a silver lining for vaccine developers. To test a vaccine, you need to accumulate enough cases in the trial participants in order to be able to compare the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. The high rates of disease during the phase III study periods meant that it took less time than was originally anticipated to accumulate enough infections in study participants, reducing the duration of the trials. Some phase III trials were reported towards the end of 2020. [23] [24] [25] We have so far been pleasantly surprised: all the vaccines authorised so far appear to be safe and surprisingly effective, especially at preventing severe disease (hospitalisation, requirement for ventilation, death) -yet, it was not known that this would be the case before the trial results were published.

Therefore, given data indicating high efficacy from the first dose of both Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines, the committee advises that delivery of the first dose to as many eligible individuals as possible should be initially prioritised over delivery of a second vaccine dose. This should maximise the short-term impact of the programme. The second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine may be given between 3 to 12 weeks following the first dose. The second dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine may be given between 4 to 12 weeks following the first dose.\""

If JCVI is asked by ministers to make recommendations in response to a question, then the government (and ministers and civil servants) is legally obliged to implement its recommendations. JCVI also undertakes 'horizon-scanning' and other activities -if it makes recommendations without having been asked to do so, ministers will consider the recommendations but are not legally obliged to implement them. If JVCI reviews the evidence and recommends a particular course of action, its recommendations outrank the license (or, as with the COVID-19 vaccines, their Emergency Use Authorisation) or the manufacturers' recommendations."

Hospital admission rates were unsustainable [49] [50] [51] and needed to be reduced; thus, vaccinating the people most likely to need hospital admission as quickly as possible was the top priority -we could not afford the time for a randomised controlled trial. Furthermore, as expected, mass vaccination provides masses of data. There was a rigorous postimplementation surveillance strategy in place that would soon provide real-world data on vaccine effectiveness. 52, 53 Would the delayed second dose encourage the evolution of vaccine escape mutants? This was another concern raised about the UK approach. The argument was that a single dose of vaccine would provide only partial immunity. This would permit the virus to replicate and immune escape variants would have an advantage. There is a clear parallel here with our understanding of antimicrobial chemotherapy where, if an antibiotic is present but in insufficient concentration to be bacteriostatic, the bacteria that could replicate were likely to be those that were most resistant to the antibiotic. There is little evidence of vaccination creating an immune pressure that stimulates the evolution of significant immune escape variants, although it remains a worrying possibility."

Influenza virus, by contrast, has segmented RNA, which allows chunks of RNA to be swapped between different strains of the virus -a process known as recombination -leading to major, sudden changes in the virus. This cannot happen with SARS-CoV-2. Every time the virus replicates, there is a possibility of an error giving rise to a new variant. It is large outbreaks and widespread transmission of the virus that have driven the evolution of variants. 54 Phase III trials cannot provide direct evidence that vaccination can suppress transmission and replication. However, the quality of cellular immunity induced by vaccines, as measured in vitro, suggested that this was likely.

Public Health England estimated that, up until the end of March 2021, vaccination directly prevented 10,400 deaths in England alone and likely prevented more through indirect protection (preventing people from being infectious). 58 Real-world (surveillance) data have demonstrated the effectiveness of the vaccines using the UK's 12-week booster strategy [59] [60] [61] [62] and this has been supported by laboratory findings. 63 We have even seen evidence of indirect protection. 64 We would not have seen such a significant impact on the burden of disease if we had used the dosing intervals from the phase III trials as recommended by the manufacturers. Doing so, whilst the bottleneck was vaccine availability, would have meant denying first doses of the vaccine to people in order to administer a second dose that provided only a marginal benefit to others and some of the people denied the first dose would have been seriously ill or died."
