In the absence of well-established scientific criteria, minimally invasive and arthroscopic may have the lowest infection risk and currently appear to be safer.

Sterile surgical gowns are part of the standard protection in the OR. In every surgery the OR team consisting of the surgeon, the surgical assistants and the scrub nurse wear sterile surgical gowns in order to reduce intraoperative wound contamination and to minimize the patient's infection risk. It is also a personal protection against blood and body fluids which often spray in an area of 3-8 m around the operating table. The safety levels of gowns for medical use can be classified in levels 1-4 [20] . Level 1 gowns should be used in minimal risk environment such as basic care or for visitors. Level 2 gowns should be used in low risk procedures such as venous blood draw. Level 3 gowns are generally used for moderate risk procedures such as arterial blood draw, or in the ER. Level 4 gowns are preserved for high risk procedures such as surgery or when infectious diseases are suspected. Helmets or togas might also be an option for protection against body spray, but only protect against airborne transmission of COVID-19 in combination with respirator masks. There are three different types of disposable masks available. Single-use face masks, surgical masks, and respiratory masks. Single use face masks, which are typically thin and consisting of only one layer are only capable of filtering rather larger particles (3 \u03bcm). Surgical masks are generally more effective than single use face masks in filtering virus-sized particles. A medical or surgical mask may be sufficient to prevent droplet transfer but do not offer protection against high risk AGPs, while a respirator mask is required for airborne infection. Air purifying respirator masks should thus be used as they are generally filtering smaller sized particles (0.3 \u03bcm) than surgical masks. The European Standard (EN 149:2001) classifies respirator masks into three different categories: Filtering facepiece 1 (FFP1), FFP2, and FFP3. FFP2 is comparable to US standard N95 [21] . Respiratory AGP require FFP3 masks or powered air-purifying respirators, whereas surgical AGP only require FFP-2 masks. The fitting and sizing of the mask is of utmost importance.
