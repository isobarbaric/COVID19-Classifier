            "text": "The roadmap to elective surgery resumption after this COVID-19 pandemic should be progressive and cautious. The aim of this paper was to give recommendations and guidelines for resuming elective orthopedic surgery in the safest environment possible. Elective surgery should be performed in COVID-free facilities and hospital stay should be as short as possible. For matters of safety, patients considered first for surgery should be carefully selected according to COVID infection status/exposure, age, ASA physical status classification system / risk factors, socioprofessional situation and surgical indication. A strategy for resuming elective surgery in four phases is proposed. Preoperative testing for COVID-19 infection is highly recommended. In any cases, COVID symptoms including fever and increased temperature should be constantly monitored until the day of surgery. Elective surgery should be postponed at the slightest suspicion of a COVID-19 infection. In case of surgery, adapted personal protective equipment in terms of gowns, gloves, masks and eye protection is highly recommended and described."

Testing of patients should also be organized before any surgery to avoid importing asymptomatic cases within the COVID-negative clinical pathway as well as to prevent secondary surge. Prescreening of exposed patients is of importance to avoid the planning of surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19 and adequate policy should be implemented to avoid peri-operative COVID infection. Finally, care should be taken to operate patients when a standardized and sufficient postoperative follow-up is assured. Nurses, the team of anesthesiology, physiotherapists should be consulted and aware that elective surgeries will start again to guarantee proper patient care."

The viral SARS Cov-2 concentration in articular, periarticular and bony tissues and fluids of infected patients is currently unknown. However, it is reasonable to assume that it is lower in musculoskeletal tissues than in respiratory or digestive tissues. Given these uncertainties, it is recommended to decrease those types of surgeries which generate a high amount of aerosol like electrocautery, working with oscillating saws as well as pulse lavage procedures [12] . In the absence of well-established scientific criteria, minimally invasive and arthroscopic may have the lowest infection risk and currently appear to be safer. They should be considered a priority if elective surgeries will be resumed. Surgical procedures followed by a hospital stay of no more than two to three days should be initially favored.

Within each of these phases, two scenarios should be considered through a careful preoperative screening of patients. Appropriate scheduling should be made according to the COVID status and patients with no sign of COVID-19 or who have recovered from the disease (categories 1, 2, 3) should be separated from patients with COVID-19 infection (suspected or confirmed: category 4, 5, 6).

The safety levels of gowns for medical use can be classified in levels 1-4 [20] . Level 1 gowns should be used in minimal risk environment such as basic care or for visitors. Level 2 gowns should be used in low risk procedures such as venous blood draw. Level 3 gowns are generally used for moderate risk procedures such as arterial blood draw, or in the ER. Level 4 gowns are preserved for high risk procedures such as surgery or when infectious diseases are suspected. Helmets or togas might also be an option for protection against body spray, but only protect against airborne transmission of COVID-19 in combination with respirator masks. There are three different types of disposable masks available. Single-use face masks, surgical masks, and respiratory masks. Single use face masks, which are typically thin and consisting of only one layer are only capable of filtering rather larger particles (3 \u03bcm). Surgical masks are generally more effective than single use face masks in filtering virus-sized particles. A medical or surgical mask may be sufficient to prevent droplet transfer but do not offer protection against high risk AGPs, while a respirator mask is required for airborne infection. Air purifying respirator masks should thus be used as they are generally filtering smaller sized particles (0.3 \u03bcm) than surgical masks. The European Standard (EN 149:2001) classifies respirator masks into three different categories: Filtering facepiece 1 (FFP1), FFP2, and FFP3. FFP2 is comparable to US standard N95 [21] . Respiratory AGP require FFP3 masks or powered air-purifying respirators, whereas surgical AGP only require FFP-2 masks. The fitting and sizing of the mask is of utmost importance. Only a perfect sized and well fitted mask leads to efficient sealing of the respiratory tract."

            "text": "The roadmap to elective surgery resumption should be progressive and cautious, especially in area of pandemic focus. Elective surgery should ideally be strictly performed in a COVID-free facility and hospital stay should be as short as possible. For matter of safety, patients operated first should be carefully selected according to COVID exposure, age, ASA physical status classification system / risk factors, socio-professional situation and surgical indication. At the slightest suspicion of COVID symptoms, elective surgery should be postponed. In case of surgery, close monitoring of COVID-19 signs and adapted personal protective equipment is highly recommended."
