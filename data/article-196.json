            "text": "In the year 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis intersected with the development and maturation of several digital technologies including the internet of things (IoT) with next-generation 5G networks, artificial intelligence (AI) that uses deep learning, big data analytics, and blockchain and robotic technology, which has resulted in an unprecedented opportunity for the progress of telemedicine. Digital technology-based telemedicine platform has currently been established in many countries, incorporated into clinical workflow with four modes, including \"many to one\" mode, \"one to many\" mode, \"consultation\" mode, and \"practical operation\" mode, and has shown to be feasible, effective, and efficient in sharing epidemiological data, enabling direct interactions among healthcare providers or patients across distance, minimizing the risk of disease infection, improving the quality of patient care, and preserving healthcare resources. In this state-of-the-art review, we gain insight into the potential benefits of demonstrating telemedicine in the context of a huge health crisis by summarizing the literature related to the use of digital technologies in telemedicine applications. We also outline several new strategies for supporting the use of telemedicine at scale."

            "text": "Rather than a very specific term, telemedicine can be broadly defined as \"the use of communication and information technologies to provide healthcare services without barriers of time and space\" (13). As a communication system, telemedicine proposes a brand new model for the production, transmission, and control of medical data and services. And telemedicine has already constituted an organizational innovation, continuously changing the form of diagnostic process, consultation, supervision, and education and training. The use of telemedicine can be traced to as early as the year 1877, when the first telephone exchange system was built in adjoining areas by 21 doctors to allow easier communication with the local drugstore (12). After that, although numerous attempts were made to advance informationbased technologies to augment healthcare delivery, the number of clinical telemedicine application practice was still relatively small and restricted, rather than deployed nationwide for quite a long time, mainly due to the clinical, financial, or technical barriers."

Fortunately, it has already undergone five of the nine steps of transformational change presented by Tipton Frontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org"

And as of December 26, 2020, COVID-19 had spread to more than 200 countries worldwide and has affected over 80 million individuals, with nearly 1.7 million known deaths (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). With the rapid spread of this pandemic, the global healthcare system has been experiencing a severe scarcity of necessary equipment, consumables, and staff. Therefore, hospitals should make efforts to determine the best way to provide timely and high-quality patient care and simultaneously protect providers who are already at the highest risk for contracting this disease (3) . Significantly, although tackling the direct impact from COVID-19 is important, in many healthcare settings, it is also vital to maintain the core and critical clinical service. However, in the context of the current situation, the initial reaction of healthcare facilities in a great number of countries is to reduce or even cease many clinical services, such as closure of clinics and postponement of elective surgeries or medical appointments. Actually, such strategies cannot be sustained indefinitely in case this pandemic extends over 6 months, or it must be fully considered if this pandemic even worsens. Therefore, all the healthcare organizations have been continuously striking a balance in their own ways, recognizing that constraints in certain resources can sometimes be limiting, while always placing the safety and care of all the potential patients as their top priority."

            "text": "As the saying goes, \"a crisis provides an opportunity\"; the crisis of 2020 would provide an unprecedented opportunity for the progress of telemedicine. During the COVID-19 pandemic, because of the containment efforts such as social distancing, quarantine, and cordon sanitaire, if indicated, medical professionals are confronted with great challenges in delivering healthcare. For such a situation, telemedicine has currently been catapulted into the core role of essential services for patients to help reduce the burden of COVID-19 and preserve some valuable equipment and supplies. Although few kinds of telemedicine services were available during the epidemic of SARS in 2003, since then, they have become more available following the popularization of internet services, the emergence of smartphones, and the fourth-/fifth-generation (4G/5G) transmission technology, making it ideal for addressing some unique challenges posed by this global infectious disease outbreak. For example, implementing telemedicine platforms can mitigate overcrowding in the emergency departments, providing the guidance that patients are seeking while addressing disease exposure concerns of low-acuity patients. Telemedicine can also help to deal with the ongoing healthcare needs from chronic illnesses patients while reducing in-person clinic visits. Besides, telemedicine can deliver specialty care to patients at distant regions where scarce intensivists are available, ensuring that high-quality medical supplies are reserved for those who are in need while reducing human exposures (among both healthcare providers and patients) to this highly contagious disease."

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and its subsequent spread has surpassed those of its predecessors (e.g., SARS), causing an evolving global health crisis. Fortunately, telemedicine networks have currently been established in many countries, incorporated into clinical workflow during this outbreak and shown to be feasible, effective, and efficient in sharing epidemiological data, enabling direct interactions among healthcare providers or patients across distance, minimizing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and improving access to patient care.

This term was first put forward in 1956 as \"the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it\" (29) . Although it was once believed that algorithmic decision making could surpass the accuracy of human judgment, AI was dismissed in 1987 by the New England Journal of Medicine due to \"the field of medicine is so broad and complex that it is difficult, if not impossible, to capture the relevant information in rules\" (30) . Since early 2010s, it experienced a resurgence mainly because of the improvements in computing power, development of AI algorithms, and the increasing number and quality of datasets (31) . Nowadays, AI is dramatically reshaping the landscape of our lives, ranging from facial recognition and search engines to self-driving cars and natural language processing. AI is rapidly evolving and also plays an important role in this pandemic to improve the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19. For example, based on the large datasets of COVID-19-positive cases from China (https://www.wired.com/story/chinese-hospitals-deployai-helpdiagnose-covid-19/), some AI algorithms have been developed and used as an initial tool for screening suspected cases (i.e., exposure to confirmed cases and travel history to China, South Korea, or Iran); thus, patients at high risk could be isolated or further confirmed with laboratory-based tests. In addition, an AI-based triage system, online medical \"chat bot, \" (32) has been implemented in context of this outbreak to help people recognize early symptoms and the importance of hand hygiene, potentially alleviating the workload of physicians."

In the context of this pandemic, big data provides great opportunities for carrying out modeling studies of the viral activity and guiding medical policy organization to enhance the preparation for this outbreak. Based on three global databases from Official Aviation Guide, Location Services of Tencent (Shenzhen, China), and Municipal Transportation Management Bureau of Wuhan, Wu and coworkers conducted a modeled study on \"nowcasting\" to forecast the COVID-19 disease activity inside and outside China, which could also be used by authorities for public health control worldwide (34) . Similarly, utilizing WHO International Health Regulations, Joint External Evaluation reports and the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index, and State Parties Self-Assessment Annual Reporting Tool, Gilbert et al. (35) evaluated the vulnerability and preparedness of African countries in coping with COVID-19, which would help to raise awareness in the health authorities to better prepare for this viral outbreak in Africa ( Figure 3A) .

Blockchain technology might have a role in addressing two challenges associated with the internet: trust and identity (44) . It is capable of digitizing reliable records in a way that is independent of a single database, which would allow the validation of certain clinical credentials across different care providers, providing great opportunity for supporting adoption of a new digital environment for improving healthcare (45) . In addition, utilizing blockchain technology in research might have potential for acquiring more public records of database that could help to address the reproducibility challenge via creating links across related communities. Besides, there are also attempts to use blockchain to battle with this COVID-19 outbreak. For example, many hospitals of China-or in some other countriesare collaborating with blockchain pharmacies and companies to deliver the medication to patients' doorsteps, thus allowing hospitals to deliver medications timely and also with accurate tracking (32) . Actually, the above technologies are highly interrelated and ultimately facilitate the running of telemedicine. That is to say, the proliferation of IoT (e.g., instruments and devices) in hospitals and clinics could contribute to the establishment of a greatly interrelated digital ecosystem, enabling real-time large-scale data collection, which can then be used by the AI, especially deep learning system, to fully understand the healthcare trends and the model risk associations and to predict outcomes. This should be enhanced by the blockchain technique, a network of computers distributed in different organizations and a back-linked database with some pre-designated cryptographic protocols, integrating the peer-to-peer networks to allow data to be copied in various physical locations, with certain modified algorithms to ensure the data are not only secured but also traceable (9) . The good cooperation between these technologies, together with 5G-based cloud servers, can offer network platforms as well as act as a dependable resource for the currently unprecedented development of telemedicine."

During this COVID-19 pandemic, one notable example is Iran (66): as of February 23, 2020, it confirmed its first 43 cases with a fatality rate of 19%, while the reporting transmission modeling prompts that the actual number of infected cases was in the thousands. The rapid global spread of the COVID-19 outbreak has been catalyzed by the insufficient communication and underreporting (67) . Healthcare facilities, from the local hospital to WHO, require tools that could improve the speed of communication to better manage the spread of infectious diseases. Telemedicine system based on modern technologies can be implemented for this purpose, as it possesses connectivity, computational power, and hardware to facilitate the electronic reporting and epidemiological databasing. AI and big data can help address the unprecedented amounts of data derived from public health surveillance and real-time epidemic outbreak monitoring (68) . For example, the online surveillance mapping tools, including the HealthMap (36) ( Figure 3B ) and Surveillance Outbreak Response Management and Analysis System (SORMAS) (46) , have already been used for surveilling COVID-19, with great potential to improve early detection of the infectious diseases compared with traditional epidemiological tools (69). Sun et al. (70) testified to the strength of monitoring COVID-19 epidemiological information from news media and social networks to help reconstruct the progression of an outbreak and to provide detailed patient-level data during a health emergency. Similarly, Qin et al. (47) exploited the big data technique to predict the number of new infected patients, either suspected or confirmed. Besides, Blue Dot, a Canadian company, has developed an AI-based surveillance system to reveal news of the pandemic, which is widely regarded as the first organization to detect the epidemic outbreak in late December 2019, well ahead of Chinese authorities and any other international institutions and agencies (71, 72) . Zhang et al. (49) described a real-time system for sentiment prediction of COVID-19 epidemiological information based on Twitter data. And by evaluation, it was found that predictive analysis with a random forest classifier has the best performance. Zivkovic et al. (50) achieved good predictive efficacy by using a hybrid algorithmic approach that combines machine learning, an enhanced beetle tentacle search population intelligent metaheuristic algorithm, and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system to predict new COVID-19 patient cases."

Jia et al. (37) based on the mobile phone datasets of 11,478,484 people egressing or transiting through the COVID-19 epidemic epicenter, Wuhan of Hubei Province, developed a spatio-temporal \"risk source\" model ( Figures 3C-E) to forecast confirmed cases and also to identify the highly transmission-risk locations at an early stage, which can help the local authorities to make better risk assessment and further to plan allocation of the limited resources before ongoing outbreaks. Similarly, supported by population migration data, Yang et al. (48) established a \"Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed\" (SEIR) model, which, combined with an AI approach, is able to predict the pandemic curve, and the authors presented that a 5-day delay in the adoption of stringent public health measures by the Chinese authorities would have led to a COVID-19 epidemic size increased by up to three times. Also, loosening or lifting the lockdown intervention in Hubei Province would cause a second epidemic peak by mid-March until late April. Colubri et al. (75) used AI technique to harmonize several datasets from the Ebola epidemic to offer informed access to the evidence-based guidelines. And then these guidelines were incorporated into an app of the Ebola Care Guidelines (75) . Many of these lessons can be re-applied for COVID-19. The app has the potential of including realtime updates of the evidence-based guidelines to inform both the general population and the healthcare providers. Integrating real-time updates into the EMRs could also serve as a reliable resource for guiding clinical practice. Telemedicine platform can be paired with the accessible information technologies to provide real-time, shareable, epidemic information during outbreaks like COVID-19, which empowers individuals, clinicians, and national and global healthcare agencies to adopt coordinated control strategies."

Direct-to-consumer telemedicine system, an approach to forward triage, could allow patients to be timely and efficiently screened; thus, it is patient-centered and simultaneously conducive to the self-quarantine, protecting providers, patients, and the community from disease exposure. Health institutions in many countries are offering free triage telemedicine assessments for COVID-19 by providing patients with access to certain websites or mobile apps that involve a short survey regarding the age, symptoms, and travel history of patient. Based on these results, respondents will be offered with tips, to visit a nearby COVID-19 testing site, or be connected digitally with physicians. In addition, health-focused chat bots, such as Lark Health (76) and Buoy Health (77), can also be used to interpret symptoms of individuals and further present appropriate advices. And Yan et al.

Community residents with respiratory symptoms, which might be early signs of COVID-19, could consult using the online clinic consultation services. Srinivasa Rao et al. (52) and Zahedi et al. (53) provided frameworks ( Figures 4A-C) based on AI algorithm and IoT that could enable quick identification of COVID-19 cases, by performing risk assessment on the symptoms and signs associated with this novel coronavirus though web-and mobile-based survey, respectively. And, depending on the replies, this algorithm could send alerts to the respondent, as well as to clinics or the mobile health units, for further health visits and case confirmation. Automated screening algorithm can be integrated into the tele-consultation process, and the local epidemiologic information can also be utilized to standardize the screening and practice patterns between healthcare providers. More than 50 U.S. health agencies already have such programs. Kaiser Permanente, Jefferson Health, Mount Sinai, and Cleveland Clinic, for example, all leverage telemedicine platform to allow clinicians to screen potential patients who are at home (67) . The D'Angelo team (54) utilized a human activity classifier based on convolutional neural networks and multichannel images to improve the performance of the new COVID-19 patient tracking application."

So far, 152 patients with the aid of telemedicine platform have undergone CT scanning that is remotely guided by WCHSU physicians (57) . Also, supported by the telemedicine system and imaging cloud services, radiological medical experts from the Wuhan Union Hospital of China communicated with their Kenyan counterparts regarding the CT imaging diagnosis of COVID-19 and also shared their initial diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 as a way to assist Kenya and other African countries in quickly mastering diagnosis and treatment methods of this disease. And as of March 23, 2020, it reported that 37 counties in Kenya had adopted China's high-end medical imaging equipment, cloud services, and their clinical application training and other onestop solutions, which were quite helpful for fighting against the epidemic (85) . Also, researchers developed AI models that could accurately detect COVID-19 disease and differentiate it from other forms of pneumonia, (61) which can be used remotely by physicians beyond the epidemic areas. As one example, Zhang et al. (58) recently reported their AI-powered CT diagnostic system ( Figure 6A) in Cell, which could diagnose COVID-19 with an accuracy of 92.49% and had been made available globally to assist the clinicians to combat COVID-19. Abdel-Basset et al.

Similarly, \"one to many\" is that one expert or medical team deals with multiple clinical scenarios, which can make better use of the limited expert resources to provide high-quality healthcare for patients, particularly in some extreme environments such as the current pandemic. Importantly, the cloud-based data could further serve as a \"Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine data bank, \" providing large-scale shared datasets for the wireless ultrasound (US) imaging analysis, which provides a great opportunity for AI technology development. Synchronously, the \"5G remote robotic US diagnostic\" system can enable realtime remote control for US scanning, thus eliminating exposure to COVID-19 to the greatest extent. Notably, in Fangcang shelter hospitals, where CT scanning cannot be performed and simultaneously there is a lack of qualified US physicians, it has already been successfully utilized to timely and accurately assess cardiopulmonary function of COVID-19 patients (82) (Figures 5C,D) . Together with the reported \"remote conduct CT scanning\" system, it marks a significant transition of telemedicine from traditional \"consultation\" mode to a new \"practical operation\" mode, ensuring excellent US/CT performance even in areas with limited experts or qualified technicians."

One notable example is the rush construction of Huoshenshan Hospital and Leishenshan Hospital in Wuhan, Hubei Province, where in a short span of 2 weeks is equipped with full 5G coverage and several other advanced technologies such as AI, robot, and cloud services. And importantly, the two \"smart hospitals\" can provide good examples showing the power of digital technology-based telemedicine system in the battle against the novel coronavirus outbreak. For example, an audio and video real-time interconnection system supported by 5G technique has been installed in the two hospitals to facilitate share case information among medical workers within isolation wards. With this system, staff in non-isolation areas and the administrative centers could also see the real-time situation in the isolation area through a large screen at any time and could ensure direct and effective communication at multiple places. In addition, the system can be connected via 5G hot spots, so as to allow multidisciplinary resources from other major cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou to help remotely diagnose and treat critically ill patients at Leishenshan or Huoshenshan Hospital. This tele-platform runs 24 h a day, so clinicians at the two hospitals could seek help online whenever they have difficulties in case diagnosis or treatment, thus greatly improving treatment levels. Also, robot systems with delivery and disinfection services, as well as remote CT scanning platform, have been adopted in the two hospitals to minimize the potential risk of cross-infection. It reported that, supported by these cutting-edge equipment, during the first 2 months of operation, a total of 2,011 COVID-19 patients were received by the makeshift hospitals and the overall mortality rate was 2.3%, and none of medical personnel contracted this highly contagious disease (87) . The two \"smart hospitals, \" together with Fangcang shelter hospitals, had played an \"irreplaceable role\" in the battle against COVID-19 in Wuhan of Hubei Province, and China's efficient use of modern technologies has helped the country gain the upper hand in its virus fight, which is a good model for other countries to follow in their fight against this disease."

At patient level, the evaluation data can be derived from self-reporting system or wearable sensing equipment. An extensive body of literature exist regarding the use of telemedicine system in remote monitoring of some chronic diseases just in this way (88, 89) . Indeed, the same concept can also be used for monitoring of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. South Korea, which can be touted as a good global example of effective pandemic response, implemented early a novel \"Community Treatment Center\" outside hospitals to treat mild COVID-19 patients (90) . To minimize the exposure of healthcare providers, patients in the center were asked to self-report their daily temperatures via a phone-based app (inPHR R , SoftNet, Seoul, Korea) for clinicians to remotely monitor their disease status, and the adherence rate reached greater than 80%, 2.3% of which were eventually transferred to inpatient units and 31% had been discharged at home (90) . Synchronously, considering the importance of reducing the amount of community spread of COVID-19 by keeping people at home, Cleveland Clinic, to our knowledge, is the first reported to implement a home-based intervention program that incorporates a patient-engagement app and monitors symptoms for the early intervention, ultimately promoting a holistic view of healthcare (91) . Interestingly, following the widespread interest in remote monitoring for COVID-19 patients, Annis et al. (92) conducted a study to evaluate the outcomes, acceptability, and lessons regarding the remotemonitoring program implementation. An existing third-party application, which previously had been used for enhancing recovery after surgery was introduced for monitoring COVID-19 cases, and 300 patients responded to the satisfaction questions regarding application, of which 74% had been extremely grateful about their experience using this tool, which demonstrated what could be accomplished through shared effective and imperative partnerships between industry and healthcare delivery (92) ."

Also, the automatic infrared thermal imaging temperature detection and warning systems have been adopted in Huoshenshan and Leishenshan hospitals of Wuhan to enable real-time and continuous monitoring of the changes in body temperature and automatically alert the febrile individuals, which could contribute to better management COVID-19 cases via early detection and simultaneously avoid cross-infection.

To reduce the contact between healthcare personnel and infected patients, the electronic ICU monitoring and surveillance program such as services offered by Sutter Health, Mercy Virtual Care Center, and Sentara Healthcare enables nurses and clinicians to remotely monitor the status of patients in the ICU (95) . At the HIMSS 2020, CLEW, a company focused on intelligent healthcare, demonstrated its AI-powered tele-ICU system to support monitoring of COVID-19 patients' status with certain respiratory deterioration prediction models, which was later installed in two Israeli hospitals (62) .

In China, these telemedicine services can be acquired through the websites of hospitals, WeChat accounts, and several widely used apps, for example, \"Huayitong\" (57) . It reported that by March 23, 2020, 31,905 patients had benefited from this service for prescriptions or medicines, greatly reducing the number of patient visits, easing the overcrowding in outpatient clinics, and allaying worry for patients with chronic disease (57) . Actually, telemedicine system is not a new mode for delivering healthcare for common and chronic disease patients, as it has already been used for ongoing management of long-distance clinical care, health administration, and education over the last few years, though several common modalities, such as livevideo tele-conferencing, store-and-forward technologies, home monitoring programs, and mobile health applications (96, 97) . Despite the great potential of telemedicine system to improve access to healthcare, its uptake is limited in scale due to interstate licensing barriers, inadequate reimbursement, and to some extent the resistance to change and lack of infrastructure (98) . The COVID-19 outbreak, particularly together with modern technologies, has, in the short term, accelerated the ever-growing development of telemedicine platform as a distancing measure to cope with this current public health crisis. Integrating the advanced digital technologies into the telemedicine platform makes it rapidly move to be the frontline clinical practice for chronic disease management, due to the demand for prevention and mitigation strategies; it has also been encouraged and facilitated by changes in payer-driven reimbursement policies, as well as government rules and regulations (18) . Currently, a variety of telemedicine tools, many of which are free or of low cost, such as Skype, Facebook Messenger video chat, Apple FaceTime, and Google Hangouts video, can be used for consulting specific care (99) , and this technology has been redespoiled and used across various medical specialties including pediatrics, neurology, dermatology, ophthalmology, psychiatry, and oncology (99) . For example, Serper et al. (100) in the context of COVID-19 crisis, launched a \"telehepatology tertiarycare team\" (telemedicine for advanced liver disease) via a VidyoConnect TM between tertiary care site and referring site, to guide the community-based gastroenterology practice. Net Promoter Score (NPS), a gold standard customer satisfaction tool, was calculated by the authors to help evaluate patient likelihood of recommending the telehepatology service to surroundings, and a mean NPS of 92 (range from \u2212100 to 100) was acquired from the respondents, indicating they had undergone a highly satisfied and excellent experience, well above the levels typically seen in healthcare settings, and thus telehepatology was proved to be a feasible, acceptable, efficient way to provide care to these patients with complex liver diseases while not compromising clinical care (100). Additionally, Grossman et al. (18) presented their tele-neurology platform in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by using synchronous audio and video connections between provider and patient, also integrated with an EMR, and showed that it is clinically meaningful mode for virtual services. Similarly, Garg et al. (101) provided a continuous glucose monitoring system by utilizing the commercially available software (i.e., Dexcom, Clarity, and Glooko) to manage type 1 diabetes virtually. Indeed, type 1 diabetes is particularly suited to such a kind of remote care, as most of the visits are built around reviewing data and consulting therapies."

Also, Prasad et al. (103) , drawing upon their experience, compiled a set of guidelines and a valuable patient handout for head and neck cancer patients to optimize telemedicine visit during the era of COVID-19. Synchronously, Quek's group (104) developed a telemedicine platform (video conferencing) between interventional radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians during this crisis to ensure continuity of care for cancer patients requiring yttrium-90 radioembolization; and at the time of writing their article, three cases including two cases of hepatocellular carcinoma and a metastatic hepatic carcinoma had been successfully treated without complications via this technology. Taiwo et al. (105) also proposed a remote smart home healthcare support system (ShHeS) that can be used by patients who need regular health checkups to receive consultations and doctor's prescriptions at home. Considering the importance of telemedicine system, the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) promulgated guidelines for the tele-nuclear medicine in remotely interpreting routine nuclear medicine studies, as well as in interpreting emergency studies in on-call settings (106) . This outbreak can enable a wider adoption of tele-nuclear medicine during the post COVID-19 era-not only in patient diagnosis and therapy but also in clinician education for certain developing countries with limited access to the formal training in nuclear medicine."

This announcement from CMS came as a specific problem for clinicians, as accurately interpreting the meaning of \"elective\" and well balancing this definition with patient health can sometimes become a major challenge even for the most experienced surgeons (107) . In this context, tele-surgery such as remotely guiding the surgical procedure or robot-assisted remote surgery can be the best option for both doctors and patients."

The instability of network and system delay should be the main obstacles of robot-assisted real-time tele-surgery. Fortunately, the recent revolution of 5G network with spectacular performances in high speed and low latency (78) has facilitated the clinical practice of remote surgery. Tian et al. (63) in collaboration of 5G network and orthopedic robot technology performed 12 cases of tele-robotic spinal surgery (Figures 5E,F) . All the patients had substantial relief from their symptoms, while without any intraoperative adverse event. Actually, robot-assisted spinal tele-surgery has been regarded as a popular and reliable surgical technique in the past few years (110) (111) (112) . Roser et al. (113) reported an accuracy of up to 99% for pedicle screw placement by the robot-assisted spinal surgery. Similarly, Lonjon et al. (114) presented that the accuracy of the pedicle screw placement was 97.3% by using ROSA robot system, higher than that of freehand method (92%). Nowadays, the breakthrough in 5G network system and robot technology, particularly sparked by this health crisis, makes the fast-paced practice of tele-robotic surgery. Huddy et al.

In the United States, Hamel et al. (117) launched a coronavirus poll and showed that 32% of the adults feel stress and worry associated with coronavirus, which had negative effects on their mental health, with a \"major\" impact rate of 14%. Also, in China, a COVID-19 poll of 2,091 inhabitants presented that the prevalence of psychological symptoms in mainland China 1 month after the outbreak was 4.6%, while this rate in provinces with higher number of infected cases was 18.4% (118) . These scientific papers are important in enabling global health authorities to allocate available health resources and undertake timely actions to minimize the psychosocial impact of this pandemic on the world population. Limited resources of psychosocial services in many countries around the world have been illustrated, which should be further stretched by increasing demand during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Comprehensive approaches based on telepsychiatry is proposed to cope with the lack of access to mental health services, which includes AI, as well as an array of advanced technologies, like internet-based psychological tools and services. For example, online psychological counseling services (for example, WeChatbased resources) currently have been widely developed by mental health professionals from medical institutions or academic societies throughout 31 provinces in mainland China (119) . Also, online mental health self-help intervention systems, such as online cognitive behavioral therapies for anxiety, depression, and insomnia, have been established (120) . Additionally, several AI programs have already been put into use as interventions for certain psychological crises during this epidemic. For instance, individuals at risk of suicide can be recognized by Tree Holes Rescue (a kind of AI program) (64), by monitoring and analyzing the messages posted on Weibo and further alerting the designated volunteers to take action accordingly. In addition, Di Carlo et al. (121) summarized the important role that technologies such as telepsychiatry played in the management of mental health assistance during the COVID-19 outbreak. The technology offers a promising approach to tele-mental health services."

            "text": "In the context of the COVID-19 outbreak, the rapidly growing modern technologies have brought powerful potential for many applications, which will globally transform the way in which we work, learn, and live. Among them, healthcare is such a specific industry that is experiencing an interesting transformation by integrating these telecommunications technologies. Indeed, to maximize clinical care though the telemedicine system, a closed loop is quite necessary, which involves patient-or practionerderived healthcare data and internet (e.g., 5G-Cloud)-based data transfer interpreted by the patients, medical practitioners, or certain automated platforms (e.g., AI, robot, and big data analysis) and returned back to the patients and medical staffs for better clinical decisions. And in turn, the large-scale shared cloud-based data would provide a great opportunity for AI development (Figure 7) . Increasingly, great amounts of real-world experience regarding digital technology-based telemedicine system have already been developed and can be conducted in four modes (i.e., many to one mode, one to many mode, consultation mode, and practical operation mode) (Figure 7) , which increase the medical staffs' capacity to offer high-quality care to more patients while protecting the personal health of medical staffs and saving public resources, by increasing the efficiencies and methods in which expert evaluation could be provided beyond geographic restriction. Importantly, telemedicine system has been demonstrated to be quite useful in handling critically ill patients, as well as the stable outpatients without barriers of time and distance. These are all good examples of ways in which telemedicine based on several digital technologies can currently address these unique challenges posed by an infectious disease outbreak such as COVID-19. Optimizing the application of telemedicine in this pandemic uniquely brings six domains of healthcare quality: as follows (Figure 8) : (a) safety: avoiding human exposures (healthcare providers, patients, and exposed community) to COVID-19 and reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection; (b) effective: providing care to all those who could benefit, for not only critically ill patients acquiring expert services but also people with mild illnesses getting the supportive care to avoid the consequences of delayed diagnosis, as well as reducing their stress and anxiety; (c) conservation: avoiding waste of equipment, supplies, and medical staffs; (d) timely: reducing wait time or some potentially harmful delays for both receivers and providers; (e) patient-centered: providing healthcare that relies on individual patient needs and preferences and ensuring that patient values should guide all the clinical practice; and (f) equitable: providing healthcare that will not vary in quality due to personal characteristics including sex, FIGURE 7 | The proposed data flow of telemedicine for clinical care: to maximize clinical care though telemedicine system, a closed loop is quite necessary, which involves healthcare data derived from patients and practitioners; transferred via 5G-Cloud internet; interpreted by the patients, medical practitioners, or with certain automated platforms (e.g., AI, robot, and big data analysis); and returned back to the patients and medical staff for better clinical decisions.

Despite the great potential of telemedicine in clinical application, we should note that its uptake has been variable, mainly due to interstate licensing barriers, inadequate reimbursement and concerns associated with the technical and clinical quality, safety, privacy, and accountability (such as who should be prosecuted if something goes wrong) (98, 128) . In this context, several strategies should be adopted to facilitate telemedicine to be globally used and integrated into the public health response to COVID-19 and future outbreaks."

            "text": "First, the lawmakers and regulatory agencies should promulgate some measures that could facilitate the widespread adoption of telemedicine. The key challenges in wide adoption of telemedicine can be the rule restrictions and legislative barriers. For example, the state licensing restrictions in the United States hamper the providers' ability to deliver healthcare, as they limit the patients' ability to access it. Thus, a national clinical training standard should be set by Committee on Medical Education and be adhered by medical licensing for physicians. Licensure board exams should be national but state-specific. Also, hospital organizations could develop and accept universal credentialing by certain proxy procedures to accelerate the growth of telemedicine delivery, and if possible, an international standard might be developed by the WHO for better transnational cooperation on some difficult public health issues such as COVID-19, because medicine is a special science without boundary. In addition, the full realization of comprehensive implementation of telemedicine requires federal governments and the public and private payers to develop policies that could allow reimbursement of telemedicine services to be equal to that of traditional care to reduce costs. Fortunately, CMS and some private payers have modified the payment policies in response to COVID-19. And Health and Human Services (HHS) waived enforcement of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulation to allow the use of video and audio communication for telemedicine visits (129) . This pandemic now serves as a call to action for these groups to work closely with medical experts to remove these licensure, reimbursement, and credentialing obstacles, allowing telemedicine to be fully integrated into our healthcare system. Second, we should invest time and effort in exploring a long-term secure platform if none is being used now, to define telemedicine frameworks and to develop clinical guidelines and written practice procedures and policies using case scenarios if necessary, for any outbreak at local, national, or global scales. The critical aspect that makes deployment of telemedicine services imperfect and inefficient during the COVID-19 outbreak in some countries such as Italy can be the scarcity of a standard workflow management system or a formal input on telemedicine given by health authorities, which is suitable for integration of telemedicine into clinical practice. Often, a standardized telemedicine protocol and monitoring system technology proposal should exist that are developed by the healthcare facility collaborating with the community site and need to be repeatedly tuned and optimized to ensure that telemedicine system can be operated immediately, safely, and effectively, when suitable."

The ever-growing technologies including 5G, IoT, AI, blockchain, big data, and robotic technology have markedly affected the progression of telemedicine, and they can be mustered and put into action to strengthen the construction and management of the telemedicine system. In an encouraging sign, all the technologies have already been applied in many respects associated with telemedicine in context of the COVID-19 outbreak and have been proved to be of great practical importance, for example, the \"big data\" resource in case identification, AI in tele-consultations, standardize screening, and tele-psychology. However, the property of these techniques has not been utilized to the most extent. Take the blockchain technique, for example; it can be fully integrated into the infectious disease reporting systems, enabling data to be automatically and directly reported to the final authority and be avoided passing through intermediary processing, which would greatly improve the efficiency of data transmission regarding the infectious disease outbreaks. Importantly, as any arbitrary editing for the data can be impossible, this blockchain technology will make circumstances of the outbreak be transparent to the public without manipulation (130) . In addition, the drone technique, which, to our knowledge has not been used in this epidemic, can be applied as a delivery method to ensure timely diagnosis and patient confidentiality. In the future, we can fully exploit the potential of every technique to help improve performance of telemedicine application."

Also, we can incorporate telemedicine into education and training process to increase routine use of telemedicine services. The preparative work should ensure that the people, equipment, administrative, and systems are all in place to respond immediately and effectively. Such preparedness is of vital important for response. Systems that are not used on a daily basis can rarely work well during disasters; telemedicine is no exception. All stakeholders are encouraged to collaborate to promote the evidence-based use of the telemedicine services during this pandemic and future outbreaks."

            "text": "In conclusion, although the world continues to adopt some classic public health measures to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, there are now various ever-emerging technologies that can be used to facilitate the application of telemedicine system to augment and enhance the traditional public health strategies. The COVID-19 pandemic can make a good \"case study\" for presenting the potential benefits of telemedicine in realworld clinical practice owing to those advanced technologies. Telemedicine provides a great opportunity to fully take advantage of modern technologies and simultaneously leverage the progressive push toward value and efficiency. Although there is a longer-term goal, the good performance of telemedicine to tackle this enormous, global public health challenge in the year 2020 will undoubtedly create great opportunities to increase the governmental and public acceptance of such a technique in the field of healthcare in the future, as well as to inspire lawmakers and relevant regulatory agencies to promulgate certain measures that will gain more widespread adoption of the telemedicine technology. And so, as predicted by Wootton (131) , in the coming years, the term telemedicine will probably lose the \"tele-\" prefix and become \"medicine\" with all the telemedicine work regarded as part of routine medical practice."
