            "text": "Viruses are biological entities, consisting of a single element of nucleic acid (RNA or DNA, in either single-or double-stranded forms) enclosed in a protective protein shell, or capsid, and are only able to replicate inside living cells. The virus's resistance to environmental stresses (temperature, pH, interaction with host cells, etc.) is closely related to the protein composition of the external structures of the virion. This is generally made up of repeated protein sub-structures, named capsomers, organized in polyhedral or helical symmetry [1] . These simple geometries can be formed with a limited number of capsid protein subunits, increasing their volume easily by repeatedly using the same proteins and consequently limiting the number of genes required for the synthesis of the capsid. The arrangement of capsid proteins in helical symmetry is a highly effective way to form tridimensional structures with repetitive subunits that, following the symmetry of the nucleic acid, have the same identical interactions that capsomeres have with each other. Therefore, modifications of capsid proteins, even of a single amino acid, may change the stability and/or metastability of the virion particles [2] . This eventuality is critical for the risk of viral infection, only reduced by several control techniques, such as heat sterilization, chemical disinfectants, air filtration, and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. In particular, disinfection using UV radiation is a fast-growing because it is chemical-free technology and with low risk of damage to materials (especially heat-labile ones) [3] . For this reason, main parameters should be considered for the elaboration of protocols to 2 of 12 guarantee the efficacy of the UV sterilization process, mainly in the latest period strongly marked by COVID-19 pandemic, where UV disinfection of surfaces and air has attracted tremendous attention [4] .",

            "text": "Bacteriophages (or simply phage) are viruses that infect bacteria and have several biotechnological applications, including their use as models for human viruses. Specifically, M13 phage is well known for the development of the phage display technique, which allows at foreign peptides to be exposed on the virion capsid [5] . The capsid of M13 phage is characterized by a helical symmetry structure, almost exclusively constituted by the major coat protein pVIII (responsible for phage integrity), and four other minor coat proteins, namely pIII, pV, pVII and pIX, which together enclose the circular single-stranded DNA molecule [6] . In the phage display application, the engineering with foreign peptides in the pVIII protein (representing about 98% of capsid proteins) permits the formation of landscape phage libraries of billions of clones, wherein each individual phage displays a random peptide on its surface. Phage libraries based on vector systems (88 or 8 + 8) result in a hybrid structure with mixture of recombinant and wild-type pVIII molecules on the phage capsid [7] . These random phage libraries are used in screening processes against desired targets to isolate specific ligands in the marker discovery, in vitro or in vivo [8] [9] [10] , or to functionalize surfaces for biosensors [11] [12] [13] [14] , as specific scaffolds for tissue-regenerating [15] , for immunization [16] , for drug-targeting [17] [18] [19] , for hybrid-materials [20] [21] [22] , for quantum dots, and for semi-conducting or magnetic nanowire devices [23, 24] . It is known that the capsid structure has been suggested to be responsible for the great resistance of M13 to various physical and chemical stresses (i.e., heat, both acidic or alkaline organic solvents, and variations in pH values) [25, 26] . About the susceptibility to the UV-C exposure, genome type and organization can play an important role against UV inactivation of phage. Phages with circular ssDNA, such as PhiX174, are most sensitive respect to that with linear ssRNA, such as MS2; while phage with linear dsDNA, such as PRD1, revealed the highest photoreactivation after UV exposure [27, 28] . In contrast to UV inactivation, MS2 showed a greater susceptibility to gamma or electron beam irradiation compared to PhiX174, whose inactivation revealed to have a clear dose rate effect [29] . Since phages have a limited ability to repair DNA, the shielding of their genomes by capsids may play a key role in their resistance to radiation. Studies on phage T7 would seem to highlight a greater sensitivity towards UV inactivation of intraphage DNA compared to the isolated one, indicating the role of phage proteins in the DNA damage [30] . Moreover, it has been seen that fd virus (with single-stranded nucleic acid) shows a UV sensibility midway between characteristic for the single-stranded and double-stranded nucleic acid viruses [31] . These findings had been attributed to the capsid structure, consisting in a helical structure, with a 60 A pitch and six repeating units per turn that protect the phage nucleic acid from tertiary structural changes induced by the UV-C irradiation [31, 32] . On the other hand, effects on biological components from UV-C exposure also involve protein, other than nucleic acids (RNA or DNA) [3] . Although many studies have been focused on the influence of nucleic acid on the UV-C radiation response, at our knowledge, no study has been reported on the role of physical shape and protein on the virus resistance to UV-C or other qualities and quantities of radiations.",

Specifically, in P9b the foreign peptide (amino acid sequence QRKLAAKLT) led to linear extension of engineered pVIIIs, respect to the pVIII wild type counterpart, with a significant increase of interactions in the hybrid capsid structure, both recombinant/wildtype and recombinant/recombinant pVIIIs (Figure 1 ; Table 1 ). Otherwise, in 12III1 the foreign peptide (amino acid sequence RWPPHFEWHFDD) induced a curvature of the engineered pVIIIs, with an increase of interaction numbers only between the recombinant pVIIIs ( Figure 1 ; Table 1 ).

In fact, pC89 was almost totally inhibited after the exposure to UV-C for 1540 J/m 2 fluence, according to the data reported previously [32] . In contrast, P9b and 12III1 phages maintained their viability under the UV-C exposure until 3080 J/m 2 (1.4 \u00b1 0.7 \u00d7 10 4 and 1.7 \u00b1 0.9 \u00d7 10 2 TU/mL for P9b and 12III, respectively). These results suggest that both the phage clones had acquired an advantage against direct radiation damage from UV-C exposure, respect to pC89. Moreover, the increase in UV-C resistance was in agreement with the increase of the interactions (predicted by the model) in the capsids of the engineered phages, as evidenced by the higher resistance of P9B compared to 12III1. H-bond and steric interactions favorably contribute to protein stability and could reduce the susceptibility of the hybrid phage structure to the modifications induced by UV-C, as also suggested by the experimental results. In fact, the number increasing of H-bond and steric interactions (pC89 < 12III1 < P9b) was positively correlated with the phage resistance to UV-C.",

            "text": "UV-C radiation, usually used in the disinfection of wastewater, is predominantly absorbed by nucleic acids, causing damage by the formation of photoproducts [36] . Formation of dimers (cyclobutane pyrimidine and pyrimidine) and photoproducts (pyrimidine) has been reported to increase in proportion to the UV-C dose, modifying the DNA structure. On the other hand, radiations can induce an indirect damage, due to OH \u2212 and H + products resulting from the water radiolysis [37] . Since the latter mainly involves protein structures, including individual amino acids, the radiolysis of water could play a role in the different behavior of the two engineered phage clones to ionizing radiation. At this purpose, the infectivity of the tested phage has also been evaluated after treatment with 1.5 M H 2 O 2 . Surprisingly, only P9b did not lose its viability, while infectivity of pC89 and 12III1 were decreased of 1 and 0.5 orders of magnitude, respectively, after 90 min of treatment (Table 3 and Figure 3 ). In this prospective, the amino acid composition of the foreign peptide could alter the degree of oxidative modifications in the capsid proteins, due to H 2 O 2 , which can be considered the most common indirect damage from radiation exposure. Specifically, peroxyl radicals can induce the formation of oxidation products by radical mechanisms, leading to fragmentation of the protein backbone. It is known that aromatic amino acids are significantly more reactive with the dominant reaction pathway being OH \u2212 addition to the aromatic ring [38] . In this work, 12III1 phage has four aromatic amino acids in its foreign peptide, while P9b none. Consequently, hybrid phage structure of 12III1 would not have an advantage in H 2 O 2 resistance, when compared to pC89. The remaining amino acids of the foreign peptide of 12III1 (namely arginine, proline, histidine, glutamic acid and aspartic acid) could also negatively affect the oxidation resistance of the phage clone. In fact, the radiation-generated ROS modifies protein by carbonylation to the amino-acid side chains, particularly occurring on Lys, His, Thr, Pro, Glu, Asp, and Arg residues [38] . On the other hand, amino acids sequence of the P9b foreign peptide, with only one amino acid favorable to carbonylation (namely arginine) makes the phage clone more resistant to H 2 O 2 respect to other phage, subject of this study.",

The models were built as reported previously [43] . Briefly, the structure of pVIII protein (PDB ID: 2mjz) was obtained. In the context of the whole virus particle of 2mjz, two pVIII proteins, Chain [1a] and Chain [1e], have been chosen for modeling the pVIII engineered proteins. Since these proteins are located at the same position between pentamer rings 1 \u2022 and 3 \u2022 , they allow identification of the contributing protein-protein interactions in the capsid structure [6] . The two pVIII proteins were kept like the single pVIII protein, in a PDB-format, namely chain A and chain E, and used as templates. Amino acid sequences of engineered pVIII proteins of P9b and 12III1 clones, with a foreign peptide inside of fourth/fifth amino acids of the M13 wild-type pVIII (plus two extra residues of Phenylalanine and Glutamine, encoded by the EcoRI site as reported in Felici et al.

Specifically, the germicidal lamp has a UV output power of 4.9 W and an intensity of 50 \u00b5W/cm 2 at a 1-m distance.
