MG produces a variety of metabolites that cause dysfunction of the respiratory mucosal epithelial cells. It can also migrate to the lungs and air sacs, leading to lung and balloon lesions, resulting in effusion [3, 4] . Typical symptoms of MG infection are severe weight loss, coughing, runny nose, and a vocal sound when breathing, with a slow and long course [5] . The disease can decrease the growth rate of the chicken and the conversion rate of the feed to bring huge economic loss to poultry farming [6] [7] [8] ."

Each strain was one group, each group had 10 chicken embryos, and the control group (FM-4 medium) was set up for the control. The volume of MG was 0.5 mL for each chicken embryo. After injection, the chicken embryos were cultured in an incubator with a constant temperature of 37 \u2022 C, and an amount of moisture was needed. The survival of infected chicken embryos was also observed and counted, and the pathological symptoms of dead and the blank control chicken embryo were also observed for one week.

Species annotations to the representative sequence of OTU with GreenGenes 13_8 database to obtain a relative abundance of the phylum level. It is shown here that at least a phylum that has a relative abundance in a sample is greater than 1%. The index Chao 1, Shannon and inverse Simpson were used to reflect the alpha diversity of the sample.

When the administration started, the number of bacteria decreased significantly, and the therapeutic effects of low MIC challenge were better than that of chickens with high MIC, according to most of the observations.

The CART (the classification and regression tree) results suggested that the CO CL should be less than 0.63 \u00b5g/mL ( Figure S9 ). Then the CO CL was analyzed with a logistic regression model with the MIC as the independent variable (X axis) and the Probability of Cure as the dependent variable (Y axis) ( Figure S10 ). The nonlinear regression equation was Y = 71.708 \u2212 9.463X + 0.453 X 2 + 0.206 X 3 , and the correlation coefficient (R 2 ) was 0.98. Non-linear regression analysis was performed that when the cure rate was 90%, the log 2 MIC was \u22121.9, so the CO CL was calculated to be less than 0.27 \u00b5g/mL. The CO CL were analyzed by the WindoW approach, nonlinear regression and CART analysis were 0.25 \u00b5g/mL-2 \u00b5g/mL, 0.25 \u00b5g/mL-0.63 \u00b5g/mL and 0.27 \u00b5g/mL, respectively.

For immunization, inactivated, live attenuated and recombinant vaccines are commercially available for MG [47] . Antibiotics that inhibit the metabolic processes of microorganisms, especially fluoroquinoles, are commonly used to treat the infection [48] . Reasonable treatment is recommended to control CRD caused by MG to minimize their economic losses. Although antimicrobials should be used prudently to slow the emergence of resistance, little research has been performed to establish the ECVs, CO PD , and CO CL of antibacterial agents against MG.

The study used nonlinear regression analysis to determine the ECVs, and the results obtained were the same as those simulated by ECOFFinder software."

In this study, the ECV of danofloxacin against MG was 1 \u00b5g/mL. A total of 111 MG isolates, representing a wide range of strains, were collected throughout China, which was considered to be a wide range of sources and representation. It was reported that the MIC range of Mycoplasma capricolum (M. capricolum) against danofloxacin was 0.1-6.4 \u00b5g/mL, and the susceptible breakpoint of danofloxacin against M. capricolum was 0.25 \u00b5g/mL [56] ."

It is said that as for a microbiological point of view, both empirical and targeted antimicrobial treatment in respiratory infection is based on the sensitivity profile of isolated microorganisms and the possible resistance mechanisms that they may present, which may vary in different geographic areas according to prescription profiles and vaccination programs [59] . Some MG isolates with higher MIC for danofloxacin were found in our study, which indicated temporal and geographic differences in the prevalence of resistance."

Xu et al. [13] fitted the PK-PD model very well by selecting the AUC/MIC in vivo as the parameter. Bonassa et al.

Because danofloxacin can be accumulated at the infection site (lung), the CO PD in plasma may not represent the significant parameters of the lung. The pharmacokinetic studies of danofloxacin on chickens are relatively few. Zhang et al. [70] reported that the C max , T max , and AUC 24 of danofloxacin in lung tissues at a dose of 5 mg/kg b.w. in MG infected chickens was 1.14 \u00b1 0.15 \u00b5g/mL, 2.67 \u00b1 1.15 h, and 10.26 \u00b1 2.42 \u00b5g\u00b7h/mL, respectively. It is different from the C max (4.71 \u00b1 0.29 \u00b5g/mL), T max (1.30 \u00b1 0.01 h), and AUC 24 (23.67 \u00b1 2.24 \u00b5g\u00b7h/mL) in our study. The differences in PK parameters among different studies may be due to differences in chicken breeds, and individual differences in experimental animals are also important reasons. Danofloxacin easily penetrates the tissue, so the drug concentration of danofloxacin in lung tissue was higher than that in plasma [11] . The C max could be reached in plasma and lung tissue for about 1 h following oral administration, indicating that danofloxacin absorbs rapidly in plasma and lung tissue. The infected groups had a higher drug concentration distribution at the target site, showing that danofloxacin is suitable for the treatment of deep tissue diseases [71] ."

This study used a previously reported method [72] to establish a real-time PCR method to detect changes in the copy number of MG in clinical trials, with the detection limit of 158 copies, which was 1000 times more sensitive than a regular PCR method. With the increase of the infection time, the bacteria increasingly colonize the chickens, which is consistent with the changes in the clinical symptoms of the chickens. The trial results showed that the effective rate and cure rate of the M2 and M24 strains were more than 90%, because the strains were sensitive, and the drug had a better therapeutic effect. The effective rate and cure rate of the M57 strain drug treatment group were low. The possible reason for this is that M57 may contain acquired resistance genes or other resistance mechanisms, and requires further study."

It is reported that the composition of the lung microbiota is increasingly well characterised, with changes in microbial diversity or abundance observed in association with chronic respiratory diseases [79] . 16S rRNA sequence data analysis showed that the chicken's respiratory tract contained various bacterial species. It is consistent with the report that Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the prevalent flora in lung microbiota [36] . The results suggest that the number of lung microbiota decreased gradually in the trial period, but there was no significant difference between the MG infected group and the treatment group. The OTU Venn diagram shows that the control group has the highest unique flora, and with a huge decrease in the infection group, the unique flora reached the minimum value with the treatment of danofloxacin. This trend might be caused by the reaction of the bacterial stress response [80] . It indicated that danofloxacin was effective against MG and killed many other bacteria in the chicken respiratory tract."

These genera may have significant potential targets for fluoroquinolone antimicrobial. Moreover, in the previous studies, the diminishing of taxa in response to antimicrobial treatment was also reported [83] . The results show that the respiratory tract's richness and diversity were generally decreased during the infection and treatment, which is consistent with the previous study [35, 77] . Consequently, the rational use of danofloxacin for the treatment of MG infections should consider the antibacterial effect and the influence of danofloxacin on the respiratory microbiota. Few pieces of the research reported the potential health impact of changes in the respiratory microbiota in chicken when treated with danofloxacin. However, there are adverse effects on the health due to disrupting the respiratory flora because of antibiotics."

Some dysregulation is only an abnormal change in quantity and generally has no clinical manifestations or only mild adverse reactions, which can be recovered naturally after drug withdrawal. However, antibiotics that were trialed by oral administration could affect autoimmunity by affecting gut microbiota colonization. Wang et al. [84] studied the correlation between gut microbiota and MG infection by disturbing gut microbiota in chickens with an antibiotic cocktail. The results showed that gut microbiota dysbiosis impairs pulmonary immune response against MG infection. The studies above have shown that antibiotics are a double-edged sword, so more attention should be paid to the rational use of drugs."

The ECV value was higher than CO PD and CO CL , indicating that certain MG isolates may resist danofloxacin. The ECV, CO PD , and CO CL values could be considered preliminary cutoff values. According to the CLSI M37-A3 decision tree ( Figure S11 ), danofloxacin's final clinical breakpoint (CBP) against MG is 1 \u00b5g/mL. These results provide a standard and reference for the use of danofloxacin in the treatment of MG. In addition, the therapeutic regimen obtained from PK-PD model is 16.60 mg/kg b.w. with a 24-h interval oral administered for three days. The research shows that the effect of drug treatment on lung microbiota should be considered when one therapeutic drug is needed."
