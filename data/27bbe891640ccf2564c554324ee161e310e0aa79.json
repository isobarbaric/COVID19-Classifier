            "text": "During COVID-19 pandemic, mutations of SARS-CoV-2 produce new strains that can be more virulent and evade vaccines. Viral RNA mutations can arise from misincorporation by RNA-polymerases and modification by host factors. Recent SARS-CoV-2 sequence analyses showed a strong bias toward C-to-U mutation, suggesting that host APOBEC cytosine deaminases with immune functions may cause the mutation. We report the experimental evidence demonstrating that APOBEC3A and APOBEC1 can efficiently edit SARS-CoV-2 RNA to produce C-to-U mutation at specific sites. However, APOBEC-editing does not inhibit the viral RNA accumulation in cells. Instead, APOBEC3A-editing of SARS-CoV-2 promotes viral replication/propagation, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the APOBEC-mediated mutations for fitness and evolution. Unlike the unpredictability of random mutations, this study has significant implications in predicting the potential mutations based on the UC/AC motifs and surrounding RNA structures, thus offering a basis for guiding future antiviral therapies and vaccines against the escape mutants.",

The ADAR enzymes modify adenosine to inosine to cause A-to-G mutations in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which play important roles in immune regulation ((15, 16) and references therein).",

The seven APOBEC3 subfamilies (including A3A to A3H) are reported to have restriction activities to DNA and RNA viruses (reviewed in (19, 20)). While most APOBECs use single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) as substrate for Cdeamination (reviewed in (17)), three APOBECs, APOBEC1 (A1) (21, 22), APOBEC3A (A3A) (23), and APOBEC3G (A3G) (24), are also shown to deaminate certain cellular single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) targets to cause C-to-U editing. Interestingly, the database analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomic variations showed an overwhelmingly high C-to-U mutation rate, account for about 40% of all single nucleotide variations, which was interpreted as a result of RNA editing by APOBECs rather than random mutations (9, 10, 12, 25) .",

An AAV intron is inserted in the middle of eGFP that can be useful to differentiate the mature mRNA transcript (with the intron spliced out) from the coding DNA containing the intron. A primer annealing to the exon-exon junction on the mature mRNA (JUNC, Fig. 1B) can specifically amplify the RNA, but not the coding DNA, by PCR, making it possible to rule out the C-to-U deamination on DNA from the direct C-to-U RNA editing by APOBECs.

First, the AccuScript highfidelity reverse transcriptase (known to have ~10 #$ -10 #% error rates) was used for the initial reverse transcription of the target SARS-CoV-2 RNA transcripts from the cells to single-stranded cDNA. The JUNC forward primer is used to ensure only mature spliced mRNA segments of SARS-CoV-2 were amplified (Fig.   1B) . Second, 2 cycles of initial PCR amplification of the cDNA were performed with a both forward and reverse primers containing a Unique IDentifier (UID), a string of 15 nt randomized sequences, to attach the large family of different UID barcodes (~4 '( ), discerning each original target molecule. Third, the initial 2 cycle-PCR products were purified and then amplified with Illumina adaptors (PCR error rate is ~10 #) ).",

The C-to-U editing by all three APOBECs is detected, with A1+A1CF and A3A showing much higher editing than A3G (Fig S1) . The C-to-U editing levels by each APOBEC are normalized by the control group (Table S2) . Here, we define the significant target C site where the C-to-U editing efficiency is at least 3 times higher than control. Out of 307 total C in the selected viral RNA segments, the number of significant target sites with A1+A1CF is 135, A3A is 67, and A3G is 11 ( Fig. 2A and Table S2 ). Analysis of the sequence contexts around the significant target C sites (with \u00b1 5 nucleotides from target C) showed that A3A prefers for an UCa/u trinucleotide motif and A1+A1CF prefers ACu/a motif ( Fig. 2A) , which is consistent with the reported motif preference for RNA editing by A3A and A1 (23, 29).",

Surprisingly, the C-to-U variant at UC241 occurred in early January 2020 and has rapidly become a signature of the dominant strain that spread worldwide ( Fig. 4C and Fig S4C) , strongly suggesting that this C-to-U mutation at UC241 generated by A3A editing may contribute to the better fitness for SARS-CoV-2. Although C241 to U mutation is within 5'UTR, the correlation of this mutation with the dominant new strains is reminiscent of that of the D614G mutation of the spike protein-coding region (5, 36). However, because 5'UTR has an important regulatory function for the replication of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs and for the expression of viral proteins (37, 38), the UC241 mutation may affect one or several aspects of these important functions of the 5'UTR in the viral infection steps.",

The externally inserted APOBECs are under tetracyclinecontrolled promoter so that their expression can be induced by doxycycline (Fig. 5A, Fig S5) . The Caco-2-APOBEC stable cell lines were then infected by SARS-CoV-2, and the viral RNA replication and progeny yield were measured and compared with the control cell line without APOBEC expression. The viral RNA abundance as an indicator for RNA replication was measured using real-time quantitative PCR to detect the RNA levels using primers specific for amplifying three viral regions: the Nsp12 region, the S region, and the N region.

A3A expresses in lung epithelial cells, and, importantly, the A3A expression level is significantly stimulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients (46-48) (Fig S6A, B) . A1 and its two known cofactors, A1CF and RBM47, are not expressed in the lungs but are expressed in the small intestine or liver (49) that can also be infected by SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig S6B) .",

Even though no apparent differences in SARS-CoV-2 replication and progeny production were observed in the control and the A1+A1CF or A3G-expressing stable cell lines, significant increases of the viral RNA replication and the viral yield were observed in the A3A-expressing cell line (Fig. 5B and 5C) . These results contrast to the known antiviral effect of APOBECs (17) (18) (19) (20) . Currently, it is unclear exactly how the A3Aoverexpression can promote the replication and progeny production of SARS-CoV-2. One plausible explanation is that, while most APOBEC-mediated C-to-U mutations may be detrimental to the virus and are lost in the viral infection cycle, some mutations beneficial to the virus's fitness will be selected for in the new viral strains. If so, SARS-CoV-2 can then turn the tables on the APOBEC mutational defense system for its evolution, including (but not limited to) the improvement of viral RNA replication, protein expression, evasion of host immune responses, and receptor binding and cell entry.",

Among many of the detected A3A edited sites on SARS-CoV-2 RNA in our study are three C-to-U mutations located in the 5'UTR region, UC203, UC222, UC241 (Fig. 4A, B) . The SARS-CoV-2 from patients detected all of these three mutations at different stages since early 2020, but only major circulating viral strains since early 2020 acquired the mutation at UC241 (Fig. 4C, Fig S4C) , suggesting that C-to-U mutation at UC241 is selected for better viral fitness. This observation is surprising considering UC241 is in the non-coding 5'UTR region and, thus, not affecting the ORF coding of a protein, as in the case of the previously reported D614G mutation of the spike protein for viral fitness (5, 36) . Therefore, this C241 to U mutation should not be related to a change of a viral protein function, such as cell surface receptor binding or polyprotein processing. Mutations outside protein-coding ORFs of SARS-CoV-2 were previously designated as nonfunctional changes (3). However, the 5'UTR region of SARS-CoV-2 has important function in regulating protein expression and viral RNA replication and virion packaging (37, 38, 52) . Thus, this UC241 mutation in the 5'UTR region may impact the viral RNA stability, replication, packaging, or the translation efficiency of the downstream proteins to endow the virus with better fitness.",

Briefly, reporter vectors containing DNA corresponding to the different RNA segments of SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2) (see Fig. 1A , 1B) and the APOBEC (A1+A1CF, A3A, and A3G) editor vectors (see Fig. 1C ) were constructed. A1+A1CF is constructed as one open reading frame (ORF) with a translational terminator sequence T2A inserted between A1 and A1CF (A1-T2A-A1CF), which will produce individual A1 and A1CF proteins in a 1:1 ratio. HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL), and penicillin (100U/mL) and maintained at 37 \u2103, 5% CO2. One day before transfection, the cells (250 \u03bcL) were seeded at an approximate concentration of 250,000 cells/mL on an 8-well glass chamber (CellVis). The cells were then transfected with a mixture (25 \u03bcL) of an APOBEC editor vector (500 ng) and a SARS-CoV-2 reporter vector (50 ng) and 1.5 \u03bcL of X-tremeGENE 9 transfection reagent (Sigma) and incubated for 48 hrs. After harvesting the cells, RNA extraction with Trizol (Thermo Fisher) and DNA extraction with QuickExtract (EpiCentre) was performed, respectively, according to the manufacturer's recommended instructions.

The details of our implementation of the method was described in (28) . We wrote Python scripts to analyze the sequencing data. We only considered those sequencing reads such that (1) at least 85% of the bases matched the reference sequence, and (2) the quality scores for all the UID bases were 30 or greater (probability of a sequencing error < 0.001). We clustered reads with the same UID and barcode into UID families. We only considered those families with at least three reads with the same UID and barcode. At each nucleotide site, the mutation frequency is calculated by dividing a numerator by a denominator. The denominator is the number of UID families that, at this particular nucleotide site, have at least three reads with quality scores of at least 20 (probability of a sequencing error < 0.01; because of this quality restriction, the denominator may be different at different sites). The numerator is the number of UID families that, at this particular site, (1) have at least three reads with quality scores of at least 20, and (2) 95% of these reads have the same base, which is different than the reference. The probability that three out of three reads will all have the same sequencing error at a site is then 10 -7 (=(0.01 3 )/(3 2 )).",

Unlike the unpredictability of the random mutations caused by RNA replication or ROS, this study has significant implications in predicting potential locations of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome based on the UC/AC motifs and the surrounding RNA structures. Such prediction of possible mutations in the coding and non-coding regions is especially meaningful with the new selection pressure from vaccines and antiviral drugs. The risk of novel immune escape or drug-resistant SARS-CoV-2 strains increases with the continued large-scale circulation of the delta and other variants among unvaccinated and vaccinated people. Thus, we envision that this study will provide a basis for future prediction of the potential mutations on the virus by APOBECs and other host factors for guiding future vaccine design and antiviral therapies against the immune escape and drug-resistant mutants.",
