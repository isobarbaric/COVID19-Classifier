Given limited available clinical evidence at the time, the list included a specific requirement for \"close medical supervision.\" 7 Since then, numerous studies have documented the safety and effectiveness of self-managed medical abortion, without the need for specialized medical care or direct supervision, which has been reflected in updates of WHO guidelines. 8 For example, 2015 guidelines issued by WHO describe the importance of health professionals other than physicians in the provision of safe abortion and specify that women can play a role in self-managing medical abortion outside health care facilities, stating that it \"can be empowering for women and help to triage care, leading to a more optimal use of health resources.\" 9 This has been reaffirmed in subsequent guidelines and protocols issued by WHO. 10 Thus, retrieving the evidence gathered over the years, the 2019 List of Essential Medicines removed the note requiring \"close medical supervision.\" According to the experts committee, this decision was \"based on the evidence presented that close medical supervision is not required for its safe and effective use.\" 11 These issues-the fact that medical abortion has been confirmed to be safe, effective, and acceptable; that it can be delivered by health professionals other than physicians; and that pregnant women can actively participate through self-evaluation and self-management-are fundamentally connected to states' duties under international human rights law, which include taking explicit measures to promote and fulfill women's right to health.",

Health regulations that are not based on therapeutic considerations-that is, policies based on overmedicalization-are incompatible with this requirement.

The UN Working Group on the issue of discrimination against women has expressed special concern in this regard, warning against laws and policies that \"provide for overmedicalization of certain services that women need to preserve their health without a justified medical reason. These include requirements that only doctors can perform certain services, such as pharmaceutical termination of pregnancy or obstetric care.\" 22 Overmedicalization not only disregards individuals' dignity (since people should not be subjected to invasive medical procedures when others more suitable and according to their preferences are available) but also contradicts the requirement that health goods and services be acceptable. This principle is tied to people's autonomy and the expectations and preferences of the individual seeking medical care. It demands that health systems adapt to people's needs and preferences when possible, as in the case of medical abortion. As mentioned above, numerous studies have shown that medical abortion outside of health facilities is a safe, effective, and acceptable method for women who choose to abort. A 2011 review found that \"there is no evidence that home-based medical abortion is less effective, safe or acceptable than clinic-based medical abortion.\" 23 The review examined three acceptability criteria-satisfaction with the method, likelihood of choosing it again, and likelihood of recommending it to a friendand noted that home-based medical abortion may actually improve its acceptability. Likewise, it has been found that the possibility to take the medication at home \"could enhance patient autonomy and privacy, and could provide women an opportunity to start the process with a partner or friend.\" 24 A qualitative study on misoprostol-only self-use conducted in Argentina-when abortion was legally restricted and mifepristone not available-revealed that women greatly appreciated the possibility of keeping their abortions private and being able to choose the day and place to perform it. 25 These findings are consistent with previous studies on women's experiences with medical abortion in other legally restricted contexts. 26 There may be many reasons why women prefer an abortion at home, one of which is the discriminatory practices within health care facilities, even in countries without restrictive laws. A study conducted in Scotland found that most women seeking abortion preferred the privacy of their own surroundings and that some women were fearful of being judged by health providers. 27 A 2017 study in Great Britain found that one-third of reasons for seeking abortion outside health care settings consisted of privacy concerns and either perceived or experienced stigma around abortion. 28 A recent qualitative study in rural Australia also showed that although women perceived abortion as an acceptable choice, they experienced a normative cultural positioning of abortion as shameful, stigmatized, and negative, which dissuaded them from discussing it with their physicians. 29 These findings are aligned with the alarms set by the UN Working Group on the issue of discrimination against women, which has expressed concern over the often humiliating treatment offered in health facilities. 30 Moreover, the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women has highlighted that mistreatment in reproductive health services is \"part of a continuum of the violations that occur in the wider context of structural inequality, discrimination and patriarchy.\" 31 While discriminatory practices must certainly be eradicated, medical abortion at home may not be the panacea for public health policies everywhere. Some women may prefer a swift manual vacuum aspiration in a health facility, while others may prefer a medical abortion at home. Neither option is per se more valid than the other. These approaches should be available when appropriate, so that women may decide the best way to meet their needs without unwarranted guardianship.",

Before the current health crisis, there was a growing trend to liberalize access to abortifacient drugs. For example, Canada and Australia have recently allowed the sale of both mifepristone and misoprostol in pharmacies, while the UK has allowed women to complete the abortion process with misoprostol at home. 34 Also, in Argentina, where abortion was, until recently, legal only under some circumstances, at least since 2015 health protocols provide for outpatient medical abortions for free in public health facilities, while misoprostol remains available by prescription in pharmacies. 35 The pandemic may be an opportunity to advance and deepen the rights and autonomy of women. In April 2020, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights entrusted states \"to guarantee the availability and continuity of sexual and reproductive health services during the pandemic crisis,\" while the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women instructed them to \"continue to provide gender-sensitive sexual and reproductive health services.\" 36 The UN Working Group on discrimination against women made similar recommendations and is drafting a special report on women's and girls' sexual and reproductive health and rights in situations of crisis. 37 Assessing states' performance in following these recommendations will surely shed light on concrete duties regarding women's human rights and the different health public policy options that can be implemented to ensure their full citizenship.",
