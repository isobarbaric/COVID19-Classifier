Reasons for the latter include receiving results more easily, reduced risk of contracting and transmitting COVID-19, and reducing travelling expenses. Reasons for preferring F2F included requests for physical examinations, more 'personal' consultations and opportunities to allay fears.",

            "text": "Although for most patients MM care was reportedly unaffected, a significant number reported less frequent appointments. In Italy, colleagues reported significant reductions in the number of detections of cutaneous MMs throughout southern and northern Italy during the lockdown period. 1 Interestingly, for patients who had dermatological surgery, there were no new cases of COVID-19 within that cohort 14 days postoperatively, and the authors implored the continuation of dermatological surgery for patients with MM. 1 Another study 2 found that total appointments to dermatology outpatients reduced to 58% during the first lockdown, with first attendances reducing to 43%, although the study did not distinguish cancer from other types of referral. MM diagnoses reduced to 54% of prepandemic levels by May 2020, although there was a rebound to 72% by November 2020. 3 The implications of this reduced incidence of new MM diagnoses remain to be seen in terms of patient outcomes, and may inform for future provision of MM follow-up intervals. A recent report suggested that up to 7.3% of patients in a pigmented lesion clinic have incidental findings that are only discovered during full skin examination, which was less likely during the pandemic and may account for some of the reduced incidence of MM diagnoses. 4 More than half of patients in our survey had experienced more anxiety/distress since lockdown, which reflects national data demonstrating an increase in psychological morbidity, 5 an emerging chasm that should be addressed in future national holistic melanoma guidelines, which is not currently addressed. 6 We believe that this is the first cross-sectional study assessing the implications of the COVID-19 lockdown as perceived by patients with MM.",
