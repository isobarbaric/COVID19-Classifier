The fight against this disease, which has caused millions of people's deaths, is still ongoing, and it is expected that these studies will continue for years. In this study, we propose an improved learning model to predict the severity of the patients by exploiting a combination of machine learning techniques. The proposed model uses an adaptive boost algorithm with a decision tree estimator and a new parameter tuning process. The learning ratio of the new model is promising after many repeated experiments are performed by using different parameters to reduce the effect of selecting random parameters. The proposed algorithm is compared with other recent state-of-the-art algorithms on UCI data sets and a recent Covid-19 dataset. It is observed that competitive accuracy results are obtained, and we hope that this study unveils more usage of advanced machine learning approaches.",

A group of input variables evaluates the predicted variable (dependent variable in statistics). With these variables, many tools such as trees, different regression techniques, nearest neighbours, boosting algorithms, etc., have been studied to put forward a model that maps the input variables to output classes. However, studies do not provide a desired level of accuracy most of the time. This study originates from such a need and requirement.

They claimed that the proposed model produced the slightest error for specific weight distribution by this process. Because the weaker learner you get, the lower error rate you reach. In another interesting study in (Bai, Xie, Wang, Zhang, & Li, 2021) , a similar AdaBoost algorithm is put forward which is close to the approach in here. Their model has three elements mainly and the learning performance of the model is reinforced by the AdaBoost approach.

In (Kiziloz, 2021) , five popular ensemble methods are implemented for feature selection, and models are run on known datasets from (Uci machine learning repository: data sets). When used as the only algorithm in the model, it has been reported that it executes fast; however, when they are used together and integrated, they perform better in terms of accuracy. This is believed to be reasonable, and this methodology is also performed in this study.

The parameters pl and gl of HLBDA are declared to be set to 0.7 and 0.85, respectively, and success rates are given in the study. It is told that after updating these two values as stated, HLBDA had a fast convergence speed, which means it gets closer to the final result very quickly. Then it is also claimed that HLBDA had a better success learning rate due to the other mentioned four algorithms. The results are presented in Figs. 7 and 8 . The results of model performance due to the training set and the model is as seen in Fig. 7 . Though the proposed algorithm in that study is told to be converged very quickly, E-ADAD trains all training set in 0.14 s and it reaches a better accuracy rate in the period. Fig. 8 shows the accuracy rates of all algorithms. E-ADAD has got a 95.33% accuracy rate, and this value is the mean of 10 independent runs.

Anyway, proportions are being preserved as they are on the whole. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is also another parameter to evaluate classifier output quality. One characteristic of ROC curves is that the \"true positive rate\"s are placed on the Y axis, while \"false positive rate\"s are on the X-axis. In other words, the top left corner of the plot is the \"ideal\" point -a false positive rate of zero, and a true positive rate of one. However, this point is an extreme, but the closer the better.
