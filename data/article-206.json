            "text": "Social distancing measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic will make anatomy dissecting room practicals difficult, if not impossible to run at some institutions in the upcoming academic year. The learning community that exists within physical anatomy practicals needs to be moved online. Virtual replacement of visuo-spatial and social elements of learning anatomy pose particular challenges to educators. Our department has trialed Blackboard Collaborate, an online communication platform in conjunction with Visible Body, a 3D anatomical modeling program. We have delivered 266 hr of synchronous small group teaching to medical and physician associate students. We describe this approach and discuss the relevance of distance learning pedagogy to the design of new online anatomy teaching and development of online learning communities."

            "text": "On March 23, 2020, the UK government implemented a national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which halted all face-to-face (F2F) teaching at UK based universities (UK Government, 2020) . Faculties raced to develop remote, virtual alternatives to teaching (Evans et al., 2020) . Our institution has been preparing online teaching based on the assumption of continued cancellation of large group F2F teaching in the 2020/21 academic year. The utilization of virtual resources in anatomy education has grown significantly over the past two decades (Trelease, 2015) . However, until the pandemic, the mainstay of anatomy teaching in the United Kingdom (UK) and Republic of Ireland (ROI) remained the use of cadaveric material in practical classes and dissections (Heylings, 2002; Longhurst et al., 2020) . This included our institution, where anatomy education involved lectures, prosection-based practicals and asynchronous online resources with dissection available in student selected components of the course. While it has been relatively straightforward to replace live lectures by distributing lecture recordings, it is less clear how learning achieved in practical classes and dissections can be replaced online."

They analyzed concerns and adaptations of 14 anatomy departments in the UK and ROI during the COVID-19 pandemic. The removal of physical practicals evoked concerns amongst educators including reduced visuospatial learning, the loss of student-student and student-teacher Our department has implemented virtual anatomy practicals for medical students and physician associate students over 2 months during lockdown using \"Blackboard Collaborate\" (BBC). Its use as a virtual classroom in anatomy education has been demonstrated previously in the literature (Attardi, Barbeau, & Rogers, 2018; Attardi & Rogers, 2015) . This platform now offers functions with great interactive and collaborative potential, but their use has not yet been described in anatomy education. Given educators' concerns regarding loss of F2F practicals, we describe our approach to online anatomy education during lockdown, which exploited these functions in an attempt to enhance student-student and student-teacher interactions and grow a virtual learning community. To distinguish them from their F2F equivalents, we will refer to these online practicals as webinars."

            "text": "Learning cannot be separated from the social contexts in which it occurs (Brown, Collins, & Duguid, 1989) . In classrooms, interactions between participants can been said to create a community of inquiry where learning is the product of discussion and debate (Lipman, 2003) . In the anatomy dissecting room, students agree that interaction with peers and staff is helpful for their learning (Johnson, Palmer, Burton, & Brockhouse, 2013) . Learning communities are not only important in the physical world, but are argued to be the most important factor in establishing successful online learning (Palloff & Pratt, 2007) and attempts to develop them are widely advocated in distance learning literature (Fiock, 2020) . The concept of a community of inquiry was applied to distance learning courses by academics at the University of Alberta in Canada who published a Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework (Garrison, Anderson, & Archer, 2000) . This collaborative-constructivist model aimed to highlight the core components of a community of inquiry, to ensure that they are maintained when moving education from physical to virtual learning environments. It was initially developed for information technology education using asynchronous computer mediated communication (CMC) and has since become widely used in both asynchronous and synchronous online education (Castellanos-Reyes, 2020). Garrison (2011) defined a CoI as \"a group of individuals who collaboratively engage in purposeful critical discourse and reflection to construct personal meaning and confirm mutual understanding\" (p. 15). They describe three key components required to provide a good educational experience within a CoI: social presence, cognitive presence, and teaching presence. Social presence is described as \"the ability of participants in the Community of Inquiry to project their personal characteristics into the community, thereby presenting themselves to the other participants as real people\" (Garrison et al., 2000, p. 89) . It is provided by an environment in which participants can interact comfortably and freely. This can be used to grow a cognitive presence, defined as \"the extent to which learners are able to construct and confirm meaning through sustained reflection and discourse in a critical community of inquiry\" (Garrison, Anderson, & Archer, 2001, p. 11) . In other words, a cognitive presence refers to learning that occurs through discussion between students and teachers. Teaching presence refers to both the design and facilitation of educational experiences to enhance cognitive and social processes (Anderson, Rourke, Garrison, & Archer, 2001) . By considering these three presences we can explore how best to develop functioning virtual learning communities in anatomy education."

We used these features to encourage students to work collaboratively in group activities (Figures 2 and 3) . These included labeling key structures, questions to prompt discussion of key concepts, and challenging students to construct their own anatomical diagrams and models. Further interactive functions of BBC include an inbuilt polling system, through which facilitators can design custom multiple choice questions and answers to be presented during the session. This can be used to assess or gain feedback from students in real time.

More recently, with advances in video conferencing technologies, it has been possible to use modeling software to demonstrate 3D anatomy remotely with expert commentary. Attardi and Rogers (2015) were the first to describe this synchronously, using digital 3D models to create an online dissecting room. Students found these useful, and those taught online performed similarly in assessments to those taught in more traditional practicals (Attardi et al., 2018) . We employed Visible Body in our webinars as it has been well rated for this purpose, although other programs are available (Attardi & Rogers, 2015; Lewis, Burnett, Tunstall, & Abrahams, 2014) . We used virtual models in a similar manner to cadavers or plastic models in the physical dissecting room. This included demonstration and narration by teachers, but more importantly using them as stimuli to provoke student discussion, and as a reference to help students answer questions, including their own. Being able to refer to a 3D model in real time was invaluable to explain more difficult concepts. There are some potential benefits to using virtual models, other than remote availability. All students can gain a view and perspective identical to that of the teacher, and structures can be rapidly manipulated, dissected and zoomed in on, a feat not easily achieved in physical laboratories. Informal feedback suggested that students found the use of Visible Body 3D modeling software helpful, particularly when approaching more challenging subject matter."

Although some students prefer less overwhelming virtual environments (Smith, Martinez-Alvarez, & McHanwell, 2014) , many educators feel that learning from cadaveric \"patients\" in the near clinical environment of the dissecting room is an essential part of anatomy education for future clinicians (Korf et al., 2008) . Providing clinical context in anatomy teaching has been found to improve student performance (Bergman, Prince, Drukker, van der Vleuten, & Scherpbier, 2008) . For many logistical reasons, including time, cost, and where legal limitations to the use of cadaveric images exist, this experience cannot be fully replicated online (Korf et al., 2008) . Although the pathology and variation of cadaveric material may be missing, it is still possible to provide clinical context online. We situated anatomy problems within patient cases while incorporating clinical imaging, and referencing practical skills and procedures. Screensharing of recorded surgical procedures was not possible due to video lag, but may be more feasible on other platforms such as BigBlueButton.

There is a need for anatomy education to continue to provide for development of these skills online, for use in the physical world but also for virtual professional contexts as online patient consultation becomes more commonplace (Sartori, Olsen, Weinshel, & Zabar, 2019) . Facilitating collaborative, clinically relevant activities in anatomy webinars may help achieve this. Finally, reducing F2F elements of education has implications for student welfare. New and returning students will be more physically and socially isolated and there are concerns about the potential impact of this on their mental health and wellbeing (Gishen, Bennet, & Gill, 2020) . Cultivating a sense of belonging and community through the anatomy curriculum may be one way to help mitigate this (Thomas, 2012) ."

            "text": "At a time when social distancing measures are isolating students from family and friends, it may be more important than ever to provide a sense of community in our teaching. Although evidence and experience describing how best to do this in anatomy education is limited, distance-learning pedagogy can inform the design of teaching to help develop new online communities of anatomical inquiry. We have found running synchronous teaching incorporating small group learning activities to be a viable approach, even for large student cohorts."

            "text": "Distance-learning pedagogy would suggest that harnessing the collaborative and interactive functions now available in online communication platforms could develop social and cognitive presence in teaching. In our faculty's opinion these functions and the group learning activities they afforded were vital to maintain student engagement and enhance learning in webinars. The main limitations to our experience include that students and teachers were already known to each other from past F2F teaching, and that the evaluation occurred over 2 months only. Students who have not met peers or faculty members in a F2F setting, or who have more prolonged periods of online education may engage differently. Detailed investigation will be required to assess the impact of virtual curricula on anatomy education, and the student experience. Applying the Community of Inquiry framework may allow for an holistic evaluation of online anatomy education, and a survey instrument to facilitate this has been previously validated in healthcare education settings (Carlon et al., 2012) . Future research could assess the validity of the CoI survey instrument in anatomy education, and compare the degree to which a CoI can be achieved across varying online approaches of different institutions."
