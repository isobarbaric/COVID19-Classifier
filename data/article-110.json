            "text": "In March 2021, Khan et al published a commentary titled 'Decolonising global health in 2021: a roadmap to move from rhetoric to reform' in BMJ Global Health. 1 To our knowledge, under the decolonising global health umbrella, this is the first publication to make explicit how to move from theory to practice. However, we express concern over the prescriptive nature of this commentary, namely in its call for 'metrics,' 'checklists,' and a 'map'-unironically all tactics that have been and are used by colonisers to assert violence. In this commentary, we directly respond to Khan et al and join the larger discussion on what it may mean for decolonising global health to move from theory to practice. First, we address the definition of decolonisation in decolonial thought, followed by the definition used by Khan et al. Second, we critically deconstruct the suggested \"roadmap,\" and conclude that these \"reforms\" will not realise the definition of decolonisation. Finally, we suggest conceptual frameworks that may be better suited to think through decolonisation in the global health industry."

            "text": "We recognise that the decolonisation of the global health industry can take different forms. However, we believe that if we are serious about decolonisation this must be grounded within decolonial theory. In this article, we ground our definition of decolonisation with Frantz Fanon. Fanon provides an explicit definition of decolonisation worth quoting at length: Decolonization is quite simply the replacing of a certain 'species' of men by another 'species' of men \u2026 Decolonization never takes place unnoticed, for it influences individuals and modifies them fundamentally. It transforms spectators crushed with their inessentiality into privileged actors, with the grandiose glare of history's floodlights upon them. It brings a natural rhythm into existence, introduced by new men, and with it a new language and a new humanity. Decolonization is the veritable creation of new men. \u2026 The 'thing' which has been colonized becomes man during the same process by which it frees itself. In decolonization, there is therefore the need of a complete calling in question of the colonial situation. If we wish to describe it precisely, we might find it in the well known words: 'The last shall be first and the first last'. Decolonization is the putting into practice of this sentence. 2 Thus, in our interpretation of Fanon, decolonisation means the exact moment of colonial departure. In other words, Fanon makes explicit that decolonisation is an entire systemic overhaul only accomplished by the removal of the coloniser or dismantling of structures that preserve power. (table 1 "

To reform something means to reconstruct the existing system of power, but does not mean to remove the system's power. As such, although not made explicit, their employment of decolonisation for decolonising global health, is a call for the reform of a colonial structure while maintaining colonising powers. We are particularly concerned with the use of metrics for decolonisation, which reduces the process of decolonisation to a metaphor for reform. 3 This echoes wider concerns in the literature that 'much of what appears to be reform in our time is in fact the defence of stasis'. 4 When colonising powers are maintained, reform cannot accomplish decolonisation as seen through Fanon: the moment of departure from this colonial power through an entire systemic overhaul."

            "text": "It is important to explicitly address white supremacy, racism, sexism, capitalism and other oppressive ideologies in the process of decolonisation. These concepts exist(ed) as rationalising centres in the formation of colonial epistemologies. Scholars have noted how the global health industry's predecessors, tropical medicine and international health, existed as tools to extract resources for capitalist agendas. The industry was grounded on the premise of protecting colonisers from rampant, tropical illnesses as they pillaged land and resources around the globe. For example, the Gorgas campaign to eradicate yellow fever in Cuba in the early 1900s was concerned more with the health of foreign white Americans than the indigenous population. Many of whom were immune and did not consider it to be a priority health issue. Although such campaigns may have been successful in eradicating disease, they tended to be unwanted and enforced by military authority. 5 The global health industry continues to be colonial in its structure, and this power dynamic is even more pronounced in the field now than in the past. The ongoing oppression and exploitation of racialised people, particularly black and indigenous have constructed modern medicine and public health and contributed to the economic gain of colonial powers. In addition, enslaved and colonised people were used as test subjects for medical experimentation and medical and scientific advancement. This is evidenced by J. Marion Sims, the 'father of modern gynaecology,' who experimented on unanesthetised, enslaved black women without their consent. 6 Scholars have theorised how today we have entered an era of 'biocapitalism;' specifically, before health equity can be discussed, the health of a body must first be made available to capitalism as an object of intervention for monetary extraction. 7 Today, the global health industry's priorities are determined by and for the richest and most powerful nations. This has been demonstrated by the current COVID-19 pandemic and the inequities in the production and distribution of vaccines. Pharmaceutical monopolies and intellectual property restrictions have caused significant shortages and restrictions. A waiver of such intellectual property restrictions has been opposed by large pharmaceutical companies and rich nations. At the time of writing, the vast majority of vaccine doses have been purchased by wealthy nations, while poorer countries have been forced to wait their turn; or, depend on the 'benevolence' and 'generosity' of richer countries as they donate unused doses. 8 The COVID-19 pandemic has again illustrated how white supremacy, racism, sexism and capitalism still remain tied as central, rationalising logics for the global health industry. For example, 'lower-ranking' healthcare workers such as custodial staff and nurses, who tend to be For the global Health industry, three terms of this quote hold parallels. First, new men indicates not only a replacement of leadership, but the necessity of opening the confines of global health to the perspectives of the 'other.' Second, the term new language is Fanon's prescription, suggesting that any form of prescription must make room for new language and ways of thinking that allow the perspective of the former other to be heard and claim ownership. Third, the term new humanity is the outcome of the above two steps, suggesting an entirely different paradigm undergirding the logics of global health.

While these workers have been essential in the medical response to the pandemic, they often received less institutional protection by not being provided adequate personal protection equipment. 9 Examples of the contemporary global health industry indicate that colonial power was not merely a one-off event, but has persisted in a continuum that has reallocated these dimensions of power to new forms of health administration. This also indicates that, while the contours of capitalism are blatantly clear in some examples of COVID-19, they also become hidden within further structures such as philanthro-capitalism. At present, the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)-largely funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation as well as pharmaceutical companies and the oil industry-has become a trusted source of global health data, eclipsing governments and the WHO. 10 The IHME produces data that is based on complex modelling that cannot be replicated or adequately peer-reviewed due to a lack of transparency and the large capacity required to do so. 11 Further, the Gates Foundation intervened in Oxford's COVID-19 vaccine trial funding to mandate a commercial patent and at the time of writing continues to oppose intellectual property waivers. 12 The concepts of white supremacy, racism, sexism and capitalism were not addressed in Khan et al's commentary; yet, we believe these should be the centre of the discussion. Equity and justice were not, and currently are not, the aim of global health; despite the wide ranging utopic brandings of health equity programmes within the global health industry, the underlying determinants produced by the conditions of possibility of white supremacy, racism, sexism and capitalism are still ever present, creating a power which forecloses the ability to realise health equity. To realise a decolonised global health, if ever, we suggest these are the concepts to address. Now, we turn to Khan et al's roadmap to review what this roadmap can and cannot do to the coloniality of the global health industry."

To analyse this roadmap, we will work backwards from the third recommendation to analyse first what this may do to the practice of global health, and later to the distribution of power within global health.

As evidenced by the example of the IHME above, the definition of metrics can remain malleable to the 'administrative and worldly aspirations' of the coloniality of the global health industry to this day. Therefore, the colonial logics of capital are immediately inscribed into the epistemology and analysis of global health metrics.
