            "text": "Context: Despite the massive scale of COVID-19 case investigation and contact tracing (CI/CT) programs operating worldwide, the evidence supporting the intervention's public health impact is limited. Objective: To evaluate the Public Health-Seattle & King County (PHSKC) CI/CT program, including its reach, timeliness, effect on isolation and quarantine (I&Q) adherence, and potential to mitigate pandemic-related hardships. Design: This program evaluation used descriptive statistics to analyze surveillance records, case and contact interviews, referral records, and survey data provided by a sample of cases who had recently ended isolation. Setting: The PHSKC is one of the largest governmental local health departments in the United States. It serves more than 2.2 million people who reside in Seattle and 38 other municipalities. Participants: King County residents who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between July 2020 and June 2021. Intervention: The PHSKC integrated COVID-19 CI/CT with prevention education and service provision. Results: The PHSKC CI/CT team interviewed 42 900 cases (82% of cases eligible for CI/CT), a mean of 6.1 days after symptom onset and 3.4 days after SARS-CoV-2 testing. Cases disclosed the names and addresses of 10 817 unique worksites (mean = 0.8/interview) and 11 432 other recently visited locations (mean = 0.5/interview) and provided contact information for 62 987 household members (mean = 2.7/interview) and 14 398 nonhousehold contacts (mean = 0.3/interview). The CI/CT team helped arrange COVID-19 testing for 5650 contacts, facilitated grocery delivery for 7253 households, and referred 9127 households for financial assistance. End of I&Q Survey participants (n = 304, 54% of sampled) reported self-notifying an average of 4 nonhousehold contacts and 69% agreed that the information and referrals provided by the CI/CT team helped them stay in isolation. Conclusions: In the 12-month evaluation period, CI/CT reached 42 611 households and identified thousands of exposure venues. The timing of CI/CT relative to infectiousness and difficulty eliciting nonhousehold contacts may have attenuated the intervention's effect. Through promotion of I&Q guidance and services, CI/CT can help mitigate pandemic-related hardships."

[1] [2] [3] Efforts to rapidly bring COVID-19 contact tracing to scale presented substantial challenges. These included difficulties commonly encountered by CI/CT programs designed to control other infectious diseases, including the inability to locate accurate phone numbers; nonresponse to call attempts; reluctance to disclose information; imperfect informatics systems; communication barriers; and multiagency coordination. 4, 5 The biology and unprecedented scale of COVID-19 also posed unique challenges to CI/CT programs. 6 The short transmission interval and period of asymptomatic transmissible infection associated with SARS-CoV-2 necessitated that outreach to cases and contacts occurs as quickly as possible, especially in the context of variants such as Delta and Omicron. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] When case counts exceed programmatic capacity, CI/CT programs had to choose how to prioritize case interviews, outbreak investigations, and follow up with contacts. 2 Given these novel disease dynamics, COVID-19 CI/CT program activities and outcomes differ from other infectious disease CI/CT activities and are not widely documented in the scientific literature."

            "text": "Health departments in the United States and many other nations have now provided CI/CT to millions of people. Despite the massive scale of COVID-19 CI/CT, the evidence supporting its public health impact is limited and derived largely from mathematical models, many of which were parameterized without programmatic data. [11] [12] [13] [14] Empiric studies of COVID-19 contact tracing have, to date, focused primarily on metrics such as the percentage of cases interviewed, number of contacts elicited and notified of exposure, and timeliness of case and contact interview, [15] [16] [17] [18] with little data on how CI/CT may have affected adherence to I&Q guidelines or rates of infection. 19 Most evaluations have also ignored the role of CI/CT programs in linkage to services and the corresponding impact of CI/CT in mitigating pandemic-related hardships that disproportionately affect communities that are lower-income, historically marginalized, and have experienced the highest rates of COVID- 19. In early 2022, national public health agencies recommended that health departments cease to provide universal CI/CT and instead prioritize cases occurring in specific venues (eg, high-risk congregate settings) and populations where benefits may be greatest. 20 This recommendation reflected both changes in the COVID-19 epidemic and the tools available to confront it, and the realization that universal contact tracing was not feasible when COVID-19 case numbers were very high. In this article, we describe the implementation of the Public Health-Seattle & King County (PHSKC) CI/CT program and evaluate its reach, timeliness, patient-reported impact on adherence to isolation guidelines, and provision of support services. Our experience can help inform decisions regarding how to adapt the CI/CT strategy in the current stage of the pandemic."

In consultation with and oversight from the Communicable Disease Epidemiology & Immunization Section, the PHSKC HIV/STD Section implemented and managed day-to-day operations of the COVID-19 CI/CT program. Starting with 6 members, the PHSKC CI/CT team expanded to its largest size by late November 2020, comprising 86 contact tracers, 1 medical officer, 3 managers, 3 epidemiologists, 1 trainer, and 2 administrative specialists; all but 8 were King County employees. Approximately 40% of contact tracers were bilingual in Spanish and English. Figure 1 visually depicts the PHSKC CI/CT model. Similar to PHSKC's approach to HIV surveillance and linkage to care, 21 the COVID-19 CI/CT program integrated service referrals into case and contact interviews. After initially seeking to speak with each adult in the household, the program shifted to communicating primarily with a single household point of contact to collect names, dates of birth, and testing and symptom status of each household member, discuss I&Q guidelines tailored to each household member, and coordinate support services. This approach was more acceptable to participants and time efficient than speaking with each household member individually. The following support services were offered to all households reached by the PHSKC CI/CT team: temporary housing and supervised care FIGURE 1 Depiction of COVID-19 Case Surveillance, Contact Tracing, and Response in King County, Washington, July 2020 to June 2021 a a After a patient underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, his or her specimen was sent to a laboratory for analysis. As a notifiable condition in Washington State, laboratories and health providers are legally required to report COVID-19 suspected or confirmed cases to local or state public health authorities along with the following information: dates corresponding to test order, specimen collection, and availability of test results; test result; ordering provider details; laboratory details; and patient date of birth, sex, and address. Laboratories typically submit this information through the Washington Electronic Laboratory Reporting System (WELRS). The WADOH manages WELRS, processes data received through it and other sources, and creates case reports in the Washington Disease Reporting System (WDRS) that are subsequently assigned to CI/CT teams across the state for investigation. During the case interview, PHSKC contact tracers collected the following information: language preference, race, ethnicity, and affiliation with an immigrant community; symptom status and onset; reason for testing; vaccination status; suspected source of infection; participation in WA Notify exposure notification; and detailed information about places recently visited, including worksites, schools, daycares, health care and behavioral health facilities, long-term care facilities, correctional facilities, airports and other modes of transportation, bars/restaurants, gyms, places of worship, salons and spas, and community and social events. This information was subsequently analyzed and summarized for the public, public health decision makers, and outbreak response teams. Cases were also asked to provide the names, dates of birth, and COVID-19 symptom and testing status of each person in their household, as well as other persons they had been within 6 ft for at least 15 minutes during their infectious period. Finally, PHSKC contact tracers discussed the I&Q guidance tailored to the household's circumstance, assessed need for clinical and support services, and referred to support services team accordingly. This figure is available in color online (www.JPHMP.com)."

Case investigation and contact tracing was acceptable to the population, with 82% of cases agreeing to be interviewed, a percentage that exceeds the weighted average reported in a study of 14 jurisdictions. 17 Our adoption of a prioritization strategy that utilized area-based demographic and socioeconomic indicators allowed our team to focus outreach on parts of the county most impacted by the pandemic with a CI/CT intervention model that emphasized integrated prevention education and service provision. The team facilitated the provision of groceries to more than 7000 households comprising more than 25 000 people, referred over 9000 households with more than 30 000 people for financial assistance, and helped more than 8000 people get COVID-19 testing and/or medical care. We believe that these services helped mitigate pandemic-related hardships. Moreover, two-thirds of End of I&Q Survey participants indicated that outreach from PHSKC following their COVID-19 diagnosis helped them adhere to isolation guidance, suggesting that our model of service may have decreased SARS-CoV-2 transmission, though we cannot estimate the number of infections averted by the intervention's effect on isolation."

These findings suggest that efforts to educate the public on what to do following a COVID-19 diagnosis had success, limiting the potential for CI/CT to further enhance prevention behaviors. Uptake of WA Notify exposure notification smartphone tool among cases interviewed by PHSKC was modest, and its impact is uncertain. A modeling study estimated that an adoption of 15% of a digital exposure notification app by King County residents could decrease total infections by 4% to 6% and total deaths by 2% to 7%. 24 Our ability to follow up with facility-level investigations based on information ascertained through CI/CT was limited owing largely to the overwhelming number of potential transmission venues identified during the case interview. Equipping a larger number of worksites, businesses, services sites, and other venues linked to a recent COVID-19 diagnosis with tools to minimize the risk of onward transmission might have expanded the reach and impact of the PHSKC CI/CT program."

Some studies suggest that infectiousness peaks around the time of symptom onset, while others suggest that infectiousness peaks up to 4 days later. 23 Variants that are highly infectious at an earlier stage of infection may diminish CI/CT impact in preventing onward transmission and necessitate very rapid provision of CI/CT. Similar to reports from other health departments, 6,17,25 PHSKC case interviews typically occurred 6 days following symptom onset, with symptomatic cases seeking testing 2 to 3 days after symptom onset. Test-seeking could potentially be expedited through increased accessibility of SARS-CoV-2 tests (particularly rapid tests), more widespread exposure notification, and promotion of test-seeking and home isolation as soon as one becomes aware of an exposure or symptom. The multistep process that occurs between specimen collection and case interview (ie, specimen transport and testing, surveillance data reporting and processing, and repeated call attempts to cases) was typically completed within 3 to 4 days with limited opportunity for acceleration. Other models of CI/CT (eg, provider-initiated CI/CT, digital CI/CT) could theoretically improve the timeliness of the intervention but carry other limitations, such as challenges with differentiating between new positives and repeat positive results, standardization of the intervention, and providing tailored I&Q counseling and referrals for support services."

            "text": "There are limitations of this evaluation. First, its generalizability is limited by its reliance on data collected from persons who completed PHSKC COVID-19 case interviews who are not representative of all King County COVID-19 cases. Also, the acceptability and impact of the PHSKC CI/CT program in June 2020 to July 2021 may not be generalizable to other jurisdictions with greater government mistrust or less capacity to provide CI/CT or support services, or to later stages in the pandemic with less support of and implementation of COVID-19 control strategies. Second, results from the End of I&Q Survey may be affected by nonresponse, recall, and social desirability biases. Third, we could not directly measure the impact of the PHSKC CI/CT program on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Although the End of I&Q Survey suggested that CI/CT facilitated compliance with isolation, we cannot definitively attribute improved I&Q adherence to CI/CT, nor can we estimate how much improved adherence might have prevented transmission. In addition, we did not attempt to implement backward contact tracing. However, given cases' limited willingness to name nonhousehold contacts encountered from 2 days prior to symptom onset to their date of interview, we are skeptical that elicitation of contacts using a longer contact period would meet substantial success. Finally, this evaluation did not report costs, an important factor in deciding how scarce public health resources should be allocated. 25 In conclusion, the integration of COVID-19 CI/CT with support services provided tens of thousands of households directly impacted by COVID-19 with prevention education and guidance, groceries, and referrals for financial assistance and other services, which likely improved cases' adherence with isolation guidelines and diminished the effects of the pandemic on disproportionately impacted communities. Despite this, the epidemiologic impact of the intervention is uncertain, and many and perhaps most people received CI/CT outreach after their period of greatest infectiousness. Whether CI/CT can be accelerated enough to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, particularly transmission of variants with short transmission intervals and high transmission probabilities in the period before symptom onset, is uncertain. The uncertainty needs to be weighed against CI/CT's demonstrated potential to mitigate the hardships that COVID-19 imposes on disproportionately affected and vulnerable populations."
