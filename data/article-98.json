            "text": "Mucormycosis is a lethal and life-threatening fungal infection. Several cases describing the association of COVID-19 and mucormycosis have been reported. In this article, we report a 58-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 who presented by diabetic ketoacidosis, rhino-orbital mucormycosis, and COVID-19. e patient was treated with liposomal amphotericin B and debridement of necrotic tissue of the rhino-orbital area and paranasal sinuses. Unfortunately, she passed away a few days after orbital surgery. We also conducted a review of the literature and reported 3 other similar cases that suffered from mucormycosis in association with COVID-19 and diabetic ketoacidosis and discussed the importance of this association."

Her past medical history included hypertension and poorly controlled insulin-dependent type 2 DM. On admission, physical examination showed a body temperature of 37.5\u00b0c (orally), pulse rate of 90 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 25 breaths/minute, blood pressure of 140/ 90 mmHg, and a room-air arterial oxygen saturation of 94% (by finger pulse-oximetry). In addition, unilateral swelling, erythema, and facial tenderness in the right side together with right eye proptosis were detected. e patient's right eye had no light perception and no pupillary light reflex. Neurologic examination was also suggestive of the involvement of the 3 rd , 4 th , and 6 th cranial nerves. According to the patient's clinical scenario and the presence of hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis, she was diagnosed as a case of diabetic ketoacidosis, and treatment with intravenous fluid and insulin was started."

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 was present in only one case. DKA was present in all of these cases. ree cases died, and one case survived."

Physicians should consider COVID-19 and its therapies not only as a risk factor of DKA but also for concomitant mucormycosis infection."
