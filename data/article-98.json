In this article, we report a 58-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 who presented by diabetic ketoacidosis, rhino-orbital mucormycosis, and COVID-19. e patient was treated with liposomal amphotericin B and debridement of necrotic tissue of the rhino-orbital area and paranasal sinuses. Unfortunately, she passed away a few days after orbital surgery. We also conducted a review of the literature and reported 3 other similar cases that suffered from mucormycosis in association with COVID-19 and diabetic ketoacidosis and discussed the importance of this association."

Neurologic examination was also suggestive of the involvement of the 3 rd , 4 th , and 6 th cranial nerves.

DKA is a potential lethal acute complication of DM that occurs as a result of insulin deficiency and production of ketone bodies [12, 13] . Insulin deficiency occurs more often in DM type 1 [12] . Our literature review showed several cases of DKA that were precipitated by COVID-19. Some of them reported no prior history of DM [13] , and some others had a history of type 2 DM [12] . e serum level of interleukin 6 (IL6) increases in both DKA and COVID-19 and can be used as a prognostic factor [13, 14] . e interaction between COVID-19 and the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) might be another mechanism that induces DKA in COVID-19 patients [13, 15] . Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an important and necessary enzyme in RAAS that catalyzes angiotensin type 2 to angiotensin type 1 and is highly expressed in the pancreas and lungs. It works as an entry point for COVID-19, and after endocytosis of the SARS-CoV-2 virus complex, the expression of ACE2 is reduced [13, 15, 16] ."

On the other hand, reduced expression of ACE2 after virus entry can prevent insulin secretion [13, 18] . ese two factors might have a role in worsening of pancreatic beta cell function and the presence of DKA in our patient. Of the four cases reported thus far (including the index case), two cases were from the United States, one was from Mexico, and the other one (index case) was from Iran. e median age was 38.5 (24 to 58) years. Two of the cases had previously diagnosed DM, but in two other cases, DM was previously undiagnosed. ree of the cases were female, and only one was male. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 was present in only one case. DKA was present in all of these cases. ree cases died, and one case survived."
