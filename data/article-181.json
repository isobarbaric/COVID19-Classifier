Second, the larger the size of the company, the higher the probability that employees would work for companies that introduced remote work after COVID-19. Third, according to the analysis by industry, the difference in remote work utilization between large corporations and SMEs was relatively small because of a similar working method in manufacturing."

This study examined the system and factors of labor-management relations contributing to such polarization and presented policy directions for the current labor market structure."

To this end, aims of this study were: (1) to check whether the use of remote work had increased since the outbreak of COVID-19; (2) to determine whether there was a difference in the use of remote work after the outbreak of COVID-19, focusing on the size of the company; and (3) to determine whether there was a difference in the use of remote work after the outbreak of COVID-19, focusing on dividing the industry into manufacturing and service. A primary sector (large corporations) was defined when the number of employees was more than 300. A secondary sector (SMEs) was defined if the number of employees was <300. Based on research results, the use of remote work amidst the pandemic was confirmed, with a focus on the dual labor market structure. Also, manufacturing and service industries differ in their working methods. Therefore, results were analyzed by taking the type of industry into consideration."

In most countries, work from home has been largely induced by the coronavirus pandemic. Nevertheless, although the OECD has cited the advantages of working from home as a response to the pandemic, in reality, its use has been confined to only a limited number of workers. In fact, in the UK and Europe, prior to COVID-19, remote work was only allowed to high-paying employees such as managers, professionals, public administrators, and other senior business staff (15) . In contrast, after the pandemic, low-income workers are more likely to lose their jobs because they are ill prepared for remote work and are pessimistic about continuing earning income through remote work, whereas people in high-income positions are 50% more likely to work remotely (16) . Furthermore, the COVID-19 crisis is prompting employers to extend remote working opportunities where possible, leading to greater investment in remote work infrastructures, which could bring some long-term benefits. However, these measures would not help frontline workers who cannot work remotely and are more exposed to infection (17) . An International Monetary Fund Working Paper reported that after the COVID-19 outbreak, hiring was most severely hit in sectors where remote work is not possible, such as service sector jobs in hospitality and tourism industries. In addition, workers from industries where remote work is not affordable are more likely to earn lesser average income than those in other industries. Thus, overall, the pandemic would exacerbate income inequality in sectors where remote work is not possible (18) ."

Additionally the infection risk only increased for individuals who began working on-site after being laid-off (20) . In addition, some researchers analyzed the impact of increased remote work opportunities on the labor market in Italy during the pandemic, which has the lowest rate of remote work among the European countries.

Figure 1 was prepared using such data. The X axis represents the timeline from January 20, 2020, when the first COVID-19 case occurred in the country, to February 2020. The Y axis on the left indicates daily cases, while the y axis on the right refers to cumulative cases. The solid line shows the number of cases per day and the dashed line indicates the cumulative number of cases. Figure 1 confirmed that South Korea had three massive outbreaks during this period. The first wave happened in February and March 2020, with viral spread due to large-scale religious gatherings in Daegu and Gyeongbuk areas attended by coronavirus-infected individuals who had previously visited China. During the first wave, people were afraid of being infected with Covid-19. Therefore, the South Korean government took strong measures such as a ban on movement between regions, social distancing, and remote work to nip the rapid spread of the contagion. At that time, companies began to introduce remote work. Owing to these efforts, by April 2020, cases dropped sharply. The world praised South Korea for its efforts to contain the pandemic. Nevertheless, the sudden adoption of the remote work system was ill-equipped to sustainably tackle the economic crisis at home and abroad. Therefore, many businesses eventually began to revert to an offline mode of work (23, 24) ."

Both sectors had a significant gap in their working conditions. The average monthly income of workers in the primary sector was 2.57 times that of the secondary sector workers. The primary sector workers worked about six times the number of years worked by secondary sector workers. The large wage gap between the two sectors can be attributed to difference in earnings to the pay-out between large corporations and SMEs as well as differences in their wage practices.

Figure 3 presents the proportion of salaried workers who have worked in companies with flexible work arrangements except for remote work. The share of workers using flexible work systems steadily increased from 4.7% in 2017 to 12.0% in 2020. That is, unlike Figures 2, 3 shows a steady increase in the proportion of salaried workers using flexible work arrangements regardless of COVID-19. Figure 3 shows that remote work among flexible work arrangements is heavily affected by COVID-19. Table 2 presents the annual statistics of salaried workers working for companies that implemented remote work. Specifically, it shows that among the salaried workers employed in companies with the remote work option, the share workers residing in dong (urban areas) exceeded that of salaried workers living in eup/myeon (rural areas). In 2020, regardless of the region, the share of salaried workers attending companies with remote work rose sharply; however, the share of 2020 relative to 2019 surged by about six times in dong (urban) areas, far outranking the increase in eup/myeon areas. There was no significant difference between male and female workers working in companies with the remote work option. Additionally, the higher the education level, the higher the share of workers with companies allowing remote work. In particular, the share of workers with the degree of Masters in remote-based roles rose to 6.9% in 2020. Meanwhile, on an average, during the survey period, only 0.5% of the workers who graduated from a technical college or lower were employed by companies that offered a remote work option. However, irrespective of the education levels, the share of workers with remote-based jobs rose by seven times during 2019 to 2020, showing the most prominent increase for all educational levels. In 2017, the share of employees working remotely did not vary significantly with marital status: unmarried persons 0.1%, married persons 0.3%, and the divorced/widowed 0.2%; however, in 2020, the share of both married and unmarried persons rose to 2.2% while that of divorced/widowed workers climbed to 0.5%, representing a substantial change."

The share of clerical workers in 2018 and 2019 showed a change from 0.4 and 0.6%, indicating less steady growth than the managers. However, the ratio showed a 6-fold increase from 2019 to 2020. In terms of industry type, the share of remote workers was higher in finance, insurance, real estate, public social service, personal service, and others. Sectors such as finance, insurance, real estate, transportation/communication, public social service, personal service, and others showed a sharp increase in the share of workers working remotely from 2019 to 2020. The size of companies was found to be positively related to the share of workers engaged in remote work. The share for companies with 1-4 employees was 0.2%, 5-29 employees was 0.5%, 30-299 employees was 1.0%, and those with 300 plus employees was 1.9%. Large companies employing more than 300 workers saw the share of workers engaging in remote work soaring by ten times from 0.6% in 2019 to 6% in 2020. Figure 4 shows the trends for the share of salaried workers working in companies implementing remote work by firm size and year, based on data from Table 2 . The X axis indicates the year, and the Y axis indicates the share of salaried workers working in companies with remote work opportunity. The dotted line with a triangle marker indicates the share of salaried workers working in companies with 1-4 employees. The dashed line with a diamond marker represents firms with 5-29 employees, the dash-dotted line with an X marker indicates firms with 30-299 employees, and the solid line with a circle marker shows the share of workers attending large companies with over 300 employees. Regardless of the number of employees, we found that the share of workers working from home steadily rose from 2017 to 2020. Notably the share in 2020 climbed sharply in proportion to the firm size. Table 3 presents the result of the analysis from considering \"whether the company where employee works used remote work\" as the dependent variable. The results were derived by using the Linear Probability Model, which included the variables likely to affect whether the companies introduced remote work. Results of Table 3 are similar to the results of the basic statistics in Table 2 . Specifically, regarding the personal characteristics variables, employees with a degree of Master are more likely to work for companies with remote work system by 1.09 percentage points."

Additionally, the coefficient of the correlation was prominent in year 2019 and 2020 and the probability of workers engaged in remote work was higher by 1.78 percentage points in 2020 than in 2017. Table 4 lists the results of the analysis of whether adoption of remote work by companies was influenced by firm size after the outbreak of the pandemic. That is, by checking the interaction term between the number of employees in a firm and the COVID-19 period variable, we measured the variation in the probability of introduction of remote work of the company after the COVID-19 depending on its number of employees. As in Table 3 , our analysis considered the dependent variable as a dummy variable with value 1 if companies with salaried workers provide remote work opportunities, and value 0 if not. The explanatory variables for personal characteristics and job characteristics of the employee remained the same as in Table 3 . We then measured the interaction effect of the number of employees in a firm and year variables using the year dummies."

Tables 5, 6 show results of analysis by dividing the sample into manufacturing and service industries. The manufacturing industry consisted of manufacturing, construction, and other manufacturing sectors. The service industry consisted of including wholesale and retail, food and accommodation, etc. The reason for analyzing samples by industry was because the working method differed depending on the industry. There were also differences in the utilization of remote work. In addition, even within the same industry, there were differences in working methods depending on the size of the company, which might affect the utilization of remote work. Table 5 shows whether there is a difference in the utilization of remote work after the outbreak of COVID-19 depending on the size of the company for workers (2) Statistically significant at significance level of ***1%, **5%, *10%."

It is difficult to introduce remote work except for some jobs in large corporations. In addition, SMEs are unlikely to use remote work because of limitations of their working methods and the vulnerable digital environment. According to results shown in Table 5 , only workers working for large corporations with more than 300 employees increased the probability of working in companies using remote work by 2.3 percentage point since the COVID-19 outbreak. The coefficient value was less than half that of Table 4 . Table 5 shows that the difference in remote work utilization between large corporations and SMEs is relatively small because of a similar working method. Unlike manufacturing, the service industry differs greatly in terms of working method between large corporations and SMEs. Large corporations operate mainly on-site services through outsourcing except for internal main management. Therefore, it is difficult for SMEs to use remote work compared to large corporations. Results of Table 6 showed that employees, regardless of the size of the company, increased the probability of working in companies using remote work. In addition, the larger the company, the more likely the remote work would be used by employees. However, due to differences in working methods, the probability of working for companies through remote work increased to 7.21 percentage point after the COVID-19 outbreak, widening the gap between employees of large corporations and employees of SMEs."

This conclusion stems from the variation in the level of remote work depending on the fluctuations of COVID-19 caseloads in South Korea. The decision to establish a remote work system is not expected to receive any opposition from the employees if it is implemented while keeping intact the current task assessment and remuneration schemes. However, the first challenge of allowing remote work is to devise methods to measures the work attitude and task performance of remote workers. Because of the difficulties in controlling their work status on a real-time basis while they work from home, companies would need to modify their performance assessment and compensation system. This would hardly be supported by employees because unlike a temporary use of remote work during the pandemic, a long-term system would involve a strict assessment of employees working status and performance, as well as wage reduction. Introducing a remote work system in South Korea involves two legal procedures. The first is to revise the collective agreement between companies and employees. Whether employees agree to the introduction of remote work proposed by employers would be determined by collective bargaining. Trade unions and employers may decide whether to introduce remote work after an adjustment of performance assessment and compensation system."

            "text": "The second procedure for introducing remote work involves an amendment to the employment rules. Employment rules are rules about working conditions unilaterally prescribed by employers in order to systematically and consistently control the working conditions of employees. According to the current laws, the employment rules cannot breach the provisions of a collective (37); however, unless a collective agreement specifically bans the use of remote work, the employment rules can be revised to introduce remote work. Meanwhile, in case the amendment of the employment rules is favorable to the employees, obtaining the consent of the trade unions or the majority of the employees is not necessary. However, if the employment rules are amended in a way that disadvantages the interests of the workers, the amendment must obtain the consent of the trade union or the majority of workers (38). For instance, if while establishing a remote work system the employers wish to impose a strict performance evaluation or wage adjustments that might deteriorate the current working conditions of the workers, the amendment would require the consent of the majority of workers. Furthermore, recently the Supreme Court of South Korea established a precedent that even after obtaining a majority consent, an amendment to the employment rule that puts workers at a disadvantage would have no effect for a certain worker unless a labor contract with the said individual worker is revised accordingly (Supreme Court, November 14, 2019, Sentence 2018 da 200709) (39). This implies that even if the introduction of remote work was decided through the difficult process of amending the employment rules, the use of remote work cannot be finalized in case the amendment requires an additional procedure of revising the labor contract with individual workers. This suggests that the current legal environment makes it difficult to introduce remote work at workplaces."

That is, due to the unique circumstances during the pandemic, companies implemented remote work without applying special procedures such as obtaining a majority consent of the workers. However, going forward, in the post-pandemic era, the continued use of remote work in the primary sector may not be easily accommodated by labor organizations if the existing performance assessment and remuneration schemes are modified."

For example, trade unions of large companies who have signed the union shop provision can make all eligible employees to become members of the trade unions. Hence, the high prevalence of trade unions within large primary sector companies in South Korea implies that companies cannot implement a remote work policy without a collective agreement that such a policy. Even when a collective agreement does not have a provision that prohibits the introduction of remote work, an amendment to the employment rules for the insertion of a remote work system requires the consent of the trade union or a majority votes of the workers. Therefore, with good cooperation between labor organizations and the management regarding corporate competitiveness and productivity is essential for the insertion of provisions on the use of remote work into collective agreement or employment rules. However, the negotiation culture between labor organizations and the management in South Korea has not been cooperative, so much so that the national competitiveness in terms of the labor-management relations is a major source of concern. In fact, among 140 countries, South Korea ranked 135th in 2016 and 2017, 124th in 2018, and 130th in 2019 in the labor-management relations assessment confirmed by the World Economic Forum (40) ."

Therefore, the secondary sector companies are more likely to consider introducing remote work through revision of the employment rules instead of collective bargaining. Even so, the introduction of remote work by amending the employment rules requires the consent of the majority of employees, which could pose a challenge. As mentioned earlier, even with the consent of the majority of the employees, if a concerned employee requires a revision of a labor contract, companies must make such a revision.
