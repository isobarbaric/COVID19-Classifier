            "text": "The immune checkpoints associated with the CTLA-4 and PD-1 pathways are critical modulators of immune activation. These pathways dampen the immune response by providing brakes on activated T cells, thereby ensuring more uniform and controlled immune reactions and avoiding immune hyper-responsiveness and autoimmunity. Cancer cells often exploit these regulatory controls through a variety of immune subversion mechanisms, which facilitate immune escape and tumor survival. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) effectively block negative regulatory signals, thereby augmenting immune attack and tumor killing. This process is a double-edged sword in which release of regulatory controls is felt to be responsible for both the therapeutic efficacy of ICI therapy and the driver of immune-related adverse events (IrAEs). These adverse immune reactions are common, typically low-grade and may affect virtually every organ system. In the early clinical trials, lung IrAEs were rarely described. However, with ever-expanding clinical applications and more complex ICI-containing regimens, lung events, in particular, pneumonitis, have become increasingly recognized. ICI-related lung injury is clinically distinct from other types of lung toxicity and may lead to death in advanced stage disease. Thus, knowledge regarding the key characteristics and optimal treatment of lung-IrAEs is critical to good outcomes. This review provides an overview of lung-IrAEs, including risk factors and epidemiology, as well as clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic features of ICI-related lung injury. Management principles for ICIrelated lung injury, including current consensus on steroid refractory pneumonitis and the use of other immune modulating agents in this setting are also highlighted."

            "text": "A growing wealth of evidence supports immune surveillance and immune tolerance as key players in cancer development and progression. These observations have led to renewed interest in developing strategies that harness endogenous immunity and tilt immune equilibrium in favor of enhanced tumor killing. One such strategy has been the exploitation of tumorassociated ligands and their corresponding inhibitory receptors on T cells, collectively known as immune checkpoints. Immune checkpoints associated with the CTLA-4 and PD-1 pathways are critical modulators of immune activation, both acting to dampen the immune response. Mutant cancer cells may effectively \"hijack\" immune checkpoint activation through PD-1 and CTLA-4 pathways, allowing tumor cells to evade normal immune surveillance and escape immune destruction by anti-tumor T lymphocytes. Recognition of PD-1 and CTLA-4 pathways as druggable targets in anticancer therapy has led to the successful launching of a new class of drugs, referred to as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Over the past decade, a rapidly evolving list of ICIs, including the CTLA-4 inhibitor, ipilimumab; the PD-1 inhibitors, nivolumab and pembrolizumab; and the PD-L1 inhibitors, atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab have been FDA-approved in the management of a variety of solid and hematologic malignancies. These agents represent a paradigm shift in which the T cell, rather than the cancer cell, represents the therapeutic target."

PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitor therapies confer a higher incidence of any grade pneumonitis (2.7-5%), as well as highgrade pneumonitis (0.8-2.0%), compared to CTLA-4 blocking agents (1.3% all grade, 0.3% high grade) when either approach is given as monotherapy [6, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Rates of pneumonitis are significantly increased with PD-1 or PD-L1 plus CTLA-4 inhibitor combinations, approaching 10% in some studies [6, 17, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] and Fig. 1 . Pneumonitis following combination therapy is often more severe, with slower recovery periods than with monotherapy [6, 23] . Details regarding the role of CTLA-4 inhibitors in augmenting the rate and severity of pneumonitis when given in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking agents have not been fully elucidated; however, clinicians should be aware of the significantly higher incidence of pneumonitis during combination therapy and patients should be closely monitored for associated signs and symptoms. In contrast to conventional chemotherapies and target therapies, ICI therapy may elicit durable effects and toxicities well beyond discontinuation of the drug, due to the induction of immunologic memory [27] . As a result, increased rates of pneumonitis following sequential PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4 monotherapies appear similar to pneumonitis rates when ICI combinations are given concomitantly (Fig. 1) ."

For example, the greater risk of pneumonitis with agents targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis may be due to activation of lung macrophages [28, 29] . Notable differences in the prevalence of pneumonitis have also been suggested within the PD-1/PD-L1 agent class, with higher rates of all grade, as well as high grade, pneumonitis reported in association with drugs that block the PD-1 axis compared to PD-L1 antagonists [22, 30] . However, other studies have not corroborated these observations [17] . Unlike CTLA-4-related pneumotoxicity, which appears to be dose-related, no associations between the appearance and severity of pneumonitis and the dose of PD-1/PD-L1 axis blocking agents have been reported [31, 32] ."

The driving forces for variations in the prevalence of pneumonitis among different tumor types are not fully understood. Existing tumor burden in the lung, prior lung irradiation, and co-morbidities, such as COPD among lung cancer patients, may limit the lung's tolerance to additional injury and explain the higher rates of pneumonitis in this group of patients [33, 34] . However, these co-morbid conditions may not be applicable for PD-1-treated patients with renal cancer, where the rates of pneumonitis are also high. Neo-antigen formation, the adaptive immune response, immune infiltrates, and the tumor microenvironment are all influenced by tumor histology and may offer additional explanations for the diversity of toxicity risk across different tumor types. Pre-existing fibrotic lung disease and a history of current or prior tobacco use have been implicated in the development of ICI-related pneumotoxicity, although details of these associations have yet to be defined clearly (Fig. 2) [17, 35] ."

Nonetheless, evidence from several small retrospective studies suggests that patients with pre-existing autoimmune disorders may be safely treated with ICI therapies. Severe and/or fatal pneumonitis in this setting has been reported rarely, thus underscoring the need for vigilance in carefully selecting and monitoring these patients [36] [37] [38] . Fatal IrAEs associated with severe graft versus host disease following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with hematologic malignancies who had been previously exposed to ICI therapies have raised concerns regarding the use of ICIs in this setting [39, 40] . These observations are concerning, particularly in the light of emerging evidence that supports the use of PD-1 inhibitors in the treatment of hematologic malignancies [41] [42] [43] . Several small case reports have also suggested that ICI therapy may be safe in selected patients with chronic viral illnesses, such as human immunodeficiency virus infection or hepatitis C [44, 45] . However, further prospective investigations are needed and the importance of multidisciplinary collaborations involving the oncologist, pulmonologist, liver, and infectious disease specialists cannot be over-emphasized. In several retrospective studies, ICI blockade in patients with pre-existing autoimmune disease elicited new IrAEs, transient flare-ups of preexisting autoimmune disease, or both. New IrAEs and disease exacerbations were mild in most cases, although rare cases of severe and fatal pneumonitis have been reported [36] [37] [38] 46] ."

Lung biopsies demonstrated interstitial inflammation and fibrosis, consistent with NSIP, which was thought to be due to Ipilimumab therapy or higher) pulmonary infiltrates to rule out alternative diagnoses. Systemic corticosteroids are the cornerstone of therapy in patients with pneumonitis grades 2 or higher and, thus, bronchoscopy to exclude an infectious etiology before initiation of steroid therapy is recommended. Patients with suspected pneumonitis grades 2 or higher are Culture and PCR analysis of BAL fluid should be performed to evaluate for infectious causes of pneumonia; however, negative cultures may not definitively exclude infection. Cellular analysis of bronchoscopically obtained lavage fluid may offer important clues to the diagnoses. For example, lymphocytosis, elevated eosinophils, and predominance of CD8-positive lymphocytosis are frequent findings on BAL fluid. However, similar findings may be observed with viral pneumonias, such as those caused by CMV, thus limiting the utility of cellular analysis in differentiating pneumonitis from infection. Transbronchial and surgically obtained lung biopsies may offer additional information, particularly in the setting of unexplained lymphadenopathy or suspicious lesions suggestive of underlying tumor progression. Impairment of diffusing capacity may be one of the earliest signals of lung injury and may precede clinical and radiographic findings. Thus, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) with measurement of spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide should be performed during the initial evaluation. Serial PFTs along with 6-min walk tests (6MWT) over the course of treatment may help to guide therapy."

These strategies are largely guided by pneumonitis grades based on CTCACE criteria. Withholding ICI therapy is recommended for all patients with suspected ICI-related pneumonitis, while the diagnostic work-up and treatment is underway. Patients with grade 1 pneumonitis may be monitored as outpatients. Chest CT imaging is recommended prior to the subsequent scheduled dose of ICI (within 3-4 weeks). If infiltrates have resolved, ICI therapy may be cautiously resumed with close follow-up. The addition of steroid therapy is recommended for pneumonitis grades 2 or higher. Patients with grade 2 pneumonitis can typically be treated as outpatients with oral prednisone, dosed at 1 mg/kg of ideal body weight/day. Drug re-challenge following resolution of infiltrates in carefully selected patients with grade 2 pneumonitis is also reasonable, with follow-up. In-patient management and permanent withdrawal of ICI therapy is recommended for all patients with grade 3-4 pneumonitis and patients with earlier-stage pneumonitis who demonstrate progression of toxicity despite drug cessation. Systemic steroids for this group of patients are typically initiated at 2 mg/kg of ideal body weight/day. As a general guide, we recommend continuing the initial dose of steroids over the ensuing 1-2 weeks, or until symptoms have returned to grade 1 (asymptomatic CT abnormalities), at which time, steroids may be slowly tapered. Pneumonitis flares may be more recalcitrant to therapy and have been reported following rapid steroid tapers. We, therefore, recommend a steroid tapering schedule over a minimum 4-6 weeks that is tailored to the severity of the pneumonitis event and response to initial therapy. Fig. 3 Organizing pneumonia following dual ipilimumab/nivolumab therapy. Progressive dyspnea and dry cough developed 3 weeks following cycle 3 of azacitadine plus nivolumab and ipilimumab for myelodysplastic syndrome. A chest CT demonstrated multifocal consolidative and ground glass opacities involving the right upper lobe (a) and bilateral lower lobes (b). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was culture negative. Prominent intraluminal plugs of inflammatory debris within the small airways were seen on lung biopsy, consistent with organizing pneumonia caused by combined Nivolumab/Ipilimumab therapy Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis Jeroveci pneumonia (PJP) in HIV-negative patients requiring prolonged, highdose steroid therapy remains a clinical challenge, as the dose of steroids that delimits \"high dose\" and the duration of steroids that defines \"prolonged\" have not been clearly established [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] . Adding to this conundrum is the fact that the predilection for PJP may vary among this patient population, rendering some patients, such as those with hematologic malignancies and those who have undergone stem cell and solid organ transplantation, more susceptible to PJP at relatively lower doses of steroids [54] . We, therefore, recommend PJP prophylaxis in our cancer patient population throughout the duration of systemic corticosteriod therapy. The addition of TNF-\u03b1 blocking agents may increase the susceptibility to serious infections, including tuberculosis [57, 58] . Accordingly, baseline testing for tuberculosis should be performed on all patients before initiating TNF-\u03b1 inhibiting agents. The need for gastrointestinal prophylaxis may also be appropriate in some patients undergoing prolonged steroid therapy."

A particular emphasis has been placed on in IrAE-pneumonitis, which may closely mimic SARs-CoV-2-related pneumonia. Assumptions that coinfection with SARs-CoV-2 during ICI therapy may lead to severe complications have generated concerns regarding adaptations in treatment, albeit without any reliable scientific evidence. In fact, in the TERAVOLT study which investigated the impact of severe SARs-CoV-2 infection on patients with thoracic cancers, the type of systemic therapy including immunotherapy did not confer an increase in mortality. However, the study was not sufficiently powered in subgroup analysis to render definitive statements regarding the safety of ICI therapy in this setting [76] . Concerns surrounding ICI therapies in patients with concurrent SARs-CoV-2 infection persist. The need to screen patients for SARs-CoV-2 prior to initiation of ICI therapy is highly debated, as infection status is typically unknown at the time that treatment decisions relating to the initiation of ICI and other cancer therapies are being made. Questions regarding what to do with ICI therapies that are ongoing at the time of SARs-CoV-2 diagnosis are even more challenging [77, 78] ."

Patients who develop respiratory symptoms or new pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of SARs-CoV-2 during ICI therapy should be immediately tested for the virus. Significant controversies arise for IR-pneumonitis grades 2 and higher, due in part to the attendant use of steroids in these patients. Corticosteroids represent cornerstone treatment in advanced-grade ICI-related pneumonitis, but may exacerbate respiratory sequelae of SARs-CoV-2, particularly those patients with mild disease that do not require oxygen supplementation [76, 78] . Thus, confirmation of SARs-CoV-2 with PCR testing is recommended before proceeding with corticosteroid therapy for IR-pneumonitis [78] . Bronchoscopic evaluation as part of the work-up for IR-pneumonitis in symptomatic patients with confirmed SARs-CoV-2 may facilitate viral transmission through aerosolization of respiratory droplets. We, therefore, avoid bronchoscopy in this setting, except in selected or exceptional cases."

Additional immunosuppressive therapeutic options, such as anti-IL-6 which has shown therapeutic efficacy in some patients with SARs-CoV-2, may be an effective treatment strategy in steroid-refractory pneumonitis. These preliminary recommendations are made within the context of the urgent need for evidence-based guidance and should be refined as prospective data emerge."

            "text": "ICI therapies have rapidly changed the landscape of cancer therapeutics and are currently used as standard of care for a broad range of refractory cancers. This class of drugs may trigger a spectrum of IrAEs which are generally well tolerated. Pneumonitis is less common than toxicities involving some other organ systems; however, lung injury represents a potentially lethal form of IrAEs and one of the most frequent causes of drug discontinuation. Currently, the burden of lung-related events associated with this class of drugs is low. The prevalence of pneumonitis will undoubtedly continue to grow in Fig. 5 Approach to management of ICI-related interstitial lung disease Support Care Cancer parallel with better recognition of this clinical entity coupled with the expanding indication of ICI therapies to other tumor types and the addition of these agents to complex treatment strategies that carry an additional toxicity risk. Healthcare workers providers must be aware of this emerging entity, as well as current management guidelines (Fig. 5) . Early recognition and vigorous diagnostic evaluations are key. Knowledge of the diverse clinical, pathologic, and radiographic presentations of IR-pneumonitis may inform patient management and lead to improved patient outcomes. Additional studies are needed to better elucidate risk factors and comorbidities that predispose to a higher risk of lung toxicity and to establish biomarkers that are predictive of lung injury."
