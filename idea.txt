plan for next week:
- split up data into testing, training set
    - in an 80-20 split
    - do this individually for scientific articles and conspiracy articles, then merge the two sets together
- after this, evaluation of well the system works with a ML model will be good
    - train model and redo-word frequency part once for the testing set and once for the training set (to prevent data leakage)
    - generate table for training and testing data (2 tables)
        - columns: for each of the 20 keywords
        - rows: count for each keyword in an article  
        - add a final column to the right displaying whether the article was a conspiracy or scientific (0 = conspiracy, 1 = scientific) 
    - train model with various different methods and evaluate test set
