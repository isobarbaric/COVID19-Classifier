       "  'text': 'Summary of data publicly reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Date: 5/3/23 [Note: We will be updating this report every month, depending on the continued availability of the data.] The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 vaccination for all children and adolescents 6 months of age and older who do not have contraindications using a vaccine authorized for use for their age. See AAP policy. In this report, drawing on data posted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of 5.3.23, the AAP reports progress in vaccinating US children, including the 50 States and District of Columbia. The report covers the vaccine data available for children 6 months-4 years, and the longer-term data for children 5-11 years and for children 12-17 years of age. See link below to download the full AAP report. Note: Individual state web sites may have additional or more recent information. Children Ages 6 Months-4 Years: As of May 3, 2023, the CDC recorded: 2.2 million US children ages 6 months-4 years have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine Representing 13% of 6 months-4 year-olds This past week about 7,000 received their first vaccine dose. About 14.9 million children 6 months-4 year-olds had yet to receive their first COVID-19 vaccine dose. Child vaccination rates vary widely across states, ranging from 3% to 45% receiving their first dose. Children Ages 5-11 Years: 11.2 million US children ages 5-11 have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine Representing 39% of 5-11 year-olds 9.2 million US children ages 5-11 completed the 2-dose vaccination series Representing 32% of 5-11 year-olds About 17.4 million children 5-11 had yet to receive their first COVID-19 vaccine dose. The past week about 6,000 received their first vaccine dose. Child vaccination rates vary widely across states, ranging from 17% to 83% receiving their first dose. Children Ages 12-17 Years: 17.9 million US children and adolescents ages 12- 17 have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine Representing 68% of 12-17 year-olds 15.3 million of US children and adolescents ages 12- 17 completed the 2-dose vaccination series Representing 59% of 12-17 year-olds About 8.3 million children 12-17 had yet to receive their first COVID-19 vaccine dose. The past week about 5,000 received their first vaccine dose. Child vaccination rates vary widely across states, ranging from 40% to 100% receiving their first dose. Portion of US Children who have received vaccination: Across the total of US children 6 mos to 17 years, approximately 56%, 40.5 million children, have not received a first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Source: AAP analysis of data series titled “COVID -19 Vaccinations in the United States, Jurisdiction” as of May 3, 2023. Data cover the 50 States and District of Columbia. There are 73.6 M children under age 18 in the US, 22% of the population (Census 2021). The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was approved by the CDC in persons aged > 16 years on December 12, 2020, following an EUA from the FDA on December 11th. On May 12, 2021, CDC approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in persons aged 12-15 years, following the vaccine’s EUA granted by the FDA on May 10th. The FDA issued an EUA for the Pfizer vaccine for kids aged 5 to 11 on 10.29.2021, followed by CDC recommendation on 11.2.2021. The FDA authorized the use of Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines for children 6 months-4 years on 6.15.2022, followed by CDC recommendation on 6.18.2022.

       "  'text': 'On May 11, 2023, the United States ended the Public Health Emergency (PHE) that was declared over three years ago to organize government resources and establish policies needed to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. After three years of weekly reporting on the number of child COVID-19 cases in the United States, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Children’s Hospital Association (CHA) will be sunsetting the weekly state COVID-19 reports. Origins of the Report The report was created in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic to measure how COVID-19 was affecting children in the United States. The CDC had begun providing national data on COVID-19 cases, but timely, regular data on pediatric cases were not available. Thus, we turned to data provided by states and territories and began to collect information from their web sites for the most current pediatric data. By compiling this information we could track the number of child cases weekly, as well as provide publicly reported case numbers for children at the state level. Changes in Data Available Over the past three years this report has provided a unique and valued resource to understand the impact of COVID-19 on children, and to understand trends in volume of cases and geography as COVID-19 variants emerged. The data in the report have always been limited by variations in how states categorized and reported COVID-19 cases. Beginning in 2022, as home COVID-19 tests became widely available, an increasing portion of COVID-19 cases were likely unreported. In 2023 an increasing number of states reduced the frequency of reporting and updating cases. As the end of the PHE approached, these trends intensified, and many states announced their posts were ending. We will continue to monitor COVID-19 with indicators that are available. However, given the decreasing access and reliability of data on the number of child COVID-19 infections, this weekly report was sunset May 11, 2023. We will continue disease surveillance as we do for other infectious diseases. Final Summary As of May 11, 2023, nearly 15.6 million children were reported to have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic according to available state reports. Over the past three years, the highest number of child cases reported in a week was over 1.1 million for the week ending January 20, 2022. Since the pandemic began, children represented 17.9% of total cumulated cases. The portion of reported cases that were children ranged from a low of 2.0% the week ending April 16, 2020 to a high of 28.9% the week ending September 9, 2021 (children, under age 18, make up 22.2% of the US population). On May 11, an additional 6,848 child COVID-19 cases were reported. Over the past 6 months, weekly reported child cases have plateaued at an average of about 24,000 cases, while in the past month the average reported weekly cases have dropped further to about 9,000. These trends parallel the pattern and decline that has been reported for adults. It remains important to address the long-lasting impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical, mental, and social well-being of this generation of children and youth. The AAP compiled a snapshot of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on families and provides resources to help pediatricians support them.
