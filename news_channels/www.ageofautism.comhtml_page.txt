With less stigma than in the past, suicides and cancer deaths are more readily described in newspaper reports.&#0160; <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/celebrity-deaths-in-2022-stars-weve-lost/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">US Magazine just posted and article about celebrity deaths.</a><br /><br />Just yesterday, 32 year old Canadian comedian <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/comedian-nick-nemeroff-dies-32-rcna35699" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nick Nemeroff died</a> suddenly in his sleep.

Justin Bieber has a disfigured face due to Ramsay Hunt Syndrome (a rare side effect of the Covid vaccine), and his beautiful young wife Hailey had a stroke.<br /><br />Correlation does not equal causation. We&#39;re not making light of any of these deaths or illnesses. I&#39;d like to see life insurance actuarial reports for the last several years. Have there been more deaths among people under 60, have the statistics changed? Insurers bet that you will NOT die, while you pay your premiums. Payouts are a problem. <br /><br />Age of Autism focuses on autism, but we branch into many topics.

Children wait years just for an evaluation to be classified as needing special help in school.</p>\r\n<p>The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cincreasing demand\xe2\x80\x9d is a regular feature in news coverage on special education in both Ireland and Britain.</p>\r\n<p>What do these stories tell us? Simple, there are more and more disabled children in these countries. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a secret. They keep telling us about it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Bedfordshire: </strong></p>\r\n<p><em>\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s more than 6,000 children in our mainstream schools on stage two of the SEND code of practice and around 3,000 with EHCPs\xe2\x80\xa6.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>CBC\xe2\x80\x99s director of children services Sarah-Jane Smedmor said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that demand for EHCPs double in the last few years.

Obviously, the Salk oral polio vaccine has not been in use for many years and his comparison is misleading and inappropriate , and we do not know why this product is preferred to the standard inactivated product (IPV).</strong></p>\r\n<p>This is a follow on to a UK Column Report last week with excellent analysis by retired nurse Debi Evans and News anchor Brian Gerrish which focused on the board meeting of the MHRA of Tuesday June 21. There were many disturbing features in the report which runs from 1.06.50 <a href="https://www.ukcolumn.org/video/uk-column-news-23rd-june-2022" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on the link</a>, but one really surprising fact which emerged - and I have been following the MHRA closely since at least 2004 - is that they combine purported role as a regulator of the biologics industry with developing its own biological products and trading with the industry: this happens through its subsidiary since 2013 the National Institute of Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) though it\xe2\x80\x99s &#0160;not immediately clear how long NIBSC has traded its own biological products.</p>\r\n<p>Of particular relevance is that coincidentally with this meeting a new polio scare was being launched in the UK - no one as of this present time has been diagnosed with polio but polio has been detected <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-61896411" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in a North East London sewer</a>. It is therefore fascinating to follow the conversation (which I have transcribed as best I can) between to the interim director of NIBSC, Mark Bailey, and Stephen Lightfoot, Chairman of MHRA (<a href="https://www.ukcolumn.org/video/uk-column-news-23rd-june-2022" rel="noopener" target="_blank">at 1.22.18</a>):</p>\r\n<p>Bailey:</p>\r\n<p><em>Significant investment by NIBSC and also its partners the Gates foundation and of course its&#0160;part of&#0160; &#0160;the WHO lab in (indecipherable) and of course basically premiere eradication. There are three strains of polio and the team at NIBSC developed three different vaccines. It happens&#0160;that strain two is the one that has been deployed most in clinical trials in Africa and it&#39;s listed product by the WHO which mean it can be used in emergency situations even though it is not proved. We are now moving to clinical trials with the other two strains as well, so it&#39;s very exciting: it&#39;s a huge huge combination: its effect is that this vaccine cannot revert. So the Salk vaccine which was used with most of us as kids there was always a low chance of it reverting back to wild type which means things like polio begins to appear in the population. This is a great leap forward here because it can&#39;t revert so basically its much safer.<br /></em></p>\r\n<p>Lightfoot:</p>\r\n<p><em>Again I think this is a great example of how the MHRA is different from other regulators around the world because we have NIBSC or National Institute for Biological&#0160;Standards and Control where do some basic looking at fundamental research and this is a good example of the work that we are doing in that area and the public health benefit it can have internationally and not just in the UK&#0160; so I think actually as regulator we&#39;ve got some really important you know constituent parts that actually make us a very strong and&#0160;capable organisation.</em></p>\r\n<p>The reality of this is if the MHRA ever was functionally a \xe2\x80\x9cregulator\xe2\x80\x9d it has abandoned this role to facilitate business, it even trades with industry in <a href="https://www.nibsc.org/products/brm_product_catalogue/sub_category_listing.aspx?category=Vaccines&amp;subcategory=Coronavirus+(V)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Coronavirus spike-protein</a>. This was emphasised in an earlier UK Column report when MHRA CEO June Raine excruciatingly discussed transforming the MHRA in 2020 from being \xe2\x80\x9ca regulator to an enabler\xe2\x80\x9d (<a href="https://www.ukcolumn.org/ukcolumn-news/uk-column-news-16th-june-2022" rel="noopener" target="_blank">at 47.30</a>). And of course it is a whole different level of concern if the MHRA not only received research funding <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mhra-awarded-over-980000-for-collaboration-with-the-bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation-and-the-world-health-organisation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">from the Gates Foundation</a> as has previously been identified but is actually in business with them (and the WHO). Of course, the pretext was that there was an emergency and this was in the most formal bureaucratic terms <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/the-british-government-the-world-health-organization-and-global-coup-of-2020.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an outright lie</a>.</p>\r\n\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t    <p class="entry-more-link font-entrybody"><a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/british-drug-regulator-mhra-develops-manufactures-and-sells-its-own-biological-products-including-va.html#more">Continue reading "British Drug Regulator (MHRA) Develops, Manufactures and Sells Its Own Biological Products Including Vaccines" &raquo;</a></p>\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<div class="entry-footer">\n          <p class="entry-footer-info font-entryfooter"><span class="post-footers">Posted by <a rel="author" href="https://profile.typepad.com/rescuepost">Age of Autism</a> on June 27, 2022 at 12:01 AM in <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/current_affairs/">Current Affairs</a>, <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/john-stone-uk/">John Stone</a>, <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/science/">Science</a>, <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/vaccines/">Vaccine Safety</a> </span> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="permalink" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/british-drug-regulator-mhra-develops-manufactures-and-sells-its-own-biological-products-including-va.html">Permalink</a>\n\n \n\t<span class="separator"> | </span>\n\t\n\t\t\t <a class="entry-comments" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/british-drug-regulator-mhra-develops-manufactures-and-sells-its-own-biological-products-including-va.html#comments">Comments (11)</a>\n\t\n\n\n          </p>\n\n\n          <!-- technorati tags -->\n\n\n\n          <!-- post footer links -->\n\t<p class="entry-footer-share entry-footer-share-buttons">\n\t\t<span class="entry-footer-links-twitter">\n     <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F06%2Fbritish-drug-regulator-mhra-develops-manufactures-and-sells-its-own-biological-products-including-va.html&text=" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-twitter"></i></a>\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-plusone"></span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-pinterest">\n     <a href="javascript:void((function()%7Bvar%20e=document.createElement(\'script\');e.setAttribute(\'type\',\'text/javascript\');e.setAttribute(\'charset\',\'UTF-8\');e.setAttribute(\'src\',\'https://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=\'+Math.random()*99999999);document.body.appendChild(e)%7D)());"><i class="icon fab fa-pinterest"></i></a>\n\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-facebook_like">\n     \n     <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F06%2Fbritish-drug-regulator-mhra-develops-manufactures-and-sells-its-own-biological-products-including-va.html" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-facebook"></i></a>\n     \n</span>\n\t</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n</article>\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n<!-- entry shared -->\n\n<article class="post entry">\n\n\n\n<!-- DISPLAY FULL POSTS-->\n\n     \n\n       <h2 class="entry-header font-entryheader">\n           \n        <span class="entry-title">\n<a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/pickles-pretzels-and-pop-tarts.html">Pickles, Pretzels and Pop Tarts</a>\n        </span>\n       </h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<div class="entry-body font-entrybody">\n\t\t\t\t<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e202a308d37bd8200c-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Snack graphic" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8357f3f2969e202a308d37bd8200c img-responsive" src="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e202a308d37bd8200c-250wi" style="width: 250px;

I didn\xe2\x80\x99t offer that last one to Ronan though.&#0160; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to share it.&#0160; I wanted it all for myself.&#0160; I don\xe2\x80\x99t usually do that; but that one night when I wanted just a little peace and quiet, I ate that last pickle.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>And I enjoyed it.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>The next day, after reading that memory, I could\xe2\x80\x99ve felt stabs of regret for not sharing.&#0160; But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.&#0160; That\xe2\x80\x99s because I had a brand new bottle of pickles ready for Ronan.&#0160; Seeing the new jar in the pantry reminded me of a shopping trip he and I took many years ago.&#0160; Outings these days aren\xe2\x80\x99t always successful for him, but that day all those years ago, with tons of patience and great communication, it was one of his best days\xe2\x80\xa6</p>\r\n<p><em>From another memory, written and shared with family, back in the spring of 2015\xe2\x80\xa6Enjoy!</em></p>\r\n<p>Ronan continues to be on a modified school schedule.&#0160; Lacking energy to sustain a full academic day, he only attends a few hours of school each week.&#0160; Since starting the modified schedule, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to do a lot of juggling. &#0160;Finding someone to watch Ronan during the day doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always work out, so he ends up accompanying me wherever I need to go.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>Errands are harder.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>Getting to appointments takes longer.</p>\r\n<p>Meetings take careful planning. &#0160;</p>\r\n<p>Since we\xe2\x80\x99re always hoping Ronan will gain more independence, I welcome the opportunity to bring him with me. &#0160;Most of the time, it works out well having Ronan tagalong to places he normally wouldn&#39;t go. &#0160;He gets to see his community during regular business hours.&#0160; He gets to learn and master new skills.&#0160; He gets to interact with people and they with him. &#0160;</p>\r\n<p>As much as I\xe2\x80\x99d rather he could have the energy to be at school learning, he\xe2\x80\x99s been able to learn valuable lessons when we go out. &#0160;Some simple things he\xe2\x80\x99s had to learn over the last year include:</p>\r\n<p>-Learning how to walk calmly to the car when prompted (instead of acting out because he wanted to stay home and watch more YouTube videos).</p>\r\n<p>-Staying buckled in the car seat (instead of attempting to wiggle out because we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get more French fries).</p>\r\n<p>-Keeping shoes (and clothes) on while we shop (instead of taking them off when things didn\xe2\x80\x99t go as planned).</p>\r\n<p>-Keeping shoes on while we\xe2\x80\x99re in the car (instead of throwing them at Mommy while she\xe2\x80\x99s driving).</p>\r\n<p>-Resisting a meltdown and remaining calm (<a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2014/06/a-typical-birthday-turned-terribly-wrong.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">instead of thrashing about on the floor</a> as has happened before).&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>-Using appropriate communication (instead of pulling Mommy\xe2\x80\x99s hair when we went down the \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d grocery store aisle).</p>\r\n<p>Being able to learn those simple things has helped when we go out and about, but Ronan still has lots yet to learn.&#0160; I do as well.&#0160; I need to plan my time better so that I\xe2\x80\x99m not rushing Ronan into situations he\xe2\x80\x99s not comfortable.&#0160; I need to prepare the environment better as well as prepare those who will interact with Ronan.&#0160; For instance, when Ronan must accompany me to a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s appointment that I\xe2\x80\x99ve scheduled for myself, I should remember to show Ronan a picture of where we\xe2\x80\x99re going or at least drive by the place with him one time before we actually need to go in it.&#0160; I should also let the provider know that my visit may take a few minutes longer than usual.&#0160; That\xe2\x80\x99s because Ronan\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity, as well as his anxiety and his sensory issues, can prevent a smooth transition into (or out of) the parking lot\xe2\x80\xa6the waiting room\xe2\x80\xa6the exam room\xe2\x80\xa6or meeting room that we\xe2\x80\x99re going into. &#0160;I need to remember that sometimes things will take longer. &#0160;That things won&#39;t go as planned. That we are that try, try, try, try one more time family. &#0160;I also need to remember one more thing. </p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t    <p class="entry-more-link font-entrybody"><a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/pickles-pretzels-and-pop-tarts.html#more">Continue reading "Pickles, Pretzels and Pop Tarts" &raquo;</a></p>\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<div class="entry-footer">\n          <p class="entry-footer-info font-entryfooter"><span class="post-footers">Posted by <a rel="author" href="https://profile.typepad.com/rescuepost">Age of Autism</a> on June 26, 2022 at 06:00 AM in <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/cathy-jameson/">Cathy Jameson</a> </span> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="permalink" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/pickles-pretzels-and-pop-tarts.html">Permalink</a>\n\n \n\t<span class="separator"> | </span>\n\t\n\t\t\t <a class="entry-comments" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/pickles-pretzels-and-pop-tarts.html#comments">Comments (4)</a>\n\t\n\n\n          </p>\n\n\n          <!-- technorati tags -->\n\n\n\n          <!-- post footer links -->\n\t<p class="entry-footer-share entry-footer-share-buttons">\n\t\t<span class="entry-footer-links-twitter">\n     <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F06%2Fpickles-pretzels-and-pop-tarts.html&text=Pickles%2C%20Pretzels%20and%20Pop%20Tarts" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-twitter"></i></a>\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-plusone"></span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-pinterest">\n     <a href="javascript:void((function()%7Bvar%20e=document.createElement(\'script\');e.setAttribute(\'type\',\'text/javascript\');e.setAttribute(\'charset\',\'UTF-8\');e.setAttribute(\'src\',\'https://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=\'+Math.random()*99999999);document.body.appendChild(e)%7D)());"><i class="icon fab fa-pinterest"></i></a>\n\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-facebook_like">\n     \n     <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F06%2Fpickles-pretzels-and-pop-tarts.html" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-facebook"></i></a>\n     \n</span>\n\t</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n</article>\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n<!-- entry shared -->\n\n<article class="post entry">\n\n\n\n<!-- DISPLAY FULL POSTS-->\n\n     \n\n       <h2 class="entry-header font-entryheader">\n           \n        <span class="entry-title">\n<a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/required-viewing-like-its-1974.html">Required Viewing - Like It\'s 1974</a>\n        </span>\n       </h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<div class="entry-body font-entrybody">\n\t\t\t\t<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e202a30d40c14a200b-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Free_to_Be..._You_and_Me_(album_cover)" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8357f3f2969e202a30d40c14a200b img-responsive" src="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e202a30d40c14a200b-250wi" style="width: 250px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Free_to_Be..._You_and_Me_(album_cover)" /></a>A year ago, Americans lost their jobs and their right to attend restaurants, concerts, sporting events and other activities if they did NOT choose the Covid vaccine.&#0160; Americans did not have the right to say no, which is a choice. Yesterday, we had another version of change in choice with the SCOTUS decision on Roe v. Wade. The right to say yes was affected. The divisions between Americans are growing by the minute. Up is down. Left is right. Right is middle. Middle is long gone. Imagine my surprise when my daughter started listening to a single song on YouTube, a song I hadn&#39;t heard in many years. Free To Be You and Me. The song debuted with a book and full album in 1974 as a way to bring Americans TOGETHER in understanding and acceptance. Back in those days, the topics were &quot;simpler.&quot; Black, white, boys and girls. End racism. End sexism. Seems quaint by today&#39;s complicated standards. But I think that Free To Be You And Me has more value then ever. As a look back, it shows we could and did make progress. As a look today, it shows we still need more. One group near and dear to our hearts, has been left behind in the society of free choice - those who chose not and/or are unable to vaccinate per the CDC guidelines. If medical choice matters, it has to matter from all sides, does it not?&#0160; If you&#39;ve never watched Free to Be You And Me - or listened to the lyrics of each star-studded song, I encourage you to take trip back to 1974. <br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><em>Free to Be... You and Me is a children&#39;s entertainment project, conceived, created and executive-produced by actress and author Marlo Thomas. Produced in collaboration with the Ms. Foundation for Women,[1] it was a record album and illustrated book first released in November 1972 featuring songs and stories sung or told by celebrities of the day (credited as &quot;Marlo Thomas and Friends&quot;) including Alan Alda, Rosey Grier, Cicely Tyson, Carol Channing, Michael Jackson, Roberta Flack, Shirley Jones, Jack Cassidy, and Diana Ross. An ABC television special, also created by Thomas, using poetry, songs, and sketches, followed two years later in March 1974. The basic concept was to encourage post-1960s gender neutrality, saluting values such as individuality, tolerance, and comfort with one&#39;s identity. A major thematic message is that anyone\xe2\x80\x94whether a boy or a girl\xe2\x80\x94can achieve anything.</em></p>\r\n<p><br /><br /><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7PS3nOcLbHI" title="YouTube video player" width="460"></iframe></p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<div class="entry-footer">\n          <p class="entry-footer-info font-entryfooter"><span class="post-footers">Posted by <a rel="author" href="https://profile.typepad.com/rescuepost">Age of Autism</a> on June 25, 2022 at 06:00 AM in <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/parents_corner/">Dreams</a> </span> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="permalink" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/required-viewing-like-its-1974.html">Permalink</a>\n\n \n\t<span class="separator"> | </span>\n\t\n\t\t\t <a class="entry-comments" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/required-viewing-like-its-1974.html#comments">Comments (10)</a>\n\t\n\n\n          </p>\n\n\n          <!-- technorati tags -->\n\n\n\n          <!-- post footer links -->\n\t<p class="entry-footer-share entry-footer-share-buttons">\n\t\t<span class="entry-footer-links-twitter">\n     <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F06%2Frequired-viewing-like-its-1974.html&text=Required%20Viewing%20-%20Like%20It\'s%201974" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-twitter"></i></a>\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-plusone"></span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-pinterest">\n     <a href="javascript:void((function()%7Bvar%20e=document.createElement(\'script\');e.setAttribute(\'type\',\'text/javascript\');e.setAttribute(\'charset\',\'UTF-8\');e.setAttribute(\'src\',\'https://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=\'+Math.random()*99999999);document.body.appendChild(e)%7D)());"><i class="icon fab fa-pinterest"></i></a>\n\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-facebook_like">\n     \n     <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F06%2Frequired-viewing-like-its-1974.html" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-facebook"></i></a>\n     \n</span>\n\t</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n</article>\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- entry shared -->\n\n<article class="post entry">\n\n\n\n<!-- DISPLAY FULL POSTS-->\n\n     \n\n       <h2 class="entry-header font-entryheader">\n           \n        <span class="entry-title">\n<a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/action-alert-let-people-with-disabilities-on-ssi-have-10000-in-assets-.html">Action Alert: Let People with Disabilities on SSI Have $10,000 in Assets </a>\n        </span>\n       </h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<div class="entry-body font-entrybody">\n\t\t\t\t<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e202a2eec94107200d-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Action alert" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8357f3f2969e202a2eec94107200d img-responsive" src="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e202a2eec94107200d-115wi" style="width: 102px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Action alert" /></a>Note: Below is an action alert from the ARC, and it&#39;s super important for those of us whose children are adults on SSI - Supplemental Security Income.&#0160; Since 1989, the asset limit has been $2000. There&#39;s a bill to increase that to $10,000 so that individuals like my own daughters can have some money set aside for emergencies. No one can live on SSI - certainly not in 2022. And everyone needs an emergency fund. Parents have been supplementing SSI forever. My daughters couldn&#39;t live here in Connecticut and pay rent, utilities, food, clothing, etc. even with their COMBINED SSI.&#0160; They live with me, their unpaid Group Home Manager and 3 shift support staff.&#0160; Uncle Sam is USING parents to foot the bill. And telling them they CAN NOT save a dime over $2000 for their future needs. <br /><br /><a href="https://action.thearc.org/VynIJ0a?p2asource=email-062422" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CLICK HERE TO SEND THE ALERT</a><br /><br />###<br /><br /><strong>Tell Congress: Support the SSI Savings Penalty Elimination Act NOW!</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides critical support for millions of people with disabilities to be able to afford necessities like food and rent. But it has many rules that make it hard for people to save money and get out of poverty. SSI has an asset limit that has not been updated since 1989. Assets include money in bank accounts, retirement accounts, and savings. Right now, people who get SSI can only have $2,000 in assets.

The Autism Treatment Network is, as&#0160; my dear old Dad used to say, &quot;Like the sleeves off their vest.&quot; Or my favorite, &quot;Like a fish needs a bicycle.&quot; Useless.&#0160; Katie Wright details the travesty - well funded, back pats galore, fully employed professionals, University cred, all while individuals suffer and families slip deeper into debt, despair and doubt.<br /><br />###<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p>&#0160;The Autism Speaks Treatment Network is an embarrassment.</p>\r\n<p>In twelve years of its existence, ATN received tens of millions of taxpayer dollars and accomplished virtually nothing. ATN gives new meaning to setting a low bar in autism research.We know how low the bar is, so that&#39;s quite an accomplishment!&#0160; Autism Speaks and the NIH should cease funding wasteful project immediately.</p>\r\n<p>ATN was founded because autism families were having an impossible time finding medical care for their children. This is especially true regarding ASD kids with GI problems. In the waiting room of Christian\xe2\x80\x99s pediatric GI, I regularly meet parents from PA, OH, MD and other far away states. It should not be so difficult to find a GI who knows how to treat our kids.</p>\r\n<p>The NIH has yet to fund 1 ASD/GI clinical treatment study. ATN was created to fill that gap. They were supposed to do urgently needed medical treatment research. Treatment research, not just addressing GI problems, but autoimmune conditions, PANDAS, intractable seizures, etc\xe2\x80\xa6..</p>\r\n<p>However none of that happened. The director of ATN for twelve years, is, incredibly, a speech therapist! That says everything you need to know about ATN\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to helping medically affected autistic kids. The vast majority of ATN research is redundant, dated or useless, telling us what we already know.</p>\r\n<p>For 12 yrs ATN has researched ASD sleep problems behaviorally only!! This is inhumane. A friend took her son to their Vanderbilt sleep clinic and, of course, none of ATN\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctreatments,\xe2\x80\x9d basically sleep hygiene, worked.</p>\r\n<p>When behavioral interventions don\xe2\x80\x99t work for night wakefulness you must immediately look into biological causation of sleeplessness. In my son\xe2\x80\x99s cause it was an overgrowth of candida causing the sleep problems. The rashes are a giveaway. Elimination of sugar, simple carbs and a round of antifungals stopped this seemingly intractable problem. This problem was destroying my family. We had not sleep through the night for years. Other families should no longer be suffering this fate.</p>\r\n<p>ATN\xe2\x80\x99s GI research is basically give the kid Miralax! Ok, we did that in 2000! Since then we have learned that Miralax is incredibly toxic and should not be given to anyone under the age of 17! CHOP did a study exposing the fact that Miralax contains an excessive amount of arsenic!</p>\r\n<p>These are just some of the ridiculous ATN research you have financed:</p>\r\n<p>1)&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Causes of obesity in ASD kids. Guess what?? Bad food and lack of exercise!!</p>\r\n<p>2)&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Relationship between GI problems and stress! Yes! They are related!</p>\r\n<p>3)&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Association of repetitive behavior and sleeplessness. Helping no one and telling us what we already know.</p>\r\n<p>4)&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Communication deficits often associated with motor system deficits. Once again, research helping no one leading to nothing.</p>\r\n<p>5)&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Creatine deficiency in ASD kids. This was established almost 20 yrs ago.</p>\r\n<p>6)&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Parents of ASD kids suffer from chronic stress!! And grass is green!</p>\r\n<p>7)&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Caregiver education level and ASD child with sleep issues. I find this just plain insulting,</p>\r\n<p>8)&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Decreased Sound tolerance in ASD kids. NO!! Shocking</p>\r\n<p>9)&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Medical care and associations with depression. Who isn\xe2\x80\x99t depressed when they need medical help?</p>\r\n<p>11)&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Walking! Walking is a possible option for promoting exercise in obese ASD people. I mean, can you even believe this??</p>\r\n<p>12)&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Sex differences in repetitive behavior.

D.</p>\r\n<p>In my 53 years as a family doctor, I cared for a large number of children who were adversely affected by many different vaccinations, with diagnoses as varied as an average pediatric practice. &#0160;Yet they all reacted in closely similar fashion, hinting at something important in the nature of chronic disease, the great riddle that has confounded physicians since the earliest times. &#0160;My plan is to begin with a summary of my own clinical experience, together with pertinent findings in the scientific literature, and then explore the questions it raises about chronicity itself, a dysfunction that somehow manages to insinuate itself into our everyday physiology, achieves in effect a new &quot;normal&quot; of healthy and diseased modes co-existing side-by-side in place of the old, and resists cure by perpetuating itself over the lifetime.&#0160; With all that in mind, I&#39;ll finish with the COVID to bring everything up date, followed by a brief epilogue on the special vantage point of clinical practice.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Chronic disease is everywhere.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Always a troubling enigma to physicians, chronic diseases have become so prevalent in in recent decades that they now command a preponderance of the time, space, and energy of most practicing physicians in the United States and the developed world<strong>.</strong>&#0160; As far back as 2008, the CDC surveyed the incidence of six prominent types in the United States -- diabetes, cardiovascular disease, COPD, asthma, cancer, and arthritis -- and found that</p>\r\n<p>60% of all adults had been diagnosed with 1 or more of them, as had</p>\r\n<p>78% of those 55 and older, and</p>\r\n<p>85.6% of those 65 and older,</p>\r\n<p>and that</p>\r\n<p>40% of all adults had been diagnosed with 2 or more, as had</p>\r\n<p>47% of those 55 and older, and</p>\r\n<p>56% of those 65 and older.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Since then, the fractions of our population affected by the most common ones have been estimated as follows, taking them one by one:<br /><br />asthma, COPD, and chronic lung disease - 15% of all adults<sup>2,3</sup>&#0160;

The red, blue, yellow puzzle piece is considered discriminatory. Schools are overwhelmed with special education students, and severely behavioral students. It&#39;s not that teachers can&#39;t teach all of a sudden. The raw material, the kids, are not of the same neurological status, meaning quality. Tomorrow, it will start to get much worse.

We\xe2\x80\x99ve learned to accept and even celebrate the disorder.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Reality</strong></p>\r\n<p>With literally THOUSANDS of stories on the decline of children everywhere on my site, LossOfBrainTrust.com, <a href="https://www.lossofbraintrust.com/">https://www.lossofbraintrust.com/</a> it\xe2\x80\x99s an undisputable fact that autism or some other form of neurological damage has changed traditional childhood.</p>\r\n<p>(We call this damage by a lot of different names: autism, Aspergers, ADD, ADHD, OCD, speech, language and communication needs (SLCN), social/emotional disorder (SED), severe learning difficulties (SLD), and many more acronyms.)</p>\r\n<p>And it\xe2\x80\x99s getting worse right before our eyes. Something is happening to children\xe2\x80\x99s brains that make them unable to speak in many cases, unable to learn normally and unable to behave as children have always been expected to behave.</p>\r\n<p>We congratulate ourselves for recognizing the sorrowful condition of children and continually call for better detection and earlier intervention, as if those improvements would solve all the problems of dysfunctional children worldwide.</p>\r\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m in my sixth year posting stories on LossOfBrainTrust, yet clearly this is a disaster that goes unrecognized, even by the people involved. Officials keep funding more special ed classrooms and even whole schools, but it\xe2\x80\x99s never enough. We\xe2\x80\x99re constantly told that THERE ARE MORE DISABLED CHILDREN without even an attempt at an explanation for why it\xe2\x80\x99s happening.</p>\r\n<p>And kids are increasingly MORE SEVERELY DISABLED.

When I think back to when I first wanted to know more about vaccines, I think of the OG, the original voices who spoke up.&#0160; Those voices spoke for a growing many.&#0160; Their vaccine stories were heard in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09H6Gp-Y9XQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Washington, D.C. back in 1999</a>.&#0160; Parent-founded groups had <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/generation-rescue-ad-in-usa-today-court-again-concedes-vaccines-cause-autism.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lots to say back in the day</a> about it and were able to get their message in print, too.&#0160; Others <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3715598/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shared their plight</a> and other important information <a href="https://1986theact.com/watch/"></a> in more <a href="https://1986theact.com/watch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent documentaries</a>. &#0160;</p>\r\n<p>Fast forward to now, and a new generation of people want to talk about it.&#0160; They want what it\xe2\x80\x99s done to them and their livelihoods to be known for all to see.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>They join thousands of others who\xe2\x80\x99ve questioned vaccines after vaccine injury.&#0160; Those others have \xe2\x80\x98taken it to the streets\xe2\x80\x99 before and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnCall/story?id=4987758" rel="noopener" target="_blank">marched in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital</a>. &#0160; They\xe2\x80\x99ve caught the <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2008/06/post-1.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ear of influential people</a> who\xe2\x80\x99ve also offered to help the cause.&#0160; Over the years, moms headed to their own state capitals to rally the people. &#0160;From <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2015/04/laura-hayes-speech-on-parental-rights-and-medical-freedom-california-sb277-.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one side of the country</a> to <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2015/04/maine-national-town-hall-debate-on-vaccines.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the other</a>, moms got their message about it out there.&#0160; <a href="https://newjersey.news12.com/former-professional-fighter-says-vaccines-are-to-blame-for-sons-death-38999281" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dads</a> did, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXwUoI_0AWw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">too. </a></p>\r\n<p>It isn\xe2\x80\x99t just parents and patients who\xe2\x80\x99ve raised their voices and their concerns; some medical people were on the right side of truth and kept the conversation going as well.&#0160; They knew it was worth <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2015/06/dr-toni-bark-on-ca-sb277.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">talking about vaccines</a>.&#0160; But not enough people in the mainstream medical community want to warn that these liability-free medical products are risky.</p>\r\n<p>Instead, it remains the patient themselves, or their parents, to keep raising their voices about vaccines and vaccine injuries.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>The further we get back into real life with fewer restrictions, the less I hear some people talking about the covid vaccine.&#0160; Of course, certain others (mainstream news talking heads, corporate media, and Hollywood spokespeople) still can\xe2\x80\x99t say enough about it.&#0160; They insist that it\xe2\x80\x99s the only defense we have against the covid illness.&#0160; They believe it\xe2\x80\x99s the safest thing for you.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>People\xe2\x80\x99s personal stories say otherwise.</p>\r\n<p>So, can we talk about it, the covid vax?&#0160; Sure!&#0160; Yes!&#0160; Why not!&#0160; They are still under Emergency Use Authorized (EUA).&#0160; They are still causing a divide among families.&#0160; They all still come with potential risk, <a href="https://magneticmediatv.com/2022/06/novavax-approved-by-fda-in-covid-19-fight/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">even the new one</a> that the FDA <a href="https://magneticmediatv.com/2022/06/novavax-approved-by-fda-in-covid-19-fight/"></a> recently recommend for EUA. &#0160;</p>\r\n<p>Of course, we should talk about them, these covid vaccines.&#0160; We should because the propaganda has not waned.&#0160; The risks have not lessened.&#0160; And the side effects, ones known and ones yet to be discovered, are very real.</p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t    <p class="entry-more-link font-entrybody"><a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/canwetalkaboutit.html#more">Continue reading "#CanWeTalkAboutIt" &raquo;</a></p>\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<div class="entry-footer">\n          <p class="entry-footer-info font-entryfooter"><span class="post-footers">Posted by <a rel="author" href="https://profile.typepad.com/rescuepost">Age of Autism</a> on June 19, 2022 at 06:00 AM in <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/cathy-jameson/">Cathy Jameson</a> </span> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="permalink" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/canwetalkaboutit.html">Permalink</a>\n\n \n\t<span class="separator"> | </span>\n\t\n\t\t\t <a class="entry-comments" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/canwetalkaboutit.html#comments">Comments (5)</a>\n\t\n\n\n          </p>\n\n\n          <!-- technorati tags -->\n\n\n\n          <!-- post footer links -->\n\t<p class="entry-footer-share entry-footer-share-buttons">\n\t\t<span class="entry-footer-links-twitter">\n     <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F06%2Fcanwetalkaboutit.html&text=%23CanWeTalkAboutIt" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-twitter"></i></a>\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-plusone"></span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-pinterest">\n     <a href="javascript:void((function()%7Bvar%20e=document.createElement(\'script\');e.setAttribute(\'type\',\'text/javascript\');e.setAttribute(\'charset\',\'UTF-8\');e.setAttribute(\'src\',\'https://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=\'+Math.random()*99999999);document.body.appendChild(e)%7D)());"><i class="icon fab fa-pinterest"></i></a>\n\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-facebook_like">\n     \n     <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F06%2Fcanwetalkaboutit.html" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-facebook"></i></a>\n     \n</span>\n\t</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n</article>\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n<!-- entry shared -->\n\n<article class="post entry">\n\n\n\n<!-- DISPLAY FULL POSTS-->\n\n     \n\n       <h2 class="entry-header font-entryheader">\n           \n        <span class="entry-title">\n<a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/cardiology-theres-a-great-future-in-pediatric-cardiology-will-you-think-about-it.html">Cardiology.

The vaccine had been authorized for use in adults 18 years of age and older.<br />For the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, the FDA amended the EUA to include use of the vaccine in individuals 6 months through 4 years of age.

Since then, the use of prophylactic antibiotics given to laboring mothers has increased to more than <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/33/1/2/668235?login=true">30% of all deliveries in the United States</a>. However, this practice was implemented before our present-day and still emerging understanding of the microbiota\xe2\x80\x99s important role in many aspects of health. Recently, researchers at the MIND Institute published a study investigating the effect of antibiotics administered to pregnant mice on offspring gut microbiome composition and metabolic capabilities. The researchers also investigated how these microbiota changes can influence the offspring\xe2\x80\x99s immune responses. The study\xe2\x80\x99s design involved administering a broad-spectrum antibiotic orally to pregnant mice during late gestation through birth. Post-birth, bacterial DNA was taken from offspring fecal samples and was then sequenced and analyzed. The offspring\xe2\x80\x99s serum and brain tissue cytokine levels were also analyzed. The results showed that the antibiotic cocktail given to the pregnant mice produced significant diversity and taxonomic changes in their offspring\xe2\x80\x99s microbiome. Also altered in the offspring were genomic and metabolic pathways. Interestingly, an increased <em>Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes </em>(F/B) ratio was found in female offspring but not males. An increased F/B ratio is associated with dysbiosis and metabolic disorders. The MIND Institute researchers concluded that maternal antibiotic exposure could produce long-lasting effects on the offspring\xe2\x80\x99s gut microbiome and neuroimmune responses. They believe their findings demonstrate how important the role of the early microbiome is in the development of gastrointestinal and immune systems.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/5/1042/htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Original Study</a></p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<div class="entry-footer">\n          <p class="entry-footer-info font-entryfooter"><span class="post-footers">Posted by <a rel="author" href="https://profile.typepad.com/rescuepost">Age of Autism</a> on June 15, 2022 at 06:00 AM in <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/current_affairs/">Current Affairs</a>, <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/science/">Science</a> </span> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="permalink" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/gut-science-was-slower-than-a-colon-after-surgery.html">Permalink</a>\n\n \n\t<span class="separator"> | </span>\n\t\n\t\t\t <a class="entry-comments" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/gut-science-was-slower-than-a-colon-after-surgery.html#comments">Comments (5)</a>\n\t\n\n\n          </p>\n\n\n          <!-- technorati tags -->\n\n\n\n          <!-- post footer links -->\n\t<p class="entry-footer-share entry-footer-share-buttons">\n\t\t<span class="entry-footer-links-twitter">\n     <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F06%2Fgut-science-was-slower-than-a-colon-after-surgery.html&text=Gut%20Science%20Was%20Slower%20Than%20A%20Colon%20After%20Surgery" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-twitter"></i></a>\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-plusone"></span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-pinterest">\n     <a href="javascript:void((function()%7Bvar%20e=document.createElement(\'script\');e.setAttribute(\'type\',\'text/javascript\');e.setAttribute(\'charset\',\'UTF-8\');e.setAttribute(\'src\',\'https://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=\'+Math.random()*99999999);document.body.appendChild(e)%7D)());"><i class="icon fab fa-pinterest"></i></a>\n\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-facebook_like">\n     \n     <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F06%2Fgut-science-was-slower-than-a-colon-after-surgery.html" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-facebook"></i></a>\n     \n</span>\n\t</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n</article>\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n<!-- entry shared -->\n\n<article class="post entry">\n\n\n\n<!-- DISPLAY FULL POSTS-->\n\n     \n\n       <h2 class="entry-header font-entryheader">\n           \n        <span class="entry-title">\n<a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/many-infant-deaths-classified-as-sids-are-actually-caused-by-vaccines.html">Many Infant Deaths Classified as SIDS Are Actually Caused by Vaccines</a>\n        </span>\n       </h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<div class="entry-body font-entrybody">\n\t\t\t\t<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e202a30d3f1494200b-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Baby coffin" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8357f3f2969e202a30d3f1494200b img-responsive" src="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e202a30d3f1494200b-250wi" style="width: 250px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Baby coffin" /></a>Crib death. Cot death. SIDS has been a formal cause of death since 1969.&#0160; It&#39;s hard to imagine a deeper pain.

Healthy young people, not infants, dying of &quot;natural&quot; causes. As always, thank you to Dr. Gaunt for speaking out on behalf of pediatric health and wellness. <br /><br />By Dr. William H. Gaunt, NMD</p>\r\n<p><strong>What Is SIDS?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is defined as: \xe2\x80\x9cThe sudden death of an infant under one year of age which remains unexplained after a thorough case investigation, including performance of a complete autopsy, examination of the death scene, and review of the clinical history.\xe2\x80\x9d It is the leading cause of death in children between one month and one year of age. As we see in the definition, the cause of SIDS is unexplained or unknown. This classification is a convenient place to hide infant deaths caused by vaccines.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Before and After 1979</strong></p>\r\n<p>There are 130 official ways for an infant to die. These are listed in the International Classification of Diseases and are sanctioned by WHO and CDC. Before 1979, one of the possible causes of infant death was vaccines. After 1979, all cause-of-death classifications associated with vaccination were eliminated. (Thanks to Neil Z. Miller for this and other information used in this article. He published \xe2\x80\x9cVaccines and sudden infant death: An analysis of the VAERS database 1990-2019 and review of the medical literature\xe2\x80\x9d in PubMed Central Toxicology Reports on June 24th, 2021). Before 1979, a coroner could choose vaccines as the cause of an infant death if the evidence fit that conclusion. After 1979, vaccines were no longer one of the accepted causes of infant death and the coroner would be forced to choose another cause of death. SIDS would be a likely alternative choice. It is not a stretch to assume that the vaccine companies had a hand in eliminating vaccines as one of the accepted possible causes of infant deaths.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Infant Deaths Occur Far More Frequently Within 7 Days After Receiving Multiple Vaccines</strong></p>\r\n<p>The CDC vaccine schedule calls for the hepatitis B vaccine to be given on the day of birth. At 2 months, it calls for 8 vaccines (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DTaP), polio, hepatitis B, pneumococcal, haemophilus B, and rotovirus.) At 4 months, it calls for 7 vaccines (DTaP, polio, pneumoccal, haemophilus B, and rotovirus.) Then at 6 months there are 9 more vaccines on the schedule (DTaP, polio, hepatitis B, pneumococcal, haemophilus B, flu, and rotovirus). No worries that 7 to 9 vaccines given to an infant at one time might kill some infants. The authorities routinely exonerate the vaccines and encourage the selection of SIDS as the appropriate cause of these deaths. VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System) data shows that more than 78% of reported infant deaths occurred within the first 7 days post-vaccination. This does not prove that vaccines killed these infants, but it is highly suspicious.</p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t    <p class="entry-more-link font-entrybody"><a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/many-infant-deaths-classified-as-sids-are-actually-caused-by-vaccines.html#more">Continue reading "Many Infant Deaths Classified as SIDS Are Actually Caused by Vaccines" &raquo;</a></p>\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<div class="entry-footer">\n          <p class="entry-footer-info font-entryfooter"><span class="post-footers">Posted by <a rel="author" href="https://profile.typepad.com/rescuepost">Age of Autism</a> on June 14, 2022 at 06:00 AM in <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/current_affairs/">Current Affairs</a>, <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/vaccines/">Vaccine Safety</a> </span> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="permalink" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/many-infant-deaths-classified-as-sids-are-actually-caused-by-vaccines.html">Permalink</a>\n\n \n\t<span class="separator"> | </span>\n\t\n\t\t\t <a class="entry-comments" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/many-infant-deaths-classified-as-sids-are-actually-caused-by-vaccines.html#comments">Comments (11)</a>\n\t\n\n\n          </p>\n\n\n          <!-- technorati tags -->\n\n\n\n          <!-- post footer links -->\n\t<p class="entry-footer-share entry-footer-share-buttons">\n\t\t<span class="entry-footer-links-twitter">\n     <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F06%2Fmany-infant-deaths-classified-as-sids-are-actually-caused-by-vaccines.html&text=Many%20Infant%20Deaths%20Classif..." target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-twitter"></i></a>\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-plusone"></span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-pinterest">\n     <a href="javascript:void((function()%7Bvar%20e=document.createElement(\'script\');e.setAttribute(\'type\',\'text/javascript\');e.setAttribute(\'charset\',\'UTF-8\');e.setAttribute(\'src\',\'https://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=\'+Math.random()*99999999);document.body.appendChild(e)%7D)());"><i class="icon fab fa-pinterest"></i></a>\n\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-facebook_like">\n     \n     <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F06%2Fmany-infant-deaths-classified-as-sids-are-actually-caused-by-vaccines.html" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-facebook"></i></a>\n     \n</span>\n\t</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n</article>\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n<!-- entry shared -->\n\n<article class="post entry">\n\n\n\n<!-- DISPLAY FULL POSTS-->\n\n     \n\n       <h2 class="entry-header font-entryheader">\n           \n        <span class="entry-title">\n<a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/the-british-government-the-world-health-organization-and-global-coup-of-2020.html">The British Government, the World Health Organization and the Global Coup of 2020</a>\n        </span>\n       </h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<div class="entry-body font-entrybody">\n\t\t\t\t<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e202a308d178a3200c-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="UK lockdown" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8357f3f2969e202a308d178a3200c img-responsive" src="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e202a308d178a3200c-250wi" style="width: 250px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="UK lockdown" /></a>By John Stone</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>In March 2020 the British Government decided to impose lockdown on the determination of the WHO against the advice of its own medical experts including Sir Chris Whitty - the experts then followed the policy, subordinating their judgment to the outside agency. These events anticipated the WHO\xe2\x80\x99s recent and continuing attempts to formalise global supremacy in health, and demonstrates the arbitrariness and chaos which will inevitably follow&#0160;</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>I am trying to understand the events of March 2020 in the light of an answer to a recent Freedom of Information Request. Why and how was it that four days before lockdown was imposed on March 23 the four Chief Medical Officers of the United Kingdom posted a notice on-line announcing that COVID-19 had been downgraded <u>from</u> the status of High Consequence Infectious Disease (HCID).</p>\r\n<p>This peculiar event has not gone entirely un-noticed but has never really been explained. Before this point the disease named in the document &#0160;as COVID-19 (rather than &#0160;identified as virus SARS-CoV-2) - was a \xe2\x80\x9chigh consequence infectious disease\xe2\x80\x9d, while almost at the very instant our lives, and everyone\xe2\x80\x99s, &#0160;were to be irrevocably pitched into turmoil with the denial of civil liberties and most basic human rights, untold economic destruction and chaos, it was no longer so designated.</p>\r\n<p>If the disease was no longer \xe2\x80\x9chigh consequence\xe2\x80\x9d there could be absolutely no reason for this high level and prolonged disruption, and yet it was at this precise moment that the inevitability of lockdown started to be promoted, only to be confirmed four days later. But according to the CMOs\xe2\x80\x99 reckoning at no point in the past two and a quarter years, whatever actions they took to restrict our lives or coerce us to accept injections of novel products, has the disease been \xe2\x80\x9chigh consequence\xe2\x80\x9d.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>This anomaly cannot I believe be stressed enough: my FOI request produced no new documents but the Department of Health and Social Care drew my attention to <a href="https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-questions/detail/2020-09-28/95975" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Parliamentary answer by Jo Churchill on November 6, &#0160;2020</a>&#0160;to Conservative MP John Redwood (submitted fully 5 and a half weeks before on September 28):</p>\r\n<p><em>The four nations public health high consequence infectious disease (HCID) group made an interim recommendation in January 2020 to classify COVID-19 as an HCID, based on the information that was available during the very early stages of the outbreak.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Once more was known about COVID-19, United Kingdom public health bodies reviewed the available information against the HCID criteria and noted certain changes. These changes included the increase in information available about mortality rates, which are low overall amongst the general population; greater clinical awareness; and the availability of a specific and sensitive laboratory test for the virus.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>COVID-19 has not been considered a HCID in the UK since 19 March 2020, but this reclassification has not affected the Government\xe2\x80\x99s response to COVID-19, which remains a comprehensive national effort.</em></p>\r\n<p>So, the junior minister, Jo Churchill, confirmed that decision was made with due consideration and not because of some expedience: this remained the case on November 6, 2020, and remains the case today because whatever the CMOs have said subsequently to the public, notably government Chief Medical Officer Sir Chris Whitty they have not updated this statement.</p>\r\n<p>With this in mind let us go back and look at what was said <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/high-consequence-infectious-diseases-hcid" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in the statement of March 19, 2020</a>&#0160;:it may be one of those occasions when British government documents are more revealing than most.</p>\r\n<p><em>As of 19 March 2020, COVID-19 is no longer considered to be a high consequence infectious disease (HCID) in the UK. There are many diseases which can cause serious illness which are not classified as HCIDs.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>The 4 nations public health HCID group made an interim recommendation in January 2020 to classify COVID-19 as an HCID. This was based on consideration of the UK HCID criteria about the virus and the disease with information available during the early stages of the outbreak. Now that more is known about COVID-19, the public health bodies in the UK have reviewed the most up to date information about COVID-19 against the UK HCID criteria. They have determined that several features have now changed; in particular, more information is available about mortality rates (low overall), and there is now greater clinical awareness and a specific and sensitive laboratory test, the availability of which continues to increase.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>The Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) is also of the opinion that COVID-19 should no longer be classified as an HCID.</em></p>\r\n\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t    <p class="entry-more-link font-entrybody"><a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/the-british-government-the-world-health-organization-and-global-coup-of-2020.html#more">Continue reading "The British Government, the World Health Organization and the Global Coup of 2020" &raquo;</a></p>\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<div class="entry-footer">\n          <p class="entry-footer-info font-entryfooter"><span class="post-footers">Posted by <a rel="author" href="https://profile.typepad.com/rescuepost">Age of Autism</a> on June 13, 2022 at 01:00 AM in <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/current_affairs/">Current Affairs</a>, <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/john-stone-uk/">John Stone</a>, <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/science/">Science</a>, <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/vaccines/">Vaccine Safety</a> </span> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="permalink" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/the-british-government-the-world-health-organization-and-global-coup-of-2020.html">Permalink</a>\n\n \n\t<span class="separator"> | </span>\n\t\n\t\t\t <a class="entry-comments" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/the-british-government-the-world-health-organization-and-global-coup-of-2020.html#comments">Comments (19)</a>\n\t\n\n\n          </p>\n\n\n          <!-- technorati tags -->\n\n\n\n          <!-- post footer links -->\n\t<p class="entry-footer-share entry-footer-share-buttons">\n\t\t<span class="entry-footer-links-twitter">\n     <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F06%2Fthe-british-government-the-world-health-organization-and-global-coup-of-2020.html&text=The%20British%20Governm..." target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-twitter"></i></a>\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-plusone"></span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-pinterest">\n     <a href="javascript:void((function()%7Bvar%20e=document.createElement(\'script\');e.setAttribute(\'type\',\'text/javascript\');e.setAttribute(\'charset\',\'UTF-8\');e.setAttribute(\'src\',\'https://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=\'+Math.random()*99999999);document.body.appendChild(e)%7D)());"><i class="icon fab fa-pinterest"></i></a>\n\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-facebook_like">\n     \n     <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F06%2Fthe-british-government-the-world-health-organization-and-global-coup-of-2020.html" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-facebook"></i></a>\n     \n</span>\n\t</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n</article>\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n<!-- entry shared -->\n\n<article class="post entry">\n\n\n\n<!-- DISPLAY FULL POSTS-->\n\n     \n\n       <h2 class="entry-header font-entryheader">\n           \n        <span class="entry-title">\n<a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/type-it-out.html">Type It Out</a>\n        </span>\n       </h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<div class="entry-body font-entrybody">\n\t\t\t\t<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e202a2eec7549a200d-pi"><img alt="Listen and learn typewriter" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8357f3f2969e202a2eec7549a200d img-responsive" src="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e202a2eec7549e200d-pi" style="width: 297px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Listen and learn typewriter" /></a><br />Note: Grab a coffee, this post has donuts!

Today, thousands of posts and hundreds of thousands of comments and a million tears later, we&#39;re still helping sound the alarm that vaccination choice is a civil, medical and moral right. Once the Covid vaccines are approved for babies and toddlers, they are likely to end up on the pediatric schedule with protection from liability and little chance for the average parent to decline. Imagine yearly boosters, and playing Russian Roulette with myocarditis. If it&#39;s required for day care, school, camps, well, parents will comply to make childhood a little smoother. Smoother. We know better. We&#39;ve learned the hard way. Children&#39;s Health Defense has a tightly organized call to action asking all of us to tell the FDA - NO.&#0160; Below is an excerpt and link.&#0160; Please click over to see how you can spread the word to your loved ones, friends, colleagues and and&#0160; social media followers who might unfriend and unfollow you.

Consequently, their right to carry children was stolen. Wakefield chronicles this tragic story and brings shocking new evidence to light. As Dr. Stephen Karanja warns in the film, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen they\xe2\x80\x99re through with Africa, they\xe2\x80\x99re coming for you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\r\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe truths exposed in this film cast a long shadow from a tetanus trial in Africa to the symptoms of infertility that are happening all over the world, including reports after the <a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/gardasil-vaccine-linked-birth-rate-declines/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gardasil vaccine</a> and the <a href="https://infertilitymovie.org/wp-content/uploads/COVID-19-and-the-surge-in-Decidual-Cast-Shedding.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">COVID shots</a>,\xe2\x80\x9d said CHD chief science director Dr. Brian Hooker.</p>\r\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis film documents evidence that strongly supports the idea that the WHO was conducting an experiment on women of childbearing age to make them infertile without informed consent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Holland, CHD president, general counsel and author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HPV-Vaccine-Trial-Generation-Betrayed/dp/1510710809" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The HPV Vaccine On Trial: Seeking Justice For A Generation Betrayed</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t    <p class="entry-more-link font-entrybody"><a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/dr-andy-wakefield-and-childrens-health-defense-films-announce-the-premiere-of-infertility-a-diabolic.html#more">Continue reading "Dr. Andy Wakefield and Children\xe2\x80\x99s Health Defense Films Announce the Premiere of \xe2\x80\x98Infertility: A Diabolical Agenda\xe2\x80\x99" &raquo;</a></p>\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<div class="entry-footer">\n          <p class="entry-footer-info font-entryfooter"><span class="post-footers">Posted by <a rel="author" href="https://profile.typepad.com/rescuepost">Age of Autism</a> on June 10, 2022 at 06:00 AM in <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/current_affairs/">Current Affairs</a> </span> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="permalink" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/dr-andy-wakefield-and-childrens-health-defense-films-announce-the-premiere-of-infertility-a-diabolic.html">Permalink</a>\n\n \n\t<span class="separator"> | </span>\n\t\n\t\t\t <a class="entry-comments" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/dr-andy-wakefield-and-childrens-health-defense-films-announce-the-premiere-of-infertility-a-diabolic.html#comments">Comments (8)</a>\n\t\n\n\n          </p>\n\n\n          <!-- technorati tags -->\n\n\n\n          <!-- post footer links -->\n\t<p class="entry-footer-share entry-footer-share-buttons">\n\t\t<span class="entry-footer-links-twitter">\n     <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F06%2Fdr-andy-wakefield-and-childrens-health-defense-films-announce-the-premiere-of-infertility-a-diabolic.html&text=" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-twitter"></i></a>\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-plusone"></span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-pinterest">\n     <a href="javascript:void((function()%7Bvar%20e=document.createElement(\'script\');e.setAttribute(\'type\',\'text/javascript\');e.setAttribute(\'charset\',\'UTF-8\');e.setAttribute(\'src\',\'https://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=\'+Math.random()*99999999);document.body.appendChild(e)%7D)());"><i class="icon fab fa-pinterest"></i></a>\n\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-facebook_like">\n     \n     <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F06%2Fdr-andy-wakefield-and-childrens-health-defense-films-announce-the-premiere-of-infertility-a-diabolic.html" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-facebook"></i></a>\n     \n</span>\n\t</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n</article>\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n<!-- entry shared -->\n\n<article class="post entry">\n\n\n\n<!-- DISPLAY FULL POSTS-->\n\n     \n\n       <h2 class="entry-header font-entryheader">\n           \n        <span class="entry-title">\n<a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/part-3-frau-komas-second-coming-mass-murder-autism-and-the-cult-of-weaponized-genetics-.html">Part 3 Frau Koma\xe2\x80\x99s Second Coming:  Mass Murder, Autism and the Cult of Weaponized Genetics </a>\n        </span>\n       </h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<div class="entry-body font-entrybody">\n\t\t\t\t<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e2017c35eca4e5970b-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Frau K By Adriana Gamondes" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8357f3f2969e2017c35eca4e5970b img-responsive" src="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e2017c35eca4e5970b-400wi" style="width: 400px;

Marking a condition as a public safety hazard and those with the traits as near devils is the time honored manner of manufacturing public consent for exploitative and coercive treatment and dehumanization. In other words, a wide belief that those with autism are likely to kill could effectively snuff protest against drugging mandates which Torry, Satel, Koplewicz, NAMI, the American Psychiatric Association, the National Institute of Mental Health, a steady procession of presidential administrations and the pharmaceutical industry have pushed for all along.</p>\r\n<p>But the population with autism may be only one of many targets of this particular campaign. Autism research provides an endless supply of <a href="http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1107328" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unsubstantiated genetic corollaries</a> which have the distinction of being protected by the state in order to obfuscate the role of government public health agencies in contributing to an epidemic. And, of course, these unsubstantiated genetic corollaries have endless applications for political and industrial exploits.</p>\r\n<p>Questioning the \xe2\x80\x9clargely genetic\xe2\x80\x9d foundations of autism has ruined medical, scientific and media careers, and this may partly be because, as with the elusive schizophrenia \xe2\x80\x9cgenes,\xe2\x80\x9d so many reputations and articles of scientific faith hinge on the theory. For instance, if a group of researchers needs to prove that pigs fly to serve an industrial sponsor or as part of an exercise in &quot;weaponized anthropology\xe2\x80\x9d targeting a strategic or ideological foe, all they need do is link \xe2\x80\x9cproofs\xe2\x80\x9d of the imaginary flight of pigs to autism to create an automatic credibility shield</p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t    <p class="entry-more-link font-entrybody"><a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/part-3-frau-komas-second-coming-mass-murder-autism-and-the-cult-of-weaponized-genetics-.html#more">Continue reading "Part 3 Frau Koma\xe2\x80\x99s Second Coming:  Mass Murder, Autism and the Cult of Weaponized Genetics " &raquo;</a></p>\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<div class="entry-footer">\n          <p class="entry-footer-info font-entryfooter"><span class="post-footers">Posted by <a rel="author" href="https://profile.typepad.com/rescuepost">Age of Autism</a> on June 09, 2022 at 06:00 AM in <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/adriana-gamondes/">Adriana Gamondes</a> </span> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="permalink" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/part-3-frau-komas-second-coming-mass-murder-autism-and-the-cult-of-weaponized-genetics-.html">Permalink</a>\n\n \n\t<span class="separator"> | </span>\n\t\n\t\t\t <a class="entry-comments" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/part-3-frau-komas-second-coming-mass-murder-autism-and-the-cult-of-weaponized-genetics-.html#comments">Comments (2)</a>\n\t\n\n\n          </p>\n\n\n          <!-- technorati tags -->\n\n\n\n          <!-- post footer links -->\n\t<p class="entry-footer-share entry-footer-share-buttons">\n\t\t<span class="entry-footer-links-twitter">\n     <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F06%2Fpart-3-frau-komas-second-coming-mass-murder-autism-and-the-cult-of-weaponized-genetics-.html&text=Part%203%20F..." target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-twitter"></i></a>\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-plusone"></span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-pinterest">\n     <a href="javascript:void((function()%7Bvar%20e=document.createElement(\'script\');e.setAttribute(\'type\',\'text/javascript\');e.setAttribute(\'charset\',\'UTF-8\');e.setAttribute(\'src\',\'https://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=\'+Math.random()*99999999);document.body.appendChild(e)%7D)());"><i class="icon fab fa-pinterest"></i></a>\n\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-facebook_like">\n     \n     <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F06%2Fpart-3-frau-komas-second-coming-mass-murder-autism-and-the-cult-of-weaponized-genetics-.html" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-facebook"></i></a>\n     \n</span>\n\t</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n</article>\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n<!-- entry shared -->\n\n<article class="post entry">\n\n\n\n<!-- DISPLAY FULL POSTS-->\n\n     \n\n       <h2 class="entry-header font-entryheader">\n           \n        <span class="entry-title">\n<a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/twitter-disagreement-autism-is-a-disability-not-just-a-difference.html">Twitter Disagreement Autism Is a Disability Not Just a Difference</a>\n        </span>\n       </h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<div class="entry-body font-entrybody">\n\t\t\t\t<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e202a2eec6a4a5200d-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Twitter Report" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8357f3f2969e202a2eec6a4a5200d img-responsive" src="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e202a2eec6a4a5200d-300wi" style="width: 300px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Twitter Report" /></a>Disability or difference?&#0160; Let&#39;s get down to brass tacks. In the Age of Autism community, autism is a disability. It&#39;s not just a difference in my three daughters. They live under plenary guardianship. They rely on me for 100% of their health and safety and day to day life. They rely on the government for their $834 monthly Social insecurity, which I, like every parent here, supplement so that they have a roof over their heads. <br /><br />When I read the <a href="https://twitter.com/ageofautism" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tweet</a> in the photo on Monday, I&#39;d about had it&#0160; ACCEPTANCE as a vanilla flag waving moment.&#0160; April came and went, a quiet month and&#0160; it was changed from AWARENESS to ACCEPTANCE.&#0160; We still believe in ACTION, never acquiescence. I reported the account for hate speech.&#0160; Below are some of the comments we had <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AgeofAutism/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on our Facebook page</a> in response to the photo. We also need to be SEEN, HEARD and have PRIDE in what we do for our children, and for what our children endure.<br /><br />Symmetry Neuro-PT is a neurofeedback practice. One can only imagine how much much money they charge families to work with their child&#39;s different ability to make it a better kind of different ability. Almost as if it&#39;s a disability.<br /><br /><a href="https://twitter.com/ageofautism" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Follow us on Twitter</a><br /><br />COMMENTS FROM <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AgeofAutism/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FACEBOOK</a></p>\r\n<p>I just showed this to my daughter, 35 years old, autistic who said, it\xe2\x80\x99s a disability all right. Which is why she\xe2\x80\x99s still at home and will never work. If that\xe2\x80\x99s not a disability I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what is.</p>\r\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s just a different ability, that\xe2\x80\x99s why my 28yo daughter needs 24/7 care.

A cat&#39;s cradle is nothing but a bunch of X&#39;s between somebody&#39;s hands, and little kids look and look and look at all those X&#39;s...&quot;<br />&quot;And?&quot;</em><br /><em>&quot;No damn cat, and no damn cradle.&quot; ~</em>Kurt Vonnegut<em>, Cat\xe2\x80\x99s Cradle</em></p>\r\n<p>By Adriana Gamondes</p>\r\n<p>In the introduction to <em>Nuclear Rites</em>, Stanford anthropologist Hugh Gusterson explains why he approached a formal study of atomic weapons scientists in the same manner he\xe2\x80\x99d approach a tribal culture: \xe2\x80\x9cone powerful Western institution that is particularly understudied by anthropologists is science.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\r\n<p>Gusterson concludes that, though typical psychological analyses of weapons production bear some truth\xe2\x80\x94that the power of nuclear weapons systems become an extension of the self, an expression of potency,etc.\xe2\x80\x94the view too easily dismisses scientists\xe2\x80\x99 own rationalizations and ideology as mere distractions from driving psychosexual motives. Instead, according to Gusterson, scientists\xe2\x80\x99 faith in the ultimate morality of their work and the fact that this stems from the problems they\xe2\x80\x99re charged with solving (namely the belief that winning the arms race would prevent nuclear strikes by less evolved nations) might better explain the field\xe2\x80\x99s&#0160; euphemization of risks,&#0160; romanticization of their technology and exaggerated self-assurance that this technology can be controlled even in the face of repeated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_nuclear_accidents" rel="noopener" target="_blank">human error and equipment malfunction</a> &#0160;potentially costing the lives of millions. Gusterson discusses profit mostly as it pertains to scientific status, coveted name-rights and the ritual of \xe2\x80\x9cinitiation and transcendence\xe2\x80\x9d involved in creation and testing.</p>\r\n<p>The word \xe2\x80\x9cprofit\xe2\x80\x9d is derived from the Latin profectus\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto gain, advance or progress.\xe2\x80\x9c There are a variety of interweaving gains to be made in ventures that are perceived to advance humanity in the name of progress\xe2\x80\x94money is only one of them. Gusterson quotes <em>Robert Budwine, h</em>ead of the USA Delegation and director of Lawrence Livermore Laboratory:</p>\r\n<p><em>The United States, for all our manifest faults, is without a doubt the best hope for a future world of peace and prosperity\xe2\x80\xa6 Weapons research simply must continue at a determined and intensive level for our nation to have the opportunity to lead humankind towards some future utopian world order.</em></p>\r\n<p>Several of Gusterson\xe2\x80\x99s works begin with a quote from E.L. Doctorow: \xe2\x80\x9cThe bomb first was our weapon. Then it became our diplomacy. Next it became our economy. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s become our culture. We\xe2\x80\x99ve become the people of the bomb.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\r\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cTo the victor go the spoils\xe2\x80\x9d has a different meaning in that sense. Gusterson also points out in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Insecure-American-Here-Should-About/dp/0520259718" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Insecure American</em></a> that by becoming terrifying on the path to progress\xe2\x80\x94even if this is rationalized, as it always has been, as the conscious pursuit of the \xe2\x80\x9cgreater good\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ve terrified ourselves. Fear sells, but we\xe2\x80\x99re the chief consumers of it.</p>\r\n<p>Every social policy which requires the cover of morality and pursuit of a shining future to rationalize human and ecological collateral is now framed as a \xe2\x80\x9cwar\xe2\x80\x9d on some frightening specter or other: the war on terror, the war on disease, the war on street drugs, and the war on mental illness (providing the sanctioned replacement for street drugs).&#0160; Some are beginning to recognize that whenever the \xe2\x80\x9cwar on\xe2\x80\x9d prefix is attached to any problem, whatever the \xe2\x80\x9cwar\xe2\x80\x9d has been declared on will expand.</p>\r\n<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e2017d3fe2518d970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="AG War on Ed" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8357f3f2969e2017d3fe2518d970c" src="http://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e2017d3fe2518d970c-400wi" style="width: 400px;" title="AG War on Ed" /></a><br /><br /></p>\r\n<p>The voting public might backlash against some of these proverbial wars (case in point, the legalization of recreational marijuana in two states), but public opinion is increasingly feeble when it comes up against corporate interests. Most American voters wanted withdrawal from Afghanistan and for Wall Street bankers to be held accountable. Many were repelled by the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to gut limits on corporate campaign financing and <a href="http://www2.med.umich.edu/prmc/media/newsroom/details.cfm?ID=1760" rel="noopener" target="_blank">almost 90% of Americans are concerned about vaccine and prescription drug safety</a>.

Thanks.<br /><br />By Cathy Jameson<br /><br />One of the contacts we have with one of Ronan\xe2\x80\x99s program called last week.&#0160; She needed to go over some paperwork that gets reviewed and refiled yearly.&#0160; I don\xe2\x80\x99t usually dread the conversation I have with her like I do when some other people call.&#0160; For the most part, it\xe2\x80\x99s simple stuff that she asks about.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>\r\n<p><em>How\xe2\x80\x99s he doing?&#0160; </em></p>\r\n<p><em>Any changes in his health or development?</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Any hospitalizations or E.R. admits in the last 3 months?</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Any problems with medications?</em></p>\r\n<p>After she asks those questions, we then review goals.&#0160; I <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2018/03/coordinated-care.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was stunned the first time</a> she\xe2\x80\x99d asked me to make a year-long goal when we enrolled in the program.&#0160; Goals had always been something we created with therapists and educators, never with medical personnel.&#0160; I\xe2\x80\x99d forgotten about this portion of the call and was again taken aback when she asked which new goals I wanted to make.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cGoals?&#0160; Hmmm, I can think of a few, but remind me what I said last time,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.</p>\r\n<p><em>To become more actively engaged in community outings</em></p>\r\n<p>I laughed.&#0160; I laughed so hard.&#0160; Then I said, \xe2\x80\x98The covid lockdown, and then the shuttering of places we\xe2\x80\x99d normally go, shot down any chance of creating meaningful outings.&#0160; By the time places were open again, Ronan was so out of his normal routine.&#0160; He didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go anywhere or do any of the usual things he used to do.&#0160; He still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t some days.&#0160; We try to get him interested in things, including stuff his siblings are doing like we\xe2\x80\x99ve always done, but it\xe2\x80\x99s been a struggle.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\r\n<p>The nurse completely understood.</p>\r\n\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t    <p class="entry-more-link font-entrybody"><a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/setting-goals.html#more">Continue reading "Setting Goals" &raquo;</a></p>\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<div class="entry-footer">\n          <p class="entry-footer-info font-entryfooter"><span class="post-footers">Posted by <a rel="author" href="https://profile.typepad.com/rescuepost">Age of Autism</a> on June 05, 2022 at 06:00 AM in <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/cathy-jameson/">Cathy Jameson</a> </span> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="permalink" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/setting-goals.html">Permalink</a>\n\n \n\t<span class="separator"> | </span>\n\t\n\t\t\t <a class="entry-comments" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/setting-goals.html#comments">Comments (2)</a>\n\t\n\n\n          </p>\n\n\n          <!-- technorati tags -->\n\n\n\n          <!-- post footer links -->\n\t<p class="entry-footer-share entry-footer-share-buttons">\n\t\t<span class="entry-footer-links-twitter">\n     <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F06%2Fsetting-goals.html&text=Setting%20Goals" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-twitter"></i></a>\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-plusone"></span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-pinterest">\n     <a href="javascript:void((function()%7Bvar%20e=document.createElement(\'script\');e.setAttribute(\'type\',\'text/javascript\');e.setAttribute(\'charset\',\'UTF-8\');e.setAttribute(\'src\',\'https://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=\'+Math.random()*99999999);document.body.appendChild(e)%7D)());"><i class="icon fab fa-pinterest"></i></a>\n\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-facebook_like">\n     \n     <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F06%2Fsetting-goals.html" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-facebook"></i></a>\n     \n</span>\n\t</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n</article>\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n<!-- entry shared -->\n\n<article class="post entry">\n\n\n\n<!-- DISPLAY FULL POSTS-->\n\n     \n\n       <h2 class="entry-header font-entryheader">\n           \n        <span class="entry-title">\n<a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/florida-special-olympics-drops-covid-vaccine-mandate-for-athletes.html">Florida Special Olympics Drops Covid Vaccine Mandate for Athletes</a>\n        </span>\n       </h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<div class="entry-body font-entrybody">\n\t\t\t\t<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e202942fae2c4f200c-pi"><img alt="Inclusion" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8357f3f2969e202942fae2c4f200c img-responsive" src="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e202942fae2c4f200c-300wi" style="width: 281px;

He was very open about what autism is doing to our children. He\xe2\x80\x99s been watching the increases for more than 20 years, and he\xe2\x80\x99s the first to tell us that they are real. More children actually have autism and something in the environment is causing it. He also makes it clear that the future is very dark because the numbers show no signs of slowing down.</p>\r\n<p>I transcribed the entire interview, highlighting in bold the most noteworthy statements.</p>\r\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to dismiss the statistics and facts that Zahorodny cites here, yet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been doing just that for the last several decades. In fact, he describes the underhanded methods in play by the CDC to underestimate just how bad the increases are with the DSM-5 and what Zahorodny refers to as ADDM TWO.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>The most recent CDC report, the one that reports on study year 2018, is very interesting in that for the first time, they\xe2\x80\x99re not really concerned with autism prevalence. They\xe2\x80\x99re not really reporting. If you read carefully, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find out that they changed the methodology, and they\xe2\x80\x99re not really concern with what is the true prevalence of autism.</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>One thing that maybe nobody understands, maybe through your podcast people will begin to appreciate the fact that the CDC no longer\xe2\x80\x94and the ADDM Network\xe2\x80\x94no longer does active population surveillance. </em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>We\xe2\x80\x99re not trying to find all the cases of autism. That\xe2\x80\x99s the old system. I would call the old system ADDM ONE. You\xe2\x80\x99re trying to find all the true cases. </em></strong></p>\r\n<p>Zahorodny cites statistics that should cause panic in officials who get billions of dollars a year to oversee our health. Not only do the people at the CDC refuse to acknowledge that more children have autism, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve successfully covered up the real rate of autism.</p>\r\n\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t    <p class="entry-more-link font-entrybody"><a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/autism-prevalence-since-2000-wayne-rohde-interviews-dr-walter-zahorodny.html#more">Continue reading "Autism Prevalence Since 2000: Wayne Rohde Interviews Dr. Walter Zahorodny" &raquo;</a></p>\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<div class="entry-footer">\n          <p class="entry-footer-info font-entryfooter"><span class="post-footers">Posted by <a rel="author" href="https://profile.typepad.com/rescuepost">Age of Autism</a> on June 03, 2022 at 06:00 AM in <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/media/">Anne Dachel</a> </span> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="permalink" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/autism-prevalence-since-2000-wayne-rohde-interviews-dr-walter-zahorodny.html">Permalink</a>\n\n \n\t<span class="separator"> | </span>\n\t\n\t\t\t <a class="entry-comments" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/autism-prevalence-since-2000-wayne-rohde-interviews-dr-walter-zahorodny.html#comments">Comments (8)</a>\n\t\n\n\n          </p>\n\n\n          <!-- technorati tags -->\n\n\n\n          <!-- post footer links -->\n\t<p class="entry-footer-share entry-footer-share-buttons">\n\t\t<span class="entry-footer-links-twitter">\n     <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F06%2Fautism-prevalence-since-2000-wayne-rohde-interviews-dr-walter-zahorodny.html&text=Autism%20Prevalence%20Since%20..." target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-twitter"></i></a>\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-plusone"></span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-pinterest">\n     <a href="javascript:void((function()%7Bvar%20e=document.createElement(\'script\');e.setAttribute(\'type\',\'text/javascript\');e.setAttribute(\'charset\',\'UTF-8\');e.setAttribute(\'src\',\'https://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=\'+Math.random()*99999999);document.body.appendChild(e)%7D)());"><i class="icon fab fa-pinterest"></i></a>\n\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-facebook_like">\n     \n     <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F06%2Fautism-prevalence-since-2000-wayne-rohde-interviews-dr-walter-zahorodny.html" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-facebook"></i></a>\n     \n</span>\n\t</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n</article>\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n<!-- entry shared -->\n\n<article class="post entry">\n\n\n\n<!-- DISPLAY FULL POSTS-->\n\n     \n\n       <h2 class="entry-header font-entryheader">\n           \n        <span class="entry-title">\n<a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/best-of-frau-koma-returns-after-yet-another-mass-shooting.html">Best Of: Frau Koma Returns After Yet Another Mass Shooting</a>\n        </span>\n       </h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<div class="entry-body font-entrybody">\n\t\t\t\t<p><strong> <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e2017ee733082c970d-pi"><img alt="Frau K By Adriana Gamondes" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8357f3f2969e2017ee733082c970d img-responsive" src="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e2017ee733082c970d-400wi" style="width: 400px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Frau K By Adriana Gamondes" /></a><br /><br /></strong>Note: Yes.

Family members of the fifteen year old victim were outraged by the ruling, though Heinrichs stated that the accused\xe2\x80\x99s<strong> \xe2\x80\x9c</strong>basic normalcy now further confirms he no longer poses a risk of violence to anyone and that his mental deterioration and resulting violence would not have taken place without exposure to Prozac\xe2\x80\xa6He has none of the characteristics of a perpetrator of violence.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\r\n<p>Dr. Peter Breggin, the reform psychiatrist and psychopharmaceutical expert who testified on antidepressant-induced psychosis and violence in the Manitoba case, was sued for his medical license in 1987\xe2\x80\x94the very year that Prozac was first mass marketed by Eli Lilly. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/22/science/free-expression-or-irresponsibility-psychiatrist-faces-a-hearing-today.html?sec=health" rel="noopener" target="_blank">charges</a> were filed by the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), a consumer group which has always lobbied for forced institutionalization and mandated treatment of the mentally ill ( <a href="http://www.nami.org/Template.cfm?section=NAMI_Policy_Platform&amp;Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=38245" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Section 9.2</a> of NAMI\xe2\x80\x99s Public Policy Platform)\xe2\x80\x94including drugs and electroconvulsive therapy or <a href="http://www.nami.org/Template.cfm?Section=About_Treatments_and_Supports&amp;Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=142939" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ECT</a>\xe2\x80\x94 and was recently exposed as a long-standing pharmaceutical industry front organization in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/22/health/22nami.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p>Due to his success in banning forced lobotomy in institutions coupled with efforts to raise the alarm on clinical risks of ECT and psychiatric drugs, Dr. Breggin has been a thorn in the side of industry and its various front organizations since the 1970\xe2\x80\x99s. After Breggin went on <em>Oprah</em> and reported that Eli Lilly\xe2\x80\x99s own trial data showed that even individuals lacking histories of violence or serious mental illness who were exposed to the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant Prozac and antipsychotics would frequently develop violent ideation or violent psychosis, NAMI claimed that Breggin\xe2\x80\x99s remarks could cause patients to discontinue their meds. Following an outpouring of support for Breggin from the international medical reform community, the Maryland licensure board dropped the charges and Breggin prevailed. Seventeen years later, the FDA adopted black box warnings for suicide and violence on SSRI antidepressants. The black box warnings are, almost word for word, the precise clinical caveats that Breggin repeatedly submitted to the FDA and in Congressional hearings.</p>\r\n<p>The previously concealed Prozac trial data Breggin uncovered and exposed in 1987 included cases of child subjects on Prozac who suddenly developed intrusive dreams and visions of going to school with guns and shooting classmates.&#0160; There were also far more attempted and completed suicides among drug-exposed subjects than in the placebo groups.</p>\r\n<p>Over the years, Breggin and other researchers have worked to identify the mechanism by which certain psychopharmaceutical drugs induce violence and suicidality. Breggin has described phenomenon such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2574607" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drug-induced akathisia</a>, an uncontrollable sense of restless inner torment caused by an amphetamine-like and even LSD-like effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRI\xe2\x80\x99s, and has written about prescription drug-induced<strong> \xe2\x80\x9c</strong><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-peter-breggin/medication-madness-how-ps_b_223922.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">intoxication anosognosia</a>\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmedication spellbinding<strong>: </strong></p>\r\n<p><em>Medication spellbinding has four basic effects. </em></p>\r\n\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t    <p class="entry-more-link font-entrybody"><a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/best-of-frau-koma-returns-after-yet-another-mass-shooting.html#more">Continue reading "Best Of: Frau Koma Returns After Yet Another Mass Shooting" &raquo;</a></p>\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<div class="entry-footer">\n          <p class="entry-footer-info font-entryfooter"><span class="post-footers">Posted by <a rel="author" href="https://profile.typepad.com/rescuepost">Age of Autism</a> on June 02, 2022 at 06:00 AM in <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/adriana-gamondes/">Adriana Gamondes</a> </span> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="permalink" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/best-of-frau-koma-returns-after-yet-another-mass-shooting.html">Permalink</a>\n\n \n\t<span class="separator"> | </span>\n\t\n\t\t\t <a class="entry-comments" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/best-of-frau-koma-returns-after-yet-another-mass-shooting.html#comments">Comments (2)</a>\n\t\n\n\n          </p>\n\n\n          <!-- technorati tags -->\n\n\n\n          <!-- post footer links -->\n\t<p class="entry-footer-share entry-footer-share-buttons">\n\t\t<span class="entry-footer-links-twitter">\n     <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F06%2Fbest-of-frau-koma-returns-after-yet-another-mass-shooting.html&text=Best%20Of%3A%20Frau%20Koma%20Returns%20After%20Yet%20A..." target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-twitter"></i></a>\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-plusone"></span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-pinterest">\n     <a href="javascript:void((function()%7Bvar%20e=document.createElement(\'script\');e.setAttribute(\'type\',\'text/javascript\');e.setAttribute(\'charset\',\'UTF-8\');e.setAttribute(\'src\',\'https://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=\'+Math.random()*99999999);document.body.appendChild(e)%7D)());"><i class="icon fab fa-pinterest"></i></a>\n\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-facebook_like">\n     \n     <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F06%2Fbest-of-frau-koma-returns-after-yet-another-mass-shooting.html" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-facebook"></i></a>\n     \n</span>\n\t</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n</article>\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n<!-- entry shared -->\n\n<article class="post entry">\n\n\n\n<!-- DISPLAY FULL POSTS-->\n\n     \n\n       <h2 class="entry-header font-entryheader">\n           \n        <span class="entry-title">\n<a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/06/summer-breakation-and-autism.html">Summer Breakation and Autism</a>\n        </span>\n       </h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<div class="entry-body font-entrybody">\n\t\t\t\t<div class="photo-wrap photo-xid-6a00d8357f3f2969e202942fada23c200c" id="photo-xid-6a00d8357f3f2969e202942fada23c200c" style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; width: 250px;"><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e202942fada23c200c-pi"><img alt="Retro school&#39;s out" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8357f3f2969e202942fada23c200c img-responsive" src="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e202942fada23c200c-250wi" style="width: 250px;" title="Retro school&#39;s out" /></a>\r\n<div class="photo-caption caption-xid-6a00d8357f3f2969e202942fada23c200c" id="caption-xid-6a00d8357f3f2969e202942fada23c200c">In September, for my youngest.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Extended School Year, or ESY, is a hot topic in special education. Programs vary dramatically from state to state and school district to school district.&#0160; Our town district ESY changed over the years, from 5 days a week, for 6 weeks to 4 days a week for a month, with a shortened day. My youngest is about to begin her final round of ESY at her private placement in July.&#0160; Hers is a 5 day program, and runs 4 weeks. There&#39;s a good 6 weeks of downtime. It&#39;s discouraging. Worse? She ages out of school altogether in September. As of now, there is no program that will accept her, because she has a gigantic budget that includes a 1:1. I say that tongue in cheek. Her state administered budget will sit, unused, unless a program that I deem acceptable will accept her.

Yesterday&#39;s memory was from 11 &#0160;years ago, when Mark Blaxill and Dan Olmsted shared advance copies of their book titled, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Age-Autism-Medicine-Man-Made-Epidemic/dp/0312547099/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Age of Autism Mercury Medicine and a Manmade Epidemic </a>at Autism One.

(I hope that isn&#39;t springing the news on you.) This blog was launched by Dan and Mark in preparation for their book. Dan&#39;s life work became autism. After a stellar journalism career, he devoted himself to the epidemic. To a degree, we all abandonned our initial careers when autism broke into our homes. We were drafted. Dan enlisted. He provided a steady, guiding hand, and together he and Mark produced Pulitzer quality work that was often largely ignored or suppressed. Blogs ruled the landscape, and we had intense rivalries, that, looking back, seem quaint. HeraldBlog, Orac, Kristina Chew, Kevin Leitch, Amanda Baggs - how they dined on us in their never ending effort to make sure no one believed in the autism epidemic. <br /><br />Last week, the United States was pummeled by another school shooting. 19 schoolkids, 2 teachers, 1 husband who could not bear the grief. Another epidemic that seems to have no resolution even when its carnage can not be denied. It&#39;s tough to gaslight families when there are corpses. A Facebook commenter made a reference to something Dr. Bernard Rimland may have said or written, about a generation of angry boys growing up.&#0160; If you have the reference, let me know.

That expression rings through once more\xe2\x80\xa6and makes for some interesting (and maybe even entertaining) storytelling here.&#0160; </em></p>\r\n<p>Two weeks ago, a hornet crawled out of a floor vent in our den.&#0160; Ronan\xe2\x80\x99s caregiver was home with Ronan when the scary, flying beast emerged.&#0160; She trapped it, God bless her, and was rightly traumatized afterwards from the frightening few minutes the hornet was in my home.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>Later, while telling my husband about the incident, he said it might be time to call an exterminator.&#0160; We\xe2\x80\x99d seen wasps in the house when the weather had started to warm up.&#0160; A friend in the area had shared that they, too, get wasps in the house \xe2\x80\x93 sometimes from their chimney, sometimes through an air vent.&#0160; Like the friend does, I trap and kill them.&#0160; I used to be a catch-and-release kinda gal.&#0160; Not so much anymore.&#0160; I like nature, but I never like to see that sort of nature in my house.&#0160; Unable to figure out how these insects were coming in, I knew we had to do something more.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>A few exterminator companies would be available to help me, but I know that their first-line of defense would sometimes be some sort of chemical concoction.&#0160; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want that option in case whatever they used would have negative interactions with Ronan\xe2\x80\x99s health.&#0160; After speaking to the company\xe2\x80\x99s representative, who completely understood my predicament (and who said she\xe2\x80\x99d be living in a hotel room if she ever experienced a hornet in the house), I agreed to have their technician come over for an inspection.&#0160; I\xe2\x80\x99d have to wait a few days though.&#0160; Their schedule and mine wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t match up until after the weekend.</p>\r\n<p>While I anxiously waited, Ronan\xe2\x80\x99s big sister helped put screens over every floor vent in the house.&#0160; It might be a temporary fix, we said, but it was one that made our adrenaline rush less.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>I got up early Monday morning to make breakfast for Ronan before woke up and to be ready for the inspection.&#0160; Hoping he\xe2\x80\x99d sleep in since he\xe2\x80\x99d had two very early morning wake ups two days in a row, Ronan decided that the very second the technician drove down our driveway would be the very best time to wake up.&#0160; He didn\xe2\x80\x99t come find me right away like he usually does after waking up, but waited a few minutes.&#0160; I was glad for that because it gave me a few minutes to give the young tech some information about the hornet that scared us.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>While the tech was telling me what he would do first, which would be a walkthrough of the house and a peek in the attic, I heard Ronan walking toward us.&#0160; So as not to startle the young man, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, hey, there\xe2\x80\x99s my son.\xe2\x80\x9d&#0160; The young man replied, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I heard you had a son that has some medical conditions and that you\xe2\x80\x99re concerned with some of the sprays used to treat bugs.\xe2\x80\x9d&#0160; As I gave him a quick rundown of my concerns, Ronan took himself to the bathroom.&#0160; Within a few seconds, I could hear that he was actually using the bathroom.</p>\r\n<p><em>Wow, </em>I thought<em>, great job, Rone!&#0160; All those mornings that we, or his caregiver, had guided him to the bathroom first thing in the morning is paying off.&#0160; </em></p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t    <p class="entry-more-link font-entrybody"><a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/05/always-something.html#more">Continue reading " Always Something" &raquo;</a></p>\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<div class="entry-footer">\n          <p class="entry-footer-info font-entryfooter"><span class="post-footers">Posted by <a rel="author" href="https://profile.typepad.com/rescuepost">Age of Autism</a> on May 29, 2022 at 06:00 AM in <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/cathy-jameson/">Cathy Jameson</a> </span> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="permalink" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/05/always-something.html">Permalink</a>\n\n \n\t<span class="separator"> | </span>\n\t\n\t\t\t <a class="entry-comments" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/05/always-something.html#comments">Comments (6)</a>\n\t\n\n\n          </p>\n\n\n          <!-- technorati tags -->\n\n\n\n          <!-- post footer links -->\n\t<p class="entry-footer-share entry-footer-share-buttons">\n\t\t<span class="entry-footer-links-twitter">\n     <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F05%2Falways-something.html&text=%20Always%20Something" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-twitter"></i></a>\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-plusone"></span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-pinterest">\n     <a href="javascript:void((function()%7Bvar%20e=document.createElement(\'script\');e.setAttribute(\'type\',\'text/javascript\');e.setAttribute(\'charset\',\'UTF-8\');e.setAttribute(\'src\',\'https://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=\'+Math.random()*99999999);document.body.appendChild(e)%7D)());"><i class="icon fab fa-pinterest"></i></a>\n\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-facebook_like">\n     \n     <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F05%2Falways-something.html" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-facebook"></i></a>\n     \n</span>\n\t</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n</article>\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n<!-- entry shared -->\n\n<article class="post entry">\n\n\n\n<!-- DISPLAY FULL POSTS-->\n\n     \n\n       <h2 class="entry-header font-entryheader">\n           \n        <span class="entry-title">\n<a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/05/safeminds-new-study-shows-1-in-100-children-are-diagnosed-with-asd-around-the-world.html">Safeminds: New Study Shows 1 in 100 Children Are Diagnosed with ASD Around the World</a>\n        </span>\n       </h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<div class="entry-body font-entrybody">\n\t\t\t\t<p><a href="https://safeminds.org/news/its-not-just-the-u-s-global-autism-rates-continue-to-climb/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> </a><strong><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e20278807f4d04200d-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Lather rinse repeat" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8357f3f2969e20278807f4d04200d img-responsive" src="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e20278807f4d04200d-200wi" style="width: 200px;

Awareness is a dirty word by now in the USA, but elsewhere in the world, there is a huge need to educate.

This figure comes from a new systematic review of 99 prevalence estimates from 34 countries.&#0160; A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aur.239">decade ago</a>, the global rate was 62 in 10,000. Similar to the U.S., the study found that boys worldwide are four times more likely than girls to have autism. Also included in the study was the median percentage of autism with co-occurring intellectual disability, which was reported at 33%. The studies analyzed for the review varied in size, ranging from 465 participants to 50 million. The prevalence estimates also varied greatly, ranging from 1.09 in 10,000 to 436 in 10,000. Most of the studies included in the review were conducted in the U.S. and Northern Europe. However, previously underrepresented regions like Africa and the Middle East were also included. The study\xe2\x80\x99s lead author, Andy Shih, suggests that these findings show efforts to improve autism awareness are succeeding and that many regions have improved in identifying, diagnosing, and treating individuals with autism. Shih also believes the rise in the new global autism rate is due to changes in the definition of autism and differences in the methodology and contexts of prevalence studies.</p>\r\n<p><a href="https://www.disabilityscoop.com/2022/05/19/autism-prevalence-rising-globally/29864/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Original Article</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aur.2696" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Original Study</a></p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<div class="entry-footer">\n          <p class="entry-footer-info font-entryfooter"><span class="post-footers">Posted by <a rel="author" href="https://profile.typepad.com/rescuepost">Age of Autism</a> on May 28, 2022 at 06:00 AM in <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/current_affairs/">Current Affairs</a> </span> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="permalink" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/05/safeminds-new-study-shows-1-in-100-children-are-diagnosed-with-asd-around-the-world.html">Permalink</a>\n\n \n\t<span class="separator"> | </span>\n\t\n\t\t\t <a class="entry-comments" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/05/safeminds-new-study-shows-1-in-100-children-are-diagnosed-with-asd-around-the-world.html#comments">Comments (8)</a>\n\t\n\n\n          </p>\n\n\n          <!-- technorati tags -->\n\n\n\n          <!-- post footer links -->\n\t<p class="entry-footer-share entry-footer-share-buttons">\n\t\t<span class="entry-footer-links-twitter">\n     <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F05%2Fsafeminds-new-study-shows-1-in-100-children-are-diagnosed-with-asd-around-the-world.html&text=Safeminds%3A%20N..." target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-twitter"></i></a>\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-plusone"></span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-pinterest">\n     <a href="javascript:void((function()%7Bvar%20e=document.createElement(\'script\');e.setAttribute(\'type\',\'text/javascript\');e.setAttribute(\'charset\',\'UTF-8\');e.setAttribute(\'src\',\'https://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=\'+Math.random()*99999999);document.body.appendChild(e)%7D)());"><i class="icon fab fa-pinterest"></i></a>\n\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-facebook_like">\n     \n     <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F05%2Fsafeminds-new-study-shows-1-in-100-children-are-diagnosed-with-asd-around-the-world.html" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-facebook"></i></a>\n     \n</span>\n\t</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n</article>\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n<!-- entry shared -->\n\n<article class="post entry">\n\n\n\n<!-- DISPLAY FULL POSTS-->\n\n     \n\n       <h2 class="entry-header font-entryheader">\n           \n        <span class="entry-title">\n<a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/05/180-x-6-x-13.html">180 x 6 x 13</a>\n        </span>\n       </h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<div class="entry-body font-entrybody">\n\t\t\t\t<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e202942facdad6200c-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Salvador ramos" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8357f3f2969e202942facdad6200c img-responsive" src="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e202942facdad6200c-250wi" style="width: 212px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Salvador ramos" /></a>180 school days x 6 hours a day x 13 years (K-12) = 14,040 hours in the care of professional teachers, therapists, social workers, school psychologists, administrators and surrounded by peers.<br /><br />WHAT. GOES. SO. WRONG?<br /><br />Here in Connecticut, we are still dealing with the aftermath of a stabbing at a high school party two weeks ago. One teen named <a href="https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-news-friends-family-community-mourn-james-mcgrath-20220521-22x4dojkvrayxexrxhgoujoipi-story.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jimmy McGrath</a> was killed, three injured, and the aggressor, a 16 year old student, is out on a $2,000,000 bond awaiting trial as an adult. <br /><br />I can&#39;t bring myself to call these young men monsters - though their actions are monstrous. They aren&#39;t serial killers like Jeffrey Dahmer, who can be profiled back to childhood with violent fascinations. I cringe when I hear in almost every case, &quot;He was a loner. He didn&#39;t talk to anyone. He had no friends. He dressed weird.&#0160; He kept to himself.&quot;&#0160; <br /><br />I suppose will we learn bits and pieces, while the media politicizes most of the tragedy. </p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<div class="entry-footer">\n          <p class="entry-footer-info font-entryfooter"><span class="post-footers">Posted by <a rel="author" href="https://profile.typepad.com/rescuepost">Age of Autism</a> on May 27, 2022 at 06:00 AM in <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/nightmares/">Nightmares</a> </span> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="permalink" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/05/180-x-6-x-13.html">Permalink</a>\n\n \n\t<span class="separator"> | </span>\n\t\n\t\t\t <a class="entry-comments" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/05/180-x-6-x-13.html#comments">Comments (12)</a>\n\t\n\n\n          </p>\n\n\n          <!-- technorati tags -->\n\n\n\n          <!-- post footer links -->\n\t<p class="entry-footer-share entry-footer-share-buttons">\n\t\t<span class="entry-footer-links-twitter">\n     <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F05%2F180-x-6-x-13.html&text=180%20x%206%20x%2013" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-twitter"></i></a>\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-plusone"></span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-pinterest">\n     <a href="javascript:void((function()%7Bvar%20e=document.createElement(\'script\');e.setAttribute(\'type\',\'text/javascript\');e.setAttribute(\'charset\',\'UTF-8\');e.setAttribute(\'src\',\'https://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=\'+Math.random()*99999999);document.body.appendChild(e)%7D)());"><i class="icon fab fa-pinterest"></i></a>\n\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-facebook_like">\n     \n     <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F05%2F180-x-6-x-13.html" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-facebook"></i></a>\n     \n</span>\n\t</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n</article>\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n<!-- entry shared -->\n\n<article class="post entry">\n\n\n\n<!-- DISPLAY FULL POSTS-->\n\n     \n\n       <h2 class="entry-header font-entryheader">\n           \n        <span class="entry-title">\n<a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/05/would-kids-with-autism-survive-a-shooter.html">Would Kids With Autism Survive A Shooter?</a>\n        </span>\n       </h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<div class="entry-body font-entrybody">\n\t\t\t\t<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e202942facc449200c-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Go Talk Quiet" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8357f3f2969e202942facc449200c img-responsive" src="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e202942facc449200c-250wi" style="width: 250px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Go Talk Quiet" /></a>The nation reels from another mass shooting at an elementary school. While listening to news reports throughout the day, I remembered something that happened to me several years ago. I was at the High School for one of my daughters&#39; IEP meetings. I was in the classroom with students and staff, including paras. Suddenly an alarm went off and an Active Shooter Drill was underway. I was closed in the classroom with everyone. None of the students with autism was completely quiet, including my daughter. One student was loud. Could have been any of my 3 daughters, none of whom can regulate their voice or stimming for more than a few seconds. One Paraprofessional asked, &quot;How would you keep him quiet,&quot; to the other. &quot;Oh, I&#39;d find a way to shut him up.&quot; I was appalled. But I know that if there were a situation like the massacre in Uvalde, Texas, or up the road from me in Newtown, Connecticut, some, many, most or perhaps all of the students with autism would be in grave danger because of their disability. This might be the ONLY time a quiet/seclusion room would be useful. I would like to think that most staff would try to shield the kids and keep them quiet. I&#39;m not sure I could keep my own kids quiet. And so I ask, if there is a shooter in a school, what happens to the special needs/autistic students, and is there a plan just for them that honors their needs?<br /><br /></p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<div class="entry-footer">\n          <p class="entry-footer-info font-entryfooter"><span class="post-footers">Posted by <a rel="author" href="https://profile.typepad.com/rescuepost">Age of Autism</a> on May 26, 2022 at 06:00 AM in <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/nightmares/">Nightmares</a> </span> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="permalink" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/05/would-kids-with-autism-survive-a-shooter.html">Permalink</a>\n\n \n\t<span class="separator"> | </span>\n\t\n\t\t\t <a class="entry-comments" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/05/would-kids-with-autism-survive-a-shooter.html#comments">Comments (6)</a>\n\t\n\n\n          </p>\n\n\n          <!-- technorati tags -->\n\n\n\n          <!-- post footer links -->\n\t<p class="entry-footer-share entry-footer-share-buttons">\n\t\t<span class="entry-footer-links-twitter">\n     <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F05%2Fwould-kids-with-autism-survive-a-shooter.html&text=Would%20Kids%20With%20Autism%20Survive%20A%20Shooter%3F" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-twitter"></i></a>\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-plusone"></span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-pinterest">\n     <a href="javascript:void((function()%7Bvar%20e=document.createElement(\'script\');e.setAttribute(\'type\',\'text/javascript\');e.setAttribute(\'charset\',\'UTF-8\');e.setAttribute(\'src\',\'https://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=\'+Math.random()*99999999);document.body.appendChild(e)%7D)());"><i class="icon fab fa-pinterest"></i></a>\n\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-facebook_like">\n     \n     <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F05%2Fwould-kids-with-autism-survive-a-shooter.html" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-facebook"></i></a>\n     \n</span>\n\t</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n</article>\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- entry shared -->\n\n<article class="post entry">\n\n\n\n<!-- DISPLAY FULL POSTS-->\n\n     \n\n       <h2 class="entry-header font-entryheader">\n           \n        <span class="entry-title">\n<a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/05/fractured-fairytales.html">Fractured Fairytales</a>\n        </span>\n       </h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<div class="entry-body font-entrybody">\n\t\t\t\t<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e20282e15765b0200b-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Fractured fairy tales" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8357f3f2969e20282e15765b0200b img-responsive" src="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e20282e15765b0200b-250wi" style="width: 250px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Fractured fairy tales" /></a>After I wrote this post, the news broke about 18 year old Salvador Ramos, who killed in cold blood 19 elementary school students and 2 adults in Uvalde, Texas. I am in no way equating the agony of having your child murdered in school with having a child with autism. I am going to point out that systems everywhere are broken beyond repair. And failing children right into adulthood. Those who make it. We have a generation that literally has the WORLD in their palm of their hand, and yet are so very alone. Angry. Vindictive. Without coping skills. We say it&#39;s a gun issue. We say it&#39;s a mental health issue. It seems like a radically altered childhood issue. And no one wants to talk about it. What the hell has happened to our kids?&#0160; <br /><br />###<br /><br />Those readers of a certain age will remember the Fractured Fairy Tales cartoons that aired during Bullwinkle. Today&#39;s post is about the fracturing within our community. Ignored. Disregarded. Glossed over. Not here.<br /><br />Many of our readers are drowning in ever deeper waters as their children head into adulthood. There are few supports once school lets out. Day programs are turning down autistic individuals with high levels of need.&#0160; Jobs are grim for those who qualify for viable employment with or without supports.&#0160; Medical freedom and Covid have eclipsed autism everywhere - even within organizations that were founded by warrior families. Biomedical treatment is a distant memory. Spelling has become the new darling.&#0160; New reports of beautiful Elizabeth Bonker, who was Valedictorian for her college class, they mention, &quot;She lost her speech at 15 months,&quot; but none asked WHY??? It&#39;s as if they said, &quot;She got glasses in 3rd grade.&quot; Perfectly normal. Spelling is wonderful, I&#39;ve seen my own daughters intelligence shine through. I am a big fan.&#0160; Then reality steps in. I just saw a spelling training program that sounds fantastic. 8 weeks of intensive training with support. $1000 per trainee. I need 4 or 5 trainees at least. I can&#39;t be the only &quot;voice&quot; for my 3 daughters. I need others to be able to train and learn, but at $1000 each? Even if I train them. Staff quits. What then? &#0160;I have been my daughters\xe2\x80\x99 &#0160;trainer for more than 25 years. And with spelling&#39;s success and marketing, there\xe2\x80\x99s yet another documentary, and an invitation to fly to the Midwest to view it. I&#0160; have a hard time getting to the Stop and Shop up the street. It&#39;s enough. If I sound like I&#39;m complaining, I am. I&#39;m angry that after 2+ decades of work, 15 years of Age of Autism, nothing much has changed for families. Young Moms who are able to get into a diagnosis center leave with exactly what most of us got years go. NOTHING. No road map. No plan. Just &quot;Call early intervention and find yourself 30 hours of ABA a week. Good luck, call us in a year.&quot; Students in school get speech and OT that are all but useless even after 18 years. Assistive Technology flopped, it&#39;s completely hit or miss who can use it, program it, buy an iPad every few months to replace the one thrown across the room and shattered. It&#39;s disheartening in the extreme. Yesterday, I saw a post that only hardened my heart. A dear friend of our community, a PhD with autism who was active at Autism One and other conferences, wrote <br /><br />&quot;<em><span class="d2edcug0 hpfvmrgz qv66sw1b c1et5uql lr9zc1uh a8c37x1j fe6kdd0r mau55g9w c8b282yb keod5gw0 nxhoafnm aigsh9s9 d3f4x2em iv3no6db jq4qci2q a3bd9o3v b1v8xokw oo9gr5id hzawbc8m" dir="auto">Reporting from London as XXX and I gear up to explore literature and research findings that support shifting to strength-based views of autistic people.

This time it\xe2\x80\x99s from Northern Ireland. An annual report released on May 20<sup>th</sup> revealed that, according to the Department of Health, <strong>one in every 17 students in the 6 counties of Northern Ireland is autistic.

Violently ableist.... Spend a day with one of our strapping adult males during an autistic episode and then talk to us about violence, Kristin.&#0160; The Ivory tower is actually made of cotton - and plugged into their deaf ears.<br /><br />###<br /><br />By Katie Wright:<br /><br />So many people hate the politically correct elitism of places like Harvard. But Harvard makes it so easy!!<br /><br />A few weeks ago, the Sadhguru Center, a TEACHING hospital associated with Harvard offered panel called, \xe2\x80\x9cAutism Awareness: Thinking Outside the Box.\xe2\x80\x9d It could not sound more innocuous.<br /><br />The panel described itself as a multidisciplinary discussion to explore autism beyond conventions. Sounds good to me. As a parent of a young man with severe autism, I have spent too much time educating doctors on the basics of autism. Apparently, they learn next to nothing about autism in medical school. Approximately 5% of American boys diagnosed with autism and almost half have chronic health problems.<br /><br />However, Harvard sophomore Kristin B. King went ballistic about the autism panel . This young woman claims to have autism. I know, I know......Lately, any smart, lonely, quirky, nonconformist labels themselves \xe2\x80\x9cautistic.\xe2\x80\x9d Almost none actually meet the DSM definition of autism. It is a disabling condition and makes communication and social interaction especially challenging. Not so for King! She rails against the conference, creates petitions to stop it, bullies Harvard administration.....I know, it\xe2\x80\x99s absurd.<br /><br />King declares, \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the panel\xe2\x80\x99s goals is to treat autism. That is not only violently ableist but scientifically incorrect!\xe2\x80\x9d Oh my God, King\xe2\x80\x99s histrionics make me wince with embarrassment for her. This is a bright young woman throwing a temper tantrum and demanding discussion she does not understand be cancelled.<br /><br />What\xe2\x80\x99s worse is that the teaching hospital caved to King\xe2\x80\x99s bullying nonsense and cancelled an educational autism event that dozens of doctors should have attended. What cowards! Then they basically apologized! \xe2\x80\x9cWe are pausing, deeply reflecting and learning before we consciously take next steps, \xe2\x80\x9c said a Sadhguru Center representative.<br /><br />Why capitulate to a historic 21 year old with, clearly, no real expertise with autism. My son cannot read, write, speak or care for himself in any way. He needs and continues to need treatment in the form of speech and occupational therapy. Like nearly half of ASD people, he also needs regular medical help for his epilepsy and IBD. This treatment is not \xe2\x80\x9cviolently ableist,\xe2\x80\x9d it is essential to his well-being.</p>\r\n\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t    <p class="entry-more-link font-entrybody"><a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/05/harvard-sophomore-kristin-king-rails-against-violently-ableist-sadhguru-autism-awareness-panel.html#more">Continue reading "Harvard Sophomore Kristin King Rails Against Violently Ableist Sadhguru Autism Awareness Panel" &raquo;</a></p>\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<div class="entry-footer">\n          <p class="entry-footer-info font-entryfooter"><span class="post-footers">Posted by <a rel="author" href="https://profile.typepad.com/rescuepost">Age of Autism</a> on May 23, 2022 at 06:00 AM in <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/katie-wright/">Katie Wright</a> </span> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="permalink" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/05/harvard-sophomore-kristin-king-rails-against-violently-ableist-sadhguru-autism-awareness-panel.html">Permalink</a>\n\n \n\t<span class="separator"> | </span>\n\t\n\t\t\t <a class="entry-comments" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/05/harvard-sophomore-kristin-king-rails-against-violently-ableist-sadhguru-autism-awareness-panel.html#comments">Comments (7)</a>\n\t\n\n\n          </p>\n\n\n          <!-- technorati tags -->\n\n\n\n          <!-- post footer links -->\n\t<p class="entry-footer-share entry-footer-share-buttons">\n\t\t<span class="entry-footer-links-twitter">\n     <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F05%2Fharvard-sophomore-kristin-king-rails-against-violently-ableist-sadhguru-autism-awareness-panel.html&text=H..." target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-twitter"></i></a>\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-plusone"></span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-pinterest">\n     <a href="javascript:void((function()%7Bvar%20e=document.createElement(\'script\');e.setAttribute(\'type\',\'text/javascript\');e.setAttribute(\'charset\',\'UTF-8\');e.setAttribute(\'src\',\'https://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=\'+Math.random()*99999999);document.body.appendChild(e)%7D)());"><i class="icon fab fa-pinterest"></i></a>\n\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-facebook_like">\n     \n     <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F05%2Fharvard-sophomore-kristin-king-rails-against-violently-ableist-sadhguru-autism-awareness-panel.html" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-facebook"></i></a>\n     \n</span>\n\t</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n</article>\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n<!-- entry shared -->\n\n<article class="post entry">\n\n\n\n<!-- DISPLAY FULL POSTS-->\n\n     \n\n       <h2 class="entry-header font-entryheader">\n           \n        <span class="entry-title">\n<a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/05/best-of-hey-autism-awareness-whered-ya-go.html">Best Of: Hey Autism Awareness, Where\'d Ya Go?</a>\n        </span>\n       </h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<div class="entry-body font-entrybody">\n\t\t\t\t<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e20263e9a0636f200b-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Broken blue light bulb" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8357f3f2969e20263e9a0636f200b img-responsive" src="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e20263e9a0636f200b-250wi" style="width: 250px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Broken blue light bulb" /></a>Note: Cathy has today off. Did you notice how few stories there were about autism last month?&#0160; Cathy did, last year. We&#39;ve dropped off the radar in the public eye, yesterday&#39;s darling. <br /><br />###<br /><br />By Cathy Jameson</p>\r\n<p>Around this time last year, <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2020/04/mid-month-blues.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I noticed that autism had all but dropped off the news cycle</a>.&#0160; It appears to have taken a back seat again this year.&#0160; No big fan of how the month of April has been blue-washed for well over a decade, I\xe2\x80\x99m okay with fewer autism awareness campaigns.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>Always a strong proponent for autism action, I\xe2\x80\x99m not even seeing that in this month\xe2\x80\x99s news stories.&#0160; <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2021/02/the-fading-flu-shot.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Like the flu</a>, and <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2020/10/hey-measles-whered-you-go.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">like the measles</a>, <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2020/10/hey-measles-whered-you-go.html"></a> COVID19 has replaced illnesses, diseases, and other health conditions the world over.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>Autism awareness may have disappeared from the media, but the autism epidemic still exists.&#0160; Some will argue that autism, a spectrum disorder, is not an epidemic.&#0160; While it\xe2\x80\x99s not a disease or illness, autism, a condition that can significantly impact physical and mental health, does fit the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s definition of epidemic. From <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/glossary.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their website: CDC.gov</a></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>epidemic</em></strong><em>&#0160;the occurrence of more cases of disease, injury, or other health condition than expected in a given area or among a specific group of persons during a particular period. Usually, the cases are presumed to have a common cause or to be related to one another in some way</em></p>\r\n<p>Last updated in 2020, the current rate, which has risen steadily for decades, is 1 in 54 reported cases.&#0160; Even though the numbers are not a true representation, if that trend continues more will be added at the next reporting period.&#0160; Based on data from years ago, and from only a handful children in only a handful of states, a more accurate rate is likely much higher.&#0160; With that, I\xe2\x80\x99d say that one can absolutely use the <a href="https://tacanow.org/autism-statistics/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">word epidemic to describe what\xe2\x80\x99s happening</a>!

While conducting their study, the authors analyzed parent reports of gastrointestinal issues and <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/internalizing-behaviors-and-depression-1066876">internalizing behaviors</a> of 621 minors with autism. The research team used <a href="https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pathana" rel="noopener" target="_blank">path models in a structural equation modeling framework</a> to further investigate their data. After examining the parental reports, the researchers believed the best-fitting model for this brain/gut phenomenon was a bidirectional model where internalizing behaviors (e.g., withdrawn and anxious behaviors) were associated with gastrointestinal issues (e.g., constipation, diarrhea, nausea and stomach pain). Sadly, this cycle then repeats, causing an endless loop of suffering for children experiencing both GI problems and internalizing behaviors. Co-author Brad Fergson expounds on his team\xe2\x80\x99s work, stating, \xe2\x80\x9cStress signals from the brain can alter the release of neurotransmitters like <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/serotonin-the-natural-mood-booster" rel="noopener" target="_blank">serotonin</a> and <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22610-norepinephrine-noradrenaline#:~:text=Norepinephrine%2C%20also%20called%20noradrenaline%2C%20is,muscle%20cell%20or%20gland%20cell." rel="noopener" target="_blank">norepinephrine</a> in the gut, which control <a href="https://health.ucsd.edu/specialties/gastro/areas-expertise/motility-physiology/pages/default.aspx#:~:text=Gastrointestinal%20(GI)%20motility%20refers%20to,body%20starts%20this%20complicated%20process." rel="noopener" target="_blank">gastrointestinal motility</a>, or the movement of stool through the intestines.\xe2\x80\x9d He adds, \xe2\x80\x9cStress also impacts the balance of bacteria living in the gut, called the microbiota, which can alter gastrointestinal functioning. The gut then sends signals back to the brain, and that can, in turn, lead to feelings of anxiety, depression and social withdrawal. The cycle then repeats, so novel treatments addressing signals from both the brain and the gut may provide the most benefit for some kids with gastrointestinal disorders and autism.\xe2\x80\x9d Ferguson is currently involved in a clinical trial to assess how stress-reducing medication affects gastrointestinal problems.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p><a href="https://consumer.healthday.com/b-5-3-how-stress-and-gastro-issues-combine-to-harm-kids-with-autism-2657218770.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Original Article</a></p>\r\n<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-022-05539-6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Original Study Abstract</a></p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<div class="entry-footer">\n          <p class="entry-footer-info font-entryfooter"><span class="post-footers">Posted by <a rel="author" href="https://profile.typepad.com/rescuepost">Age of Autism</a> on May 18, 2022 at 06:00 AM in <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/science/">Science</a> </span> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="permalink" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/05/laugh-or-cry-researchers-catch-up-with-autism-parents-25-years-later.html">Permalink</a>\n\n \n\t<span class="separator"> | </span>\n\t\n\t\t\t <a class="entry-comments" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/05/laugh-or-cry-researchers-catch-up-with-autism-parents-25-years-later.html#comments">Comments (13)</a>\n\t\n\n\n          </p>\n\n\n          <!-- technorati tags -->\n\n\n\n          <!-- post footer links -->\n\t<p class="entry-footer-share entry-footer-share-buttons">\n\t\t<span class="entry-footer-links-twitter">\n     <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F05%2Flaugh-or-cry-researchers-catch-up-with-autism-parents-25-years-later.html&text=Laugh%20or%20Cry%3A%20Researchers%20C..." target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-twitter"></i></a>\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-plusone"></span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-pinterest">\n     <a href="javascript:void((function()%7Bvar%20e=document.createElement(\'script\');e.setAttribute(\'type\',\'text/javascript\');e.setAttribute(\'charset\',\'UTF-8\');e.setAttribute(\'src\',\'https://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=\'+Math.random()*99999999);document.body.appendChild(e)%7D)());"><i class="icon fab fa-pinterest"></i></a>\n\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-facebook_like">\n     \n     <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F05%2Flaugh-or-cry-researchers-catch-up-with-autism-parents-25-years-later.html" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-facebook"></i></a>\n     \n</span>\n\t</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n</article>\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n<!-- entry shared -->\n\n<article class="post entry">\n\n\n\n<!-- DISPLAY FULL POSTS-->\n\n     \n\n       <h2 class="entry-header font-entryheader">\n           \n        <span class="entry-title">\n<a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/05/rfk-jr-to-speak-at-humanity-against-censorship-rally-519-menlo-park-ca.html">RFK Jr To Speak At Humanity Against Censorship Rally 5/19 Menlo Park, CA</a>\n        </span>\n       </h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<div class="entry-body font-entrybody">\n\t\t\t\t<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e202942fab0a86200c-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Humanity-censorship-rfk-jr-free-speech-rally-feature-800x417" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8357f3f2969e202942fab0a86200c img-responsive" src="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e202942fab0a86200c-250wi" style="width: 250px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Humanity-censorship-rfk-jr-free-speech-rally-feature-800x417" /></a>From Children&#39;s Health Defense - whose focus is humanity. <br /><br /><a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/steve-kirsch-humanity-censorship-rally-rfk-jr-podcast/?itm_term=home" rel="noopener" target="_blank">RFK, Jr. to Speak at May 19 \xe2\x80\x98Humanity Against Censorship\xe2\x80\x99 Rally</a><br /><br />By Susan C.

April was autism whatever you want to call it month. And a quiet one it was. Not as many feel good stories. A few arguments over awareness versus acceptance. Some nattering about the puzzle piece versus the infinity rainbow symbol.&#0160; <a href="https://www.drbognerhealth.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Bogner, of Bogner Health</a> in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan wrote the post. I was unfamiliar with Dr. Bogner. He&#39;s a functional medicine practitioner. It felt affirming to read his words in a world where autism parents are hanging on for dear life behind closed doors. Over twenty years I took Mia and Gianna to their first DAN! (RIP) doctor, a then elderly allergist named Frank Waickman, who was a colleague of Dr. Rimland. After examining Mia and Gianna, he turned to me, 36 years old, pregnant with my third baby, and said, &quot;How are YOU doing, Kim? How are you taking care of yourself.&quot; I&#39;ve never forgotten that moment of human kindness. Thank you, Dr. Bogner, for your affirmation of the struggles.<br /><br />###</p>\r\n<p>To all YOU warriors\xe2\x80\xa6</p>\r\n<p>\xe2\x80\xa6standing at your son\xe2\x80\x99s ER bed while he is restrained getting injected with antipsychotics for his rage.<br /><br />\xe2\x80\xa6kneeling next to the bathtub at 2am while he is screaming and punching his face.<br /><br />\xe2\x80\xa6screaming while he beats you in the backyard and the neighbors calling the cops.<br /><br />\xe2\x80\xa6pulling over on the expressway while he pulls your hair so hard you almost flipped your car.<br /><br />\xe2\x80\xa6pleading with the cops not to arrest him after he beat up a kid in the supermarket\xe2\x80\xa6<br /><br />\xe2\x80\xa6ready to get in the car to pick him up early from school because he is punching himself in the chest 3000 times<br /><br />\xe2\x80\xa6holding him tight at night when he is shaking in bed wondering wtf is going on.<br /><br />Hardcore autism.

Another year races on, and real help for autism is at a low point. Go ahead and Google &quot;Autism,&quot; just the word. Then look at the news features. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/12/1098506522/nonspeaking-valedictorian-autism-college-commencement-speech" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Elizabeth Bonker is featured prominently</a>, which is terrific. She&#39;s the college Valedictorian who uses spelling to communicate. I will note, and I mean no disrepect to Elizabeth&#39;s success, NPR and other news outlets have written that she lost her speech at 15 months.&#0160; If she had lost her ability to walk, surely the reports would have said the reason. But regressive autism? Gloss over it and move on. The other news stories are all based on neurodiversity. I suppose we should be grateful there was not a drowning story. Mercury is in retrograde, I&#39;m told. And the world seems to be as broken as can be. I think we should revisit Mark&#39;s work. And remember our roots.&#0160; Deep and painful as they may be. <br /><br />###</p>\r\n<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e20278803cb8cb200d-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Mark Blaxill Chilren&#39;s March" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8357f3f2969e20278803cb8cb200d img-responsive" src="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e20278803cb8cb200d-250wi" style="width: 250px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Mark Blaxill Chilren&#39;s March" /></a>NOTE:&#0160; We&#39;ll have an audio file to accompany Anne&#39;s transcription.&#0160; This is part 1 of a 5 part series.

Caveat means warning.&#0160; It read: &quot;<em>Boobies! We set our snark meter to stun on this one.</em> Followed by, <em>Mandate breastfeeding to ease the formula shortage. Medically exempt moms can buy formula. Medical exemptions will only be granted by La Leche League, not your own Dr. It&#39;s for the health of babies. Don&#39;t complain</em>.&quot;&#0160; And.... madness ensued in the comments.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>Most readers got it - the irony. Others not so much.&#0160; I&#39;m not taking a stance pro or con breastfeeding. I&#0160; have three kids who had both. My Mom made formula for my brother with a Karo syrup recipe in 1970. I&#39;m fully aware not every Mom can breastfeed - for reasons personal to her. <br /><br />The nation would go into an uproar if breastfeeding was &quot;mandated&quot; to stretch the limited supply of formula for those who could not breastfeed. You know, for the greater good of babies. And yet, we just came off of a year and a half where men and women, Moms and Dads lost their jobs, were banned from all aspects of society and ostracized with glee across social and mainstream media for their Covid vaccination choice.&#0160; So I wrote a quick Tweet that was meant to point out how crappy medical mandates are.&#0160; All of them. <br /><br />If one person sees that vaccine mandates are just as intrusive as my imaginary Tweet topic was, it was worth losing some Facebook followers. <br /><br />Silence is submission. I won&#39;t be silent.</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<div class="entry-footer">\n          <p class="entry-footer-info font-entryfooter"><span class="post-footers">Posted by <a rel="author" href="https://profile.typepad.com/rescuepost">Age of Autism</a> on May 12, 2022 at 06:00 AM in <a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/current_affairs/">Current Affairs</a> </span> <span class="separator">|</span> <a class="permalink" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/05/flip-the-script.html">Permalink</a>\n\n \n\t<span class="separator"> | </span>\n\t\n\t\t\t <a class="entry-comments" href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/05/flip-the-script.html#comments">Comments (8)</a>\n\t\n\n\n          </p>\n\n\n          <!-- technorati tags -->\n\n\n\n          <!-- post footer links -->\n\t<p class="entry-footer-share entry-footer-share-buttons">\n\t\t<span class="entry-footer-links-twitter">\n     <a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F05%2Fflip-the-script.html&text=Flip%20The%20Script" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-twitter"></i></a>\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-plusone"></span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-pinterest">\n     <a href="javascript:void((function()%7Bvar%20e=document.createElement(\'script\');e.setAttribute(\'type\',\'text/javascript\');e.setAttribute(\'charset\',\'UTF-8\');e.setAttribute(\'src\',\'https://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=\'+Math.random()*99999999);document.body.appendChild(e)%7D)());"><i class="icon fab fa-pinterest"></i></a>\n\n</span> <span class="separator">|</span> <span class="entry-footer-links-facebook_like">\n     \n     <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com%2F2022%2F05%2Fflip-the-script.html" target="_blank"><i class="icon fab fa-facebook"></i></a>\n     \n</span>\n\t</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n</article>\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n<!-- entry shared -->\n\n<article class="post entry">\n\n\n\n<!-- DISPLAY FULL POSTS-->\n\n     \n\n       <h2 class="entry-header font-entryheader">\n           \n        <span class="entry-title">\n<a href="https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/05/us-fda-lowers-the-efficacy-bar-for-covid-vaccine-eua-for-toddlers-to-6.html">US FDA Lowers The Efficacy Bar for Covid Vaccine EUA for Toddlers to 6</a>\n        </span>\n       </h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<div class="entry-body font-entrybody">\n\t\t\t\t<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e20278807c4650200d-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Covid toddler" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8357f3f2969e20278807c4650200d img-responsive" src="https://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e20278807c4650200d-250wi" style="width: 250px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Covid toddler" /></a>Head shaking report at Children&#39;s Health Defense regarding the Emergency Use Authorization Pfizer and Moderna so desperately seek, as a gateway to landing on the CDC Pediatric vaccine schedule, which means guaranteed customers from 2 to eternity.&#0160; Can you imagine lowering the bar for efficacy, and subjecting toddlers to a vaccine that could be virtually ineffective yet have all of the risk?&#0160; And parents will cheer for the ability to dose their kids, thinking they are protecting them.
