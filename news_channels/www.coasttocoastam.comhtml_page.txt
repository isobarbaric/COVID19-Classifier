Forstchen\\u003c/a>, PhD, specializes in topics ranging from history and cultural issues, to space technology development, and the security implications of these combined topics. In the first half, he updated the ongoing campaign to bolster energy and communications infrastructure against EMP attack, solar flares, and other disasters. Huge, damaging solar flares happen about every 150-200 years, he reported (\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.newsweek.com/solar-eruption-could-headed-towards-earth-direction-cme-1719423\\" target=\\"_blank\\">just recently\\u003c/a>, a large coronal mass ejection- CME- was observed coming from the sun). If we were hit by a flare like the one in 1859 (known as the Carrington Event), it would be far more devastating today because of the magnitudes more technology we have.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>Forstchen postulated what would happen if America was struck by an EMP (military weapon that blows out the power grid). &quot;The first thing you\'re going to notice is you don\'t have water anymore,&quot; he warned. Further, the average community has only 20-25 days of food on hand; after that, they\'d be out of luck. People will start getting sick from lack of food and medicines, as well as contaminated water, and because it takes years to replace the power grid transformers, a large percentage of the population would die within the first year, he continued. Forstchen lamented that political efforts have stalled to protect or strengthen the grid, and noted that for $20-30 billion, we could get started by updating 5-7% of the grid with high-level capabilities. For more on the issue, he recommended visiting sites such as\xc2\xa0\\u003ca href=\\"https://securethegrid.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">securethegrid.com\\u003c/a>\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0\\u003ca href=\\"https://emptaskforce.us/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">emptaskforce.us\\u003c/a>.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>----------------\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>Professor\xc2\xa0\\u003ca href=\\"http://spiritualbrain.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Todd Murphy\\u003c/a>\xc2\xa0was a member of Laurentian University Behavior Neurosciences research group. He has published in the Journal for Near-Death Studies, Psychology Reports, the journal Neuroquantology and other scientific journals. In the latter half, he discussed his extensive studies in the neuroscience of spirituality, including near-death experiences, deja vu, precognition, and healing. In detailing how deja vu works, he noted that when memories aren\'t linear, they\'re more likely to be found in the right side of the brain in the hippocampus region, and if there\'s a disturbance in that area in the present moment, it may make your current experience feel like a recurrence of the past.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>He explained that our consciousness is an intrinsic property of a magnetic field, and intriguingly our brains have &quot;five million magnetite crystals per gram,&quot; which points to how telepathy could work. Murphy shared a healing technique that he learned in India. You get into a trance-like state and imagine there are holes in the palms of your hand, with healing energy flowing in and out of them. He discovered that the technique is greatly enhanced when strong emotions (like grief/sadness or joy) are entered into at the same time, particularly in hands-on healing. He also talked about visualizing a presence behind you to the left and right, which can be a way to get in touch with something like your guardian angel, and animal communication methods, in which a person focuses on powerful images rather than words.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>\\u003cem>News segment guests: \\u003c/em>\\u003ca href=\\"https://mishtalk.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">\\u003cem>Mish Shedlock\\u003c/em>\\u003c/a>\\u003cem>, \\u003c/em>\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.howardbloom.net\\" target=\\"_blank\\">\\u003cem>Howard Bloom\\u003c/em>\\u003c/a>\\u003cem> \\u003c/em>\\u003c/p>\\n\\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\\u003cul>\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"http://www.amazon.com/One-Second-After-William-Forstchen/dp/0765317583/ctoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">One Second After\\u003c/a>\\u003c/li>\\n\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"http://www.amazon.com/One-Year-After-William-Forstchen/dp/0765376709//ctoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">One Year After\\u003c/a>\\u003c/li>\\n\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.amazon.com/48-Hours-William-R-Forstchen/dp/0765397919/ctoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">48 Hours\\u003c/a>\\u003c/li>\\n\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Pathways-Brains-Religious-Experiences/dp/0615890482/ctoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Sacred Pathways: The Brain\'s Role in Religious and Mystic Experiences\\u003c/a>\\u003c/li>\\n\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.amazon.com/Deja-Other-Spiritual-Gifts-Enriching/dp/0692957650/ctoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Deja vu &amp;

Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \\u003ci>Journey to the Light\\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \\u003ci>Talking To The Dead\\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.\xc2\xa0 Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \\"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \\"most likely\\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there\xe2\x80\x99s still no sign of it whatsoever, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to think outside the box. \\u003cp>\\n\\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \\"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\\u003c/p>\\n\\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \\u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \\u003ci>Journey to the Light\\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \\u003ci>Talking To The Dead\\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.\xc2\xa0 Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \\"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \\"most likely\\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there\xe2\x80\x99s still no sign of it whatsoever, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to think outside the box. \\u003cp>\\n\\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \\"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\\u003c/p>\\n\\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \\u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\\u003c/p>\\n\\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\\u003cstrong>\\u003c/strong>\\u003c/p>\\n\\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \\"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory\xe2\x80\x99s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \\u003ci>Journey to the Light\\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \\u003ci>Talking To The Dead\\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.\xc2\xa0 Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \\"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \\"most likely\\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there\xe2\x80\x99s still no sign of it whatsoever, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to think outside the box. \\u003cp>\\n\\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \\"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory\xe2\x80\x99s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

Forstchen\\u003c/a>, PhD, specializes in topics ranging from history and cultural issues, to space technology development, and the security implications of these combined topics. In the first half, he updated the ongoing campaign to bolster energy and communications infrastructure against EMP attack, solar flares, and other disasters. Huge, damaging solar flares happen about every 150-200 years, he reported (\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.newsweek.com/solar-eruption-could-headed-towards-earth-direction-cme-1719423\\" target=\\"_blank\\">just recently\\u003c/a>, a large coronal mass ejection- CME- was observed coming from the sun). If we were hit by a flare like the one in 1859 (known as the Carrington Event), it would be far more devastating today because of the magnitudes more technology we have.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>Forstchen postulated what would happen if America was struck by an EMP (military weapon that blows out the power grid). &quot;The first thing you\'re going to notice is you don\'t have water anymore,&quot; he warned. Further, the average community has only 20-25 days of food on hand; after that, they\'d be out of luck. People will start getting sick from lack of food and medicines, as well as contaminated water, and because it takes years to replace the power grid transformers, a large percentage of the population would die within the first year, he continued. Forstchen lamented that political efforts have stalled to protect or strengthen the grid, and noted that for $20-30 billion, we could get started by updating 5-7% of the grid with high-level capabilities. For more on the issue, he recommended visiting sites such as\xc2\xa0\\u003ca href=\\"https://securethegrid.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">securethegrid.com\\u003c/a>\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0\\u003ca href=\\"https://emptaskforce.us/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">emptaskforce.us\\u003c/a>.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>----------------\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>Professor\xc2\xa0\\u003ca href=\\"http://spiritualbrain.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Todd Murphy\\u003c/a>\xc2\xa0was a member of Laurentian University Behavior Neurosciences research group. He has published in the Journal for Near-Death Studies, Psychology Reports, the journal Neuroquantology and other scientific journals. In the latter half, he discussed his extensive studies in the neuroscience of spirituality, including near-death experiences, deja vu, precognition, and healing. In detailing how deja vu works, he noted that when memories aren\'t linear, they\'re more likely to be found in the right side of the brain in the hippocampus region, and if there\'s a disturbance in that area in the present moment, it may make your current experience feel like a recurrence of the past.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>He explained that our consciousness is an intrinsic property of a magnetic field, and intriguingly our brains have &quot;five million magnetite crystals per gram,&quot; which points to how telepathy could work. Murphy shared a healing technique that he learned in India. You get into a trance-like state and imagine there are holes in the palms of your hand, with healing energy flowing in and out of them. He discovered that the technique is greatly enhanced when strong emotions (like grief/sadness or joy) are entered into at the same time, particularly in hands-on healing. He also talked about visualizing a presence behind you to the left and right, which can be a way to get in touch with something like your guardian angel, and animal communication methods, in which a person focuses on powerful images rather than words.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>\\u003cem>News segment guests: \\u003c/em>\\u003ca href=\\"https://mishtalk.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">\\u003cem>Mish Shedlock\\u003c/em>\\u003c/a>\\u003cem>, \\u003c/em>\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.howardbloom.net\\" target=\\"_blank\\">\\u003cem>Howard Bloom\\u003c/em>\\u003c/a>\\u003cem> \\u003c/em>\\u003c/p>\\n\\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\\u003cul>\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"http://www.amazon.com/One-Second-After-William-Forstchen/dp/0765317583/ctoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">One Second After\\u003c/a>\\u003c/li>\\n\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"http://www.amazon.com/One-Year-After-William-Forstchen/dp/0765376709//ctoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">One Year After\\u003c/a>\\u003c/li>\\n\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.amazon.com/48-Hours-William-R-Forstchen/dp/0765397919/ctoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">48 Hours\\u003c/a>\\u003c/li>\\n\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Pathways-Brains-Religious-Experiences/dp/0615890482/ctoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Sacred Pathways: The Brain\'s Role in Religious and Mystic Experiences\\u003c/a>\\u003c/li>\\n\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.amazon.com/Deja-Other-Spiritual-Gifts-Enriching/dp/0692957650/ctoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Deja vu &amp;

From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that.

Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \\u003ci>Journey to the Light\\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \\u003ci>Talking To The Dead\\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.\xc2\xa0 Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \\"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \\"most likely\\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there\xe2\x80\x99s still no sign of it whatsoever, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to think outside the box. \\u003cp>\\n\\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \\"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

The objectives of the Palmistry Institute are to further new advances in the field of hand analysis and to serve as a research and information resource. Its purpose is to restore the practice of palmistry to its rightful place as a respected and esteemed science. In 1979 he began formal training in Vedic (Eastern) cosmology which took him to India many times. He combines Western astrological palmistry with Chinese elemental hand analysis.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that.

Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \\u003ci>Journey to the Light\\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \\u003ci>Talking To The Dead\\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.\xc2\xa0 Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \\"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \\"most likely\\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there\xe2\x80\x99s still no sign of it whatsoever, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to think outside the box. \\u003cp>\\n\\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \\"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\\u003c/p>\\n\\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \\u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory\xe2\x80\x99s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \\u003ci>Journey to the Light\\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \\u003ci>Talking To The Dead\\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.\xc2\xa0 Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \\"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \\"most likely\\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there\xe2\x80\x99s still no sign of it whatsoever, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to think outside the box. \\u003cp>\\n\\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \\"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

Forstchen\\u003c/a>, PhD, specializes in topics ranging from history and cultural issues, to space technology development, and the security implications of these combined topics. In the first half, he updated the ongoing campaign to bolster energy and communications infrastructure against EMP attack, solar flares, and other disasters. Huge, damaging solar flares happen about every 150-200 years, he reported (\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.newsweek.com/solar-eruption-could-headed-towards-earth-direction-cme-1719423\\" target=\\"_blank\\">just recently\\u003c/a>, a large coronal mass ejection- CME- was observed coming from the sun). If we were hit by a flare like the one in 1859 (known as the Carrington Event), it would be far more devastating today because of the magnitudes more technology we have.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>Forstchen postulated what would happen if America was struck by an EMP (military weapon that blows out the power grid). &quot;The first thing you\'re going to notice is you don\'t have water anymore,&quot; he warned. Further, the average community has only 20-25 days of food on hand; after that, they\'d be out of luck. People will start getting sick from lack of food and medicines, as well as contaminated water, and because it takes years to replace the power grid transformers, a large percentage of the population would die within the first year, he continued. Forstchen lamented that political efforts have stalled to protect or strengthen the grid, and noted that for $20-30 billion, we could get started by updating 5-7% of the grid with high-level capabilities. For more on the issue, he recommended visiting sites such as\xc2\xa0\\u003ca href=\\"https://securethegrid.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">securethegrid.com\\u003c/a>\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0\\u003ca href=\\"https://emptaskforce.us/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">emptaskforce.us\\u003c/a>.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>----------------\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>Professor\xc2\xa0\\u003ca href=\\"http://spiritualbrain.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Todd Murphy\\u003c/a>\xc2\xa0was a member of Laurentian University Behavior Neurosciences research group. He has published in the Journal for Near-Death Studies, Psychology Reports, the journal Neuroquantology and other scientific journals. In the latter half, he discussed his extensive studies in the neuroscience of spirituality, including near-death experiences, deja vu, precognition, and healing. In detailing how deja vu works, he noted that when memories aren\'t linear, they\'re more likely to be found in the right side of the brain in the hippocampus region, and if there\'s a disturbance in that area in the present moment, it may make your current experience feel like a recurrence of the past.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>He explained that our consciousness is an intrinsic property of a magnetic field, and intriguingly our brains have &quot;five million magnetite crystals per gram,&quot; which points to how telepathy could work. Murphy shared a healing technique that he learned in India. You get into a trance-like state and imagine there are holes in the palms of your hand, with healing energy flowing in and out of them. He discovered that the technique is greatly enhanced when strong emotions (like grief/sadness or joy) are entered into at the same time, particularly in hands-on healing. He also talked about visualizing a presence behind you to the left and right, which can be a way to get in touch with something like your guardian angel, and animal communication methods, in which a person focuses on powerful images rather than words.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>\\u003cem>News segment guests: \\u003c/em>\\u003ca href=\\"https://mishtalk.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">\\u003cem>Mish Shedlock\\u003c/em>\\u003c/a>\\u003cem>, \\u003c/em>\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.howardbloom.net\\" target=\\"_blank\\">\\u003cem>Howard Bloom\\u003c/em>\\u003c/a>\\u003cem> \\u003c/em>\\u003c/p>\\n\\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\\u003cul>\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"http://www.amazon.com/One-Second-After-William-Forstchen/dp/0765317583/ctoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">One Second After\\u003c/a>\\u003c/li>\\n\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"http://www.amazon.com/One-Year-After-William-Forstchen/dp/0765376709//ctoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">One Year After\\u003c/a>\\u003c/li>\\n\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.amazon.com/48-Hours-William-R-Forstchen/dp/0765397919/ctoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">48 Hours\\u003c/a>\\u003c/li>\\n\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Pathways-Brains-Religious-Experiences/dp/0615890482/ctoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Sacred Pathways: The Brain\'s Role in Religious and Mystic Experiences\\u003c/a>\\u003c/li>\\n\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.amazon.com/Deja-Other-Spiritual-Gifts-Enriching/dp/0692957650/ctoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Deja vu &amp;

From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that.

Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \\u003ci>Journey to the Light\\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \\u003ci>Talking To The Dead\\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.\xc2\xa0 Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \\"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \\"most likely\\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there\xe2\x80\x99s still no sign of it whatsoever, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to think outside the box. \\u003cp>\\n\\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \\"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

Responding to a recent report that supplements aren\'t effective, he refuted the study saying they didn\'t look at supplementation of up to 90 different nutrients, which he considers necessary to maintaining good health. Wallach recommended a hair analysis/testing procedure that can show which minerals a person might be deficient in, and if they have exposure to toxic metals.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>As to supplements for building bone strength and marrow, he recommended MSM, a sulfur compound that enhances joints, cartilage, and ligaments, as well as collagen peptides, derived from such things as fish, poultry, and beef. A person\'s bone marrow is particularly important to their health, he added, as that is where white blood cells and antibodies are made. Questioned as to what is the healthiest type of fruit to eat, Dr. Wallach replied that the health and quality of produce varies with the kind of soil they\'re grown in. Some soils, for instance, might be a lot higher in different types of minerals, he explained.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>----------\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>\\u003ca href=\\"https://delphiellis.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Delphi Ellis\\u003c/a>\xc2\xa0is a counselor and mindfulness practitioner who has worked in a therapeutic setting since 2002. She started her helping career supporting people in grief, mainly those bereaved by murder and suicide. In the latter half, she discussed dreams and nightmares and how you can manage your mind at night, and get the most out of your nightly journeys. She spoke about the problem of insomnia and sleep deprivation, and how sometimes poor sleep can contribute to negative dreams or nightmares. It\'s a myth that everyone needs eight hours of sleep, she pointed out, as the ideal amount of sleep can vary among individuals and also changes as we age. Yet, for optimal rest, we should pay attention to our sleep hygiene, she advised, avoiding certain things like drinking too much coffee or exercising too close to bedtime.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>Ellis considers dreams our &quot;friends,&quot; as they can tell us things about ourselves that we might not see or be aware of in the waking state. Even though nightmares are often violent or scary, they, too, can send us valid messages. If someone can get to the bottom of what the nightmare is trying to say, &quot;that person might never have that dream again because they don\'t need it&quot; anymore, she continued. Keeping a dream journal is helpful for tracking when certain types of dreams occur-- for instance, nightmares may be more common when visiting with specific people during the day. She also suggested that we pay attention to the language we use during our waking lives. Statements like \'this is killing me\' or \'I\'m dying here\' could contribute to violence or aggression in dreams, as the dreaming mind plays off the words we use during the day.

Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \\u003ci>Journey to the Light\\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.

Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.\xc2\xa0 Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \\"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \\"most likely\\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there\xe2\x80\x99s still no sign of it whatsoever, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to think outside the box. \\u003cp>\\n\\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \\"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

In the first half, he expressed concerns over food shortages, and the selling of &quot;fake&quot; food. A great deal of investment has gone into developing plant-based meat substitutes like the Impossible Burger, which has ingredients that make it appear to bleed like real beef. The ethics of not killing animals is driving the popularity of some of these new plant-based foods, yet Olson believes that there is a larger agenda at work by the proponents of the Impossible Burger and related products-- they want to get rid of farm animals in general.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>By harnessing the environmental and animal rights movements, &quot;they\'re going after animal agriculture,&quot; he continued, reducing the need for cows, ducks, pigs, and chickens. A number of patents have been issued for the Impossible Burger, and Olson argued that the tech entrepreneurs behind such protein products were seeking an exclusive hold on the future food market once meats from animals are curtailed from grocery shelves and restaurants. Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine is associated with current food shortages as Ukraine provides 1/3 of the world\'s grain, he reported. Even in the US, we are starting to see such scarcities, he added, citing how a food kitchen that feeds the hungry was running low on staples like noodles and grain.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>-----------------\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>Born a devout Catholic, now a resolute atheist,\xc2\xa0\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.facebook.com/tom.reilly.549\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Tom Reilly\\u003c/a>\xc2\xa0lives in Drogheda, Ireland in a haunted castle and has taken on the might of academia regarding parts of Irish history. In the latter half, he shared ghost stories and myths from Ireland, as well lore on the famous Oliver Cromwell-- whom he says has been wrongly accused of some heinous war crimes. Paranormal investigations have been held at the castle where he lives, and a number of witnesses have reported seeing the &quot;White Lady,&quot; said to be the apparition of a woman who visited the castle in 1852, and subsequently drowned in the Irish Sea. Reilly also talked about the legend of banshees, said to travel among homes and then wail outside one of them when someone was about to die.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>Another haunted location, he mentioned, is the Hellfire Club built on a summit in Dublin, where some believe devil worship and cannibalism took place. According to Reilly\'s research into the controversial 17th-century English general, Oliver Cromwell, two unscrupulous individuals seemed to be personally responsible for creating the myth that Cromwell deliberately killed unarmed men, women, and children at both Drogheda and Wexford. Bizarrely, as a message from the King, after Cromwell died, his body was exhumed, and his head placed on a pike and displayed above Westminster Hall for nearly thirty years.

Less than a month later, the infamous Roswell incident occurred in New Mexico. Two esteemed UFO researchers joined George Knapp to discuss the 75th anniversary of both events and how these two occurrences changed the discussion about life in the universe. In the first half,\xc2\xa0\\u003ca href=\\"https://linktr.ee/GraemeR\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Graeme Rendall\\u003c/a>\xc2\xa0from the UK joined the show.

Yet, Rendall pointed out, the craft bore little resemblance to the\xc2\xa0\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/northwest/flying-saucers-became-a-thing-70-years-ago-saturday-with-sighting-near-mount-rainier/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">&quot;crescent-shaped&quot; sketch\\u003c/a>\xc2\xa0that Arnold was pictured with in newspaper accounts at the time.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>A number of sightings by military pilots followed in the wake of Arnold\'s report, Rendall noted, including in 1948 when George Gorman got into a dogfight with a fast-moving light or orb, and Thomas Mantell chased after an unidentified craft in his plane (Mantell didn\'t survive the incident, as he flew higher in the atmosphere than he had sufficient oxygen for). Rendall also covered early military projects like Grudge and Bluebook assigned to investigate UFOs but ended up trying to debunk cases or propose mundane explanations when something extraordinary had occurred.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>In the latter half, author\xc2\xa0\\u003ca href=\\"http://richarddolanpress.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Richard Dolan\\u003c/a>\xc2\xa0recalled various cases from the 1940s, including Roswell, where the military backtracked on the original UFO report of a crashed disc, and used different cover stories over the years, starting with a weather balloon. Dolan pointed out that Operation Mockingbird, a longstanding CIA/intelligence community manipulation of mainstream media, began around this time and may continue to this day. Starting in the 1960s and going forward, the intelligence community was known to infiltrate the UFO field with operatives who worked to discredit reports and evidence, he added, citing the MJ-12 documents as an example of this.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>The Arnold sighting and Roswell garnered the most publicity in 1947, but there was a whole wave of UFO reports in that period, he noted, including a significant set of sightings at Muroc Airfield (now called Edwards AFB). Yet, after the military debunked Roswell as a weather balloon, media coverage began to die off about UFOs in general, he explained. While 1947 is considered by many to be the kickoff of the modern UFO era, &quot;there were elements within the US national security apparatus that did already know about this phenomenon,&quot; he revealed. For instance, there was the unexplained &quot;ghost rocket&quot; seen over Europe in the summer of 1946, and the foo fighters during WWII, as well as rumors of prior crash retrievals like Cape Girardeau in 1941.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003ch2>KNAPP\'S NEWS:\\u003c/h2>\\n\\n\\u003cp>George Knapp shares recent items of interest, including his interview with Dr. Travis Taylor about his work on the UAP Task Force, and articles that look back on early UFO reports and revelations.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cul>\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.8newsnow.com/i-team/i-team-ufo-scientist-speaks-publicly-for-the-first-time-on-decades-of-work/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">I-Team: Physicist reveals he\xe2\x80\x99s a UFO hunter for the Pentagon\\u003c/a>\\u003c/li>\\n\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/18965673/weve-seen-ufos-for-75-years-pilots-have-died-chasing-them-we-are-powerless-to-stop-them-need-answers-says-author/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen UFOs for 75 years \xe2\x80\x93 pilots have died chasing them, we are powerless to stop them &amp; need answers, says author\\u003c/a>\\u003c/li>\\n\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"https://thedebrief.org/summer-of-the-saucers/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Summer of the Saucers\\u003c/a>\\u003c/li>\\n\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.wired.com/story/extreme-weather-2022-just-getting-started\\" target=\\"_blank\\">This Year\xe2\x80\x99s Extreme Weather Is Just Getting Started\\u003c/a>\\u003c/li>\\n\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"https://newsopener.com/news/science/do-animals-feel-pain-science-author-ed-yong-says-thats-the-wrong-question/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Do animals feel pain?

When we have an intention, a complex chain of events begins in our brains in fields of invisible energy, yet they influence the molecules of matter around us the way a magnet organizes iron filings. Award-winning researcher \\u003ca href=\\"https://mindtomatter.club/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Dawson Church\\u003c/a> (\\u003ca href=\\"http://www.DawsonGift.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">additional website\\u003c/a>) joined guest host \\u003ca href=\\"http://theawareshow.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Lisa Garr\\u003c/a>\xc2\xa0(\\u003ca href=\\"https://theawareshow.com/contact12/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">email\\u003c/a>) to discuss how our minds create matter with different intentions, producing different fields and different material creations.  Church described how chronic stress in the human body produces the hormone cortisol which degrades memory, learning, muscle mass, and digestion. This leads to susceptibility to disease and shorter life spans, he reported, adding &quot;it is absolutely essential that we learn to regulate ourselves.&quot; \\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>A short meditation each day can decrease stress and raise dopamine levels. &quot;The dopamine in the brains of meditators can rise up to 65 percent, so now you\'re getting this heroin-like substance in your brain\'s reward centers,&quot; he said. Church shared details from a clinical trial of two randomized groups: one practiced breathing exercises, the other group did meditation. Within 30 days, those who meditated had anatomical changes in their brains. &quot;The literal structure of their brains was changing,&quot; he revealed.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>------------------------------------------------\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>During the latter half of the program, world-renowned intuitive energy healer \\u003ca href=\\"http://cyndidale.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Cyndi Dale\\u003c/a> talked about her energy and chakra work, and how to heal using the power of light. Dale revealed she could see energy as a child, and thought others could too. &quot;I could see balls of energy around my mom and my dad and other people... I saw angels, I heard ghosts and spirits,&quot; she explained, noting whenever her mother was angry she would emit a red color. People surrounded by murky colors were in a bad mood and brighter colors indicated positive emotions, Dale added. She detailed an out-of-body experience she had at twelve years old, as well as why she shut down her intuition until she was nineteen when she decided to accept her psychic gifts.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>&quot;It\'s been known for decades that all living things... [are] really just made out of oscillating fields of light and sound,&quot; Dale continued, outlining three different kinds of light in the universe. Absolute light is a type of light in which there is no darkness and it exists everywhere, and existed before matter came into being at the Big Bang, she revealed. &quot;We\'re made out of it,&quot; she said. The other types of light include virtual which are quantum fluctuations that can change reality and create possibilities, and polarity which is the form of light in which we exist. Dale reported on medical and therapeutic care involving polarity light. You can correct imbalances in electrical and magnetic flow through visualization, she noted.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\\u003cul>\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"https://blissbrain.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Bliss Brain\\u003c/a>\\u003c/li>\\n\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.amazon.com/Energy-Healing-Trauma-Chronic-Illness/dp/0738761044/ctoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Energy Healing for Trauma, Stress &amp; Chronic Illness\\u003c/a>\\t\\u003c/li>\\u003c/ul>\\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NSZLFC/ctoc"},{"artist":"Blues Traveler","title":"Hook","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B000V63BMC/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cake","title":"The Distance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B00138GY5I/ctoc"},{"artist":"Paula Cole","title":"I Don\'t Want To Wait","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B00122TE5M/ctoc"},{"artist":"B-52\'s","title":"Roam","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B001LYX1JQ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Peter Gabriel","title":"Big Time","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B07D1G1M3B/ctoc"},{"artist":"Digable Planets","title":"Rebirth Of Slick (Cool Like Dat)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B07BQS5F8V/ctoc"},{"artist":"The Breeders","title":"Cannonball","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B073JFJ96Z/ctoc"},{"artist":"The Cars","title":"You\'re All I\'ve Got Tonight","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B001OB0VNK/ctoc"},{"artist":"No Doubt","title":"Sunday Morning","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B000WOXQDM/ctoc"},{"artist":"Carpenters","title":"Superstar","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B07FP6Q9Y7/ctoc"},{"artist":"Elvis Costello","title":"(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B000V6Q7LO/ctoc"},{"artist":"Yeah Yeah Yeahs","title":"Maps","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B075JVJDGS/ctoc"},{"artist":"Velvet Underground","title":"White Light/White Heat","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B07GLF7ZX9/ctoc"},{"artist":"The Smiths","title":"Ask","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B005TM12N8/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Inca-Dance/dp/B07P19JR8X/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e01dfc8cc137bf2442029c9","%2F5e012b0e537fd678a3ecf443"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa85e6d71999f70ab1b9d1"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Lisa Garr"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/healing","keywords/intention"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/62b83bc7e98d65a1b059006d","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Jun 25 2022 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/62b83bdce98d65a1b059006e","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Jun 25 2022 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/62b83bede98d65a1b059006f","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Jun 25 2022 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/62b83bfbe98d65a1b0590070","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Jun 25 2022 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"new_assets","caption":"The shape of a couple hugging with stars.","id":"%2F62b54ce8d68ef9859493531d","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/62b54ce8d68ef9859493531d","source_credit":"Getty Images","title":"","url":"asset://new_assets/62b54ce8d68ef9859493531d","use_caption":false}},"show_audio":{"type":"link","value":[]},"show_date":{"type":"date","value":1656165600137},"slug":{"type":"slug","value":"2022-06-25-show"},"summary":{"type":"html","value":"\\u003cp>Researcher \\u003ca href=\\"https://mindtomatter.club/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Dawson Church\\u003c/a> discussed how thoughts control the mind and how the brain creates material reality.

Throughout her fifteen years of research into the paranormal, Zimmerman recounted, she noticed how often eyewitnesses mentioned their pets\' reaction to encounters with UFOs or ghosts. In addition to being interesting on its own, animal reaction is also a valuable research tool, since animals are also witnesses and experiencers who can provide data and insight, she continued. The most common reactions by animals are panic and fear, which Zimmerman illustrated with accounts of dogs, cats, herds of deer, and birds scattering and hiding\xe2\x80\x94even harming themselves in the process. In addition to this reaction to the paranormal, animals are also commonly observed exhibiting fear and anxiety ahead of earthquakes and other natural disasters.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>Zimmerman also considered the question of why the Hudson Valley is, as she believes, &quot;the number one hotspot over the last one hundred years&quot; for unusual activity. In the early 1900s, for exampled, massive airships with brilliant lights reportedly hovered over the area for hours at a time. And for about seven years in the 1980s, &quot;tens of thousands of people were seeing massive silent triangles, boomerangs, V-shapes, and other craft as well,&quot; Zimmerman noted. These craft, according to witnesses, would fly low and hover for up to twenty minutes, with observers standing directly below.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>******************\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>\\u003ca href=\\"https://danbaldwin.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Dan Baldwin\\u003c/a>, who has invested more than fifteen years using his skills as a pendulum dowser to locate missing persons, and paranormal researcher and ufologist \\u003ca href=\\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/george-sewell/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">George Sewell\\u003c/a>, joined the show in the latter half to detail their research into events combining UFOs, reincarnation, and direct contact with the spirit world. Baldwin explained the difference between the popular conception of dowsing done with a forked stick and the type he practices, which involves a pendulum suspended with a string. Among the feats he and Sewell have achieved through dowsing, he claimed, are finding missing people, contacting alien abductors, and releasing spirits trapped on the Earth.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>Sewell elaborated on the story of Lindsey Higgins, a Louisiana woman who suffered from lifelong abdominal pain, seeing visions, and terrifying encounters aboard alien craft. She eventually contacted Baldwin and Sewell, who discovered through pendulum sessions with Higgins the &quot;highly evolved&quot; spirit of the ET who had been abducting her. By working with the ET, Sewell went on, he and Baldwin were able to ask the aliens to refrain from inflicting pain on Higgins, which they agreed to. Higgins, they claimed, has since been free from the pains that had tormented her in the past.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>\\u003cem>News segment guests: \\u003c/em>\\u003ca href=\\"http://myheartbook.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">\\u003cem>Christian Wilde\\u003c/em>\\u003c/a>\\u003cem>, \\u003c/em>\\u003ca href=\\"http://KevinRandle.blogspot.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">\\u003cem>Kevin Randle \\u003c/em>\\u003c/a>\\u003c/p>\\n\\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\\u003cul>\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.amazon.com/Hudson-Valley-UFOs-Linda-Zimmermann/dp/1937174018/ctoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Hudson Valley UFOs\\u003c/a>\\u003c/li>\\n\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.amazon.com/Animal-Reactions-UFOs-Linda-Zimmermann/dp/1937174034/ctoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Animal Reactions to UFOs\xc2\xa0\\u003c/a>\\u003c/li>\\n\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Investigator-Hauntings-Hudson-Valley/dp/0971232601/ctoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Ghost Investigator Volume 1: Hauntings of the Hudson Valley\\u003c/a>\\u003c/li>\\n\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.amazon.com/Paranormal-Pendulum-Dan-Baldwin/dp/B089HXV76W/ctoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">The Paranormal Pendulum\\u003c/a>\\u003c/li>\\n\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.amazon.com/Paranormal-Pendulum-II-What-Spirits/dp/B092CB5ZY2/ctoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Paranormal Pendulum II: What the Spirits Say\\u003c/a>\\u003c/li>\\n\\u003cli>\\u003ca href=\\"https://www.amazon.com/Paranormal-Pendulum-III-Abduction-Phenomenon/dp/B09XDVFQTD/ctoc\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Paranormal Pendulum III\\u003c/a>\\u003c/li>\\u003c/ul>\\n\\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"The Chase (Midnight Express)","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001FBZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"The Fox And The Lady","url":"http://www.amazon.com/Mystic-Island-Cusco/dp/B007GN1CHY/ctoc"},{"artist":"Nat King Cole","title":"Smile","url":"http://www.amazon.com/Very-Best-Nat-King-Cole/dp/B000F2CAMY/ctoc"},{"artist":"The The","title":"Lung Shadows","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000028UW/ctoc"},{"artist":"Blue Oyster Cult","title":"Don\xe2\x80\x99t Fear The Reaper","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004YTY8/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Rhythm Of The Wilderness","url":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007GN12Q0/ctoc"},{"artist":"Argent","title":"Hold Your Head Up","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001SMT/ctoc"},{"artist":"Edgar Winter","title":"Frankenstein","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000024Z3/ctoc"},{"artist":"Sting","title":"Desert Rose","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00001QGQI/ctoc"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Turn Around","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005OMTT/ctoc"},{"artist":"Enya","title":"Only Time","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000050XEI/ctoc"},{"artist":"Emerson Lake & Palmer","title":"Fanfare For The Common Man","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000050XEI/ctoc"},{"artist":"Moody Blues","title":"The Voice","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002GNC/ctoc"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Mea Culpa","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Mcmxc-D-Enigma/dp/B000002URV/ctoc"},{"artist":"Jimmy Durante","title":"I\xe2\x80\x99ll Be Seeing You","url":"http://www.amazon.com/As-Time-Goes-Jimmy-Durante/dp/B000002MNP/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003YY8/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dffc7bd537fd678a3ece3fd","%2F5e01db83537fd678a3ecfa8b","%2F62abd057a3ef00b0fd44aff7"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/UFOs","keywords/animals and the paranormal","keywords/pendulum dowsing","keywords/spirit world"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/62b5a245de79a91a05d81e1d","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Jun 23 2022 -

Agreeing with those analysts that the United States is on the edge of a recession, Lewis qualified his assessment, noting that it\'s important to put our situation into perspective. Inflation\xe2\x80\x94which often coincides with a recession\xe2\x80\x94goes in historical cycles, he explained, and is likely to subside soon. In addition, although a recession is likely, it probably won\'t be nearly as severe as the one that occurred in 2008\xe2\x80\x932009. The important thing for consumers is to resist panicking, which could lead them to prematurely sell off investments and make other financial missteps.\\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>Lewis also pointed to specific ways in which astrology reflects finance and economics.

McCallum told the story of his introduction to the world of the paranormal, when he was at Ohio\'s Mansfield Prison to work on a movie. He went on to describe the difference between ghostly entities in the United States versus the United Kingdom, where the experiences are more intense. Despite this intensity, he explained, most spirits aren\'t aggressive, and some are even friendly. McCallum stressed that a ghost hunter can also do a lot to set the tone of an investigation, however: introducing oneself and the equipment being used, as well as treating the inhabited area with respect, can put a spirit at ease and ensure a safer encounter. \\u003c/p>\\n\\n\\u003cp>Selene related her first time dealing with a cryptid, when she was also in Ohio to do ghost hunting. Her investigating led her to the forest, where she heard the guttural growl of a sasquatch. She turned to see a sasquatch only about twenty feet away. She\'s looking forward to an upcoming investigation of a haunted location in Ireland, where she and her team will use a range of equipment to look for ghosts.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\\u003c/p>\\n\\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \\u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory\xe2\x80\x99s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \\u003ci>Journey to the Light\\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \\u003ci>Talking To The Dead\\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.\xc2\xa0 Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \\"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \\"most likely\\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there\xe2\x80\x99s still no sign of it whatsoever, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to think outside the box. \\u003cp>\\n\\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \\"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.
