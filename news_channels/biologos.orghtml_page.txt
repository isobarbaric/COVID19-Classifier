world\'s leading scientists and geneticists, and the founder of BioLogos, where he is now a Senior Fellow. In his early scientific career, he discovered the gene for cystic fibrosis. Then he led an international collaboration that first mapped the entire human genome. For that work he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the National Medal of Science. In 2008 he was appointed to his current role as Director of the National Institutes of Health, where he has been overseeing the country\xe2\x80\x99s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, Collins wrote the best-selling book \\u003cem\\u003eThe Language of God\\u003c/em\\u003e. It tells the story of his journey from atheism to Christian belief, showing that science actually enhances faith. The tremendous response to the book prompted Collins to found BioLogos. He envisioned it as a forum to discuss issues at the intersection of faith and science and to celebrate the harmony found there. His reputation quickly attracted a large network of faith leaders, including Tim Keller, Philip Yancey, and NT Wright. These and others joined the BioLogos conversation and affirmed the value of engaging science as believers. BioLogos is now an organization that reaches millions around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn celebration of his world-class scientific accomplishments and deep Christian faith, Collins was awarded the Templeton Prize in 2020. It honors individuals who are \\"harnessing the power of the sciences to explore the deepest questions of the universe and humankind\xe2\x80\x99s place and purpose within it.\xe2\x80\x9d He joined a prestigious group of previous winners, including Mother Teresa, Francis Ayala, Charles Townes, Desmond Tutu, and Billy Graham.","post_title":"Francis Collins","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"francis-collins","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-02-07 17:45:31","post_modified_gmt":"2022-02-07 21:45:31","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http://biologos.keen-studio.com/?post_type=people\\u0026#038;p=313","menu_order":0,"post_type":"people","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","post_type_singular":"Person","post_type_plural":"People","featured_image":{"alt":"BioLogos - Francis Collins","caption":"","card":"https://wp.biologos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/about_history_fc-e1547658540440-640x360.jpg","thumbnail":"https://wp.biologos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/about_history_fc-e1547658540440-150x150.jpg","thumbnail-large":"https://wp.biologos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/about_history_fc-e1547658540440.jpg","full":"https://wp.biologos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/about_history_fc-e1547658540440.jpg"},"secondaryImage":null,"link":"https://biologos.org/people/francis-collins/","colorOverlay":null,"metaDescription":"","readingLevel":null,"authors":null,"colorAssociation":"burgundy","startDate":null,"location":null,"organizer":null,"staffRoles":[{"term_id":100,"name":"Founder","slug":"founder","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":100,"taxonomy":"staff-roles","description":"","parent":0,"count":1,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":142,"name":"Senior Fellow","slug":"senior-fellow","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":142,"taxonomy":"staff-roles","description":"","parent":0,"count":1,"filter":"raw"}]}},{"acf_fc_layout":"Feature","customAttributes":{"title":"","url":"","image":false},"layoutTitle":"","custom":false,"featuredObject":{"ID":410,"post_author":"5","post_date":"2018-09-06 12:27:30","post_date_gmt":"2018-09-06 12:27:30","post_content":"Katharine Hayhoe is an atmospheric scientist who studies climate change, one of the most pressing issues facing humanity today.

It tells the story of his journey from atheism to Christian belief, showing that science actually enhances faith. The tremendous response to the book prompted Collins to found BioLogos. He envisioned it as a forum to discuss issues at the intersection of faith and science and to celebrate the harmony found there. His reputation quickly attracted a large network of faith leaders, including Tim Keller, Philip Yancey, and NT Wright. These and others joined the BioLogos conversation and affirmed the value of engaging science as believers. BioLogos is now an organization that reaches millions around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn celebration of his world-class scientific accomplishments and deep Christian faith, Collins was awarded the Templeton Prize in 2020. It honors individuals who are \\"harnessing the power of the sciences to explore the deepest questions of the universe and humankind\xe2\x80\x99s place and purpose within it.\xe2\x80\x9d He joined a

In his early scientific career, he discovered the gene for cystic fibrosis. Then he led an international collaboration that first mapped the entire human genome. For that work he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the National Medal of Science. In 2008 he was appointed to his current role as Director of the National Institutes of Health, where he has been overseeing the country\xe2\x80\x99s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, Collins wrote the best-selling book \\u003cem\\u003eThe Language of God\\u003c/em\\u003e. It tells the story of his journey from atheism to Christian belief, showing that science actually enhances faith. The tremendous response to the book prompted Collins to found BioLogos. He envisioned it as a forum to discuss issues at the intersection of faith and science and to celebrate the harmony found there. His reputation quickly attracted a large network of faith leaders, including Tim Keller, Philip Yancey, and NT Wright. These and others joined the BioLogos conversation and affirmed the value of engaging science as believers. BioLogos is now an organization that reaches millions around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn celebration of his world-class scientific accomplishments and deep Christian faith, Collins was awarded the Templeton Prize in 2020. It honors individuals who are \\"harnessing the power of the sciences to explore the deepest questions of the universe and humankind\xe2\x80\x99s place and purpose within it.\xe2\x80\x9d He joined a prestigious group of previous winners, including Mother Teresa, Francis Ayala, Charles Townes, Desmond Tutu, and Billy Graham.","post_title":"Francis Collins","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"francis-collins","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-02-07 17:45:31","post_modified_gmt":"2022-02-07 21:45:31","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http://biologos.keen-studio.com/?post_type=people\\u0026#038;p=313","menu_order":0,"post_type":"people","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","post_type_singular":"Person","post_type_plural":"People","featured_image":{"alt":"BioLogos - Francis Collins","caption":"","card":"https://wp.biologos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/about_history_fc-e1547658540440-640x360.jpg","thumbnail":"https://wp.biologos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/about_history_fc-e1547658540440-150x150.jpg","thumbnail-large":"https://wp.biologos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/about_history_fc-e1547658540440.jpg","full":"https://wp.biologos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/about_history_fc-e1547658540440.jpg"},"secondaryImage":null,"link":"https://biologos.org/people/francis-collins/","colorOverlay":null,"metaDescription":"","readingLevel":null,"authors":null,"colorAssociation":"burgundy","startDate":null,"location":null,"organizer":null,"staffRoles":[{"term_id":100,"name":"Founder","slug":"founder","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":100,"taxonomy":"staff-roles","description":"","parent":0,"count":1,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":142,"name":"Senior Fellow","slug":"senior-fellow","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":142,"taxonomy":"staff-roles","description":"","parent":0,"count":1,"filter":"raw"}]},"custom":{"name":"","image":false,"website":"","biography":""}},{"type":"custom","person":false,"custom":{"name":"Jane Goodall","image":{"ID":12743,"id":12743,"title":"OTH0172-04","filename":"OTH0172-04-scaled.jpg","filesize":374319,"url":"https://wp.biologos.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/OTH0172-04-scaled.jpg","link":"https://biologos.org/podcast-episodes/jane-goodall-and-francis-collins-being-human/oth0172-04/","alt":"Jane Goodall headshot","author":"7","description":"","caption":"Jane Goodall in Gombe National Park [photo credit: JGI/Shawn Sweeney]","name":"oth0172-04","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":12742,"date":"2021-07-12 17:00:01","modified":"2021-07-12 17:08:58","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https://wp.biologos.org/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":2560,"height":1835,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://wp.biologos.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/OTH0172-04-150x150.jpg","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https://wp.biologos.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/OTH0172-04-300x215.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":215,"medium_large":"https://wp.biologos.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/OTH0172-04-768x551.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":551,"large":"https://wp.biologos.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/OTH0172-04-1024x734.jpg","large-width":1024,"large-height":734,"1536x1536":"https://wp.biologos.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/OTH0172-04-1536x1101.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1101,"2048x2048":"https://wp.biologos.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/OTH0172-04-2048x1468.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1468,"header":"https://wp.biologos.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/OTH0172-04-1920x720.jpg","header-width":1920,"header-height":720,"thumbnail-large":"https://wp.biologos.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/OTH0172-04-400x400.jpg","thumbnail-large-width":400,"thumbnail-large-height":400,"card":"https://wp.biologos.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/OTH0172-04-640x360.jpg","card-width":640,"card-height":360}},"website":"https://janegoodall.org/our-story/about-jane/","biography":"\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"\\u003eConsidered to be the world\\u0026#8217;s foremost expert on chimpanzees, Jane Goodall is best known for her 60-year study of social and family interactions of wild chimpanzees since she first went to Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania in 1960, where she witnessed human-like behaviors amongst chimpanzees.\xc2\xa0\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"\\u003eShe is the founder of the \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Goodall_Institute\\"\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"\\u003eJane Goodall Institute\\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"\\u003e and the \\u003c/span\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots_%26_Shoots\\"\\u003e\\u003cspan style=\\"font-weight: 400;\\"\\u003eRoots \\u0026amp;

In his early scientific career, he discovered the gene for cystic fibrosis. Then he led an international collaboration that first mapped the entire human genome. For that work he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the National Medal of Science. In 2008 he was appointed to his current role as Director of the National Institutes of Health, where he has been overseeing the country\xe2\x80\x99s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, Collins wrote the best-selling book \\u003cem\\u003eThe Language of God\\u003c/em\\u003e. It tells the story of his journey from atheism to Christian belief, showing that science actually enhances faith. The tremendous response to the book prompted Collins to found BioLogos. He envisioned it as a forum to discuss issues at the intersection of faith and science and to celebrate the harmony found there. His reputation quickly attracted a large network of faith leaders, including Tim Keller, Philip Yancey, and NT Wright.

In his early scientific career, he discovered the gene for cystic fibrosis. Then he led an international collaboration that first mapped the entire human genome. For that work he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the National Medal of Science. In 2008 he was appointed to his current role as Director of the National Institutes of Health, where he has been overseeing the country\xe2\x80\x99s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, Collins wrote the best-selling book \\u003cem\\u003eThe Language of God\\u003c/em\\u003e. It tells the story of his journey from atheism to Christian belief, showing that science actually enhances faith. The tremendous response to the book prompted Collins to found BioLogos. He envisioned it as a forum to discuss issues at the intersection of faith and science and to celebrate the harmony found there. His reputation quickly attracted a large network of faith leaders, including Tim Keller, Philip Yancey, and NT Wright. These and others joined the BioLogos conversation and affirmed the value of engaging science as believers. BioLogos is now an organization that reaches millions around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn celebration of his world-class scientific accomplishments and deep Christian faith, Collins was awarded the Templeton Prize in 2020. It honors individuals who are \\"harnessing the power of the sciences to explore the deepest questions of the universe and humankind\xe2\x80\x99s place and purpose within it.\xe2\x80\x9d He joined a prestigious group of previous winners, including Mother Teresa, Francis Ayala, Charles Townes, Desmond Tutu, and Billy Graham.","post_title":"Francis Collins","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"francis-collins","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-02-07 17:45:31","post_modified_gmt":"2022-02-07 21:45:31","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http://biologos.keen-studio.com/?post_type=people\\u0026#038;p=313","menu_order":0,"post_type":"people","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw","post_type_singular":"Person","post_type_plural":"People","featured_image":{"alt":"BioLogos - Francis Collins","caption":"","card":"https://wp.biologos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/about_history_fc-e1547658540440-640x360.jpg","thumbnail":"https://wp.biologos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/about_history_fc-e1547658540440-150x150.jpg","thumbnail-large":"https://wp.biologos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/about_history_fc-e1547658540440.jpg","full":"https://wp.biologos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/about_history_fc-e1547658540440.jpg"},"secondaryImage":null,"link":"https://biologos.org/people/francis-collins/","colorOverlay":null,"metaDescription":"","readingLevel":null,"authors":null,"colorAssociation":"burgundy","startDate":null,"location":null,"organizer":null,"staffRoles":[{"term_id":100,"name":"Founder","slug":"founder","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":100,"taxonomy":"staff-roles","description":"","parent":0,"count":1,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":142,"name":"Senior Fellow","slug":"senior-fellow","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":142,"taxonomy":"staff-roles","description":"","parent":0,"count":1,"filter":"raw"}]},{"ID":388,"post_author":"5","post_date":"2018-09-06 12:19:23","post_date_gmt":"2018-09-06 12:19:23","post_content":"Deborah Haarsma is President of BioLogos.
