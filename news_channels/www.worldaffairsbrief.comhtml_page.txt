Biden\xe2\x80\x99s approval ratings are at an abysmal 30 percent, and his policies are polar opposite of what he should be doing if he were serious about getting reelected. As every political scientist knows, when the economy is bad and people are suffering, a politician\xe2\x80\x99s chances of getting re-elected are slim to none\xe2\x80\x94especially when they keep telling people everything is fine. But as with every banana republic, the fundamentals don\xe2\x80\x99t matter unless the elections are fair, and ours have been compromised. We don\xe2\x80\x99t yet know how compromised they are and it would be shocking if Biden won again against Trump, who would surely run again. Even if a Republican candidate like Trump gets voted in, how different would the outcome really be? One of our biggest problems in America is that the Republican party is moving so quickly to the other side in domestic and social policy (think vaccines, shut-downs, gay rights, and so forth) that there\xe2\x80\x99s almost no viable opposition anymore. What few reliable constitutional conservatives we have in Congress are such a small minority anymore, they can\xe2\x80\x99t stem the tide.
