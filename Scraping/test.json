        "Answer:\n\nBefore we get into specifics, let's start with a quick overview of the types of tests for coronavirus.\n\n\n\nTypes of COVID-19 Tests\n\n\n\nThere are basically two types of tests for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19:\n\n\n\nVirus test\n\nThis test detects the virus (SARS-CoV-2) to help determine if you have a current infection. Although you can be infectious before showing any symptoms, the virus is best detected during the first week of symptoms (which is about two weeks after becoming infected from exposure) (Sethuraman, JAMA 2020).\n\n\n\nThere are two type of virus tests: the PCR and antigen test. Early in the pandemic, both tests had to be performed in a laboratory or clinic with special rapid, portable machines, but rapid, home-based PCR and antigen tests have become available. There are also at-home sampling kits by which you can collect your own sample and drop it off or mail it to a lab, which will report PCR results back to you.\n\n\n\nVirus tests are typically done by collecting a sample of mucous from a nose swab (typically from the nasopharynx or nostril) or saliva or oral swabs. There is some evidence that virus detection may be better with samples from saliva or the mouth or throat (Blythe, medRxiv 2021 \u2014 preprint; Wyllie, Correspondence in JAMA, 2020), but most tests (and all antigen tests) authorized for use in the U.S. rely on samples from the nose and the FDA has advised against using antigen tests designed for the nose to be used in the mouth. Nevertheless, a study in the Netherlands, showed that an antigen test (BD Veritor) was able to detect about 20% more positive cases using samples collected first from the throat (around the tonsils) and then from the nose than with samples just from the nose. The combined samples were also used on Roche's SD Biosensor (aka COVI9-19 At-Home Test) antigen test which was even more accurate than BD Veritor (Zwart, medRxiv 2022 -- preprint). (Interestingly, one antigen test in the UK utilizes a swab of the throat (tonsils) that is then used to swab one nostril.) An apparent benefit of sampling from the throat is that the virus appears at higher levels there about a day earlier than in the nose, although levels then rise higher in the nose and remain higher there for a longer period, as shown in a study of people in the UK given COVID-19 by being infected with virus in their nose (Killingly, In Review 2022 -- preprint). Using only a swab from the inside of the check, however, was shown to identify only 2 positive cases out of 22 that were positive with nostril swabs in a small study that used the Abbott BinaxNow antigen test (Schrom, medRxiv 2022 \u2014 preprint).\n\n\n\nThe PCR test uses a technique that amplifies genetic material (RNA) from the virus. This can take as little as a few minutes or several hours. The FDA has authorized at-home sampling kits with which you can collect your own sample and drop it off or mail it to a lab, which will report the results back to you. It has also authorized at-home PCR tests that take about 20 to 60 minutes. Home PCR tests are more expensive than home antigen tests but may detect infections earlier than antigen tests. (Sign in to see our reviews of home PCR tests from Cue, Detect, and Lucira, and to see our Top Pick among these.)\n\n\n\nAn analysis of tests performed among symptomatic and asymptomatic patients at Vanderbilt University Medical Center showed that the proportion of samples testing positive on PCR tests were twice as high at 2 pm than in the morning, decreasing later in the afternoon and evening. Researchers proposed this may indicate that test accuracy varies by time of day and could have public health implications (McNaughton, medRxiv 2021 -- preprint).\n\n\n\nUpdate: In addition to the many commercial PCR tests that have received Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA, the CDC has been producing its own, FDA-authorized, PCR test. More recently, the CDC developed a newer test that can simultaneously test for and distinguish between COVID, influenza A and influenza B, and, as of January 1, 2022, it will withdraw the older test. Sign in to find out why.\n\n\n\nThe antigen test identifies a protein (or \"antigen\") that is specifically found on the virus. Advantages of the antigen test are that it can provide results in as little as 15 minutes and can be produced at lower cost, lending itself to wider use in screening. In addition, only a nasal swab is needed from the nostrils, not a much deeper, nasopharyngeal swab. The downside with antigen tests is that they are more likely to provide a false negative result than a gene amplification test; that is, it's more likely to identify your sample as negative when you are actually positive. Consequently, negative results from an antigen test should be repeated within three days, but at least 36 hours later (or confirmed with a PCR test) for people who are at high-risk of infection \u2014 but a positive antigen result is highly likely to be accurate. False negatives may also occur with emerging viral variants, if the variants have significant mutations of the target antigen. However, most popular antigen tests in the U.S. target nucleocapsid antigen, which is still present in variants such as Delta and Omicron. Be aware of a common mistake made when reading rapid home antigen tests and that one of the chemicals in these tests can cause skin irritation and other symptoms if mishandled.\n\n\n\nSign in for details about benefits and limitations of rapid antigen testing for the Omicron variant and find out how likely are you to still be contagious if you test positive on a rapid antigen test after a 5-day isolation.\n\n\n\nBe aware that one of the chemicals home antigen tests can cause skin irritation and other symptoms if mishandled.\n\nSeveral home antigen tests have been authorized by the FDA and are available, such as Abbott BinaxNow Self Test, BD Veritor, CLINITEST, Flowflex, iHealth, InteliSwab, On/Go (AccessBio CareStart), Roche At-Home, and Quidel QuickVue. However, there important differences in the accuracy of these tests, their shelf-lives and stability in freezing temperatures, and their cost. Also, versions of some of these tests have been recalled. [Sign in for our comparison of antigen tests and our Top Picks.]\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody test\n\nThis test detects antibodies to the virus and requires blood \u2014 either a drop or a vial \u2014 to determine if you have been infected in the past and have developed some level of immunity. This test (also called a serology test) can be run in a laboratory or on a test strip, although even test strips must be used in an authorized facility, not at home.\n\n\n\nAs it takes time to develop antibodies that can be detected, antibody tests are most accurate when performed at least 20 days after the first disease symptoms and may be most accurate (in terms of not missing antibodies that are present) 4 months or longer after a positive virus test. This was shown in study of 486 COVID patients in California in which the likelihood of a positive antibody (IgG) test result increased with time after a positive virus test. Antibody tests were most accurate (~80%) among those ages 40 to 59 years and least accurate (~65%) among those 70+ or under 40. The tests were more accurate for men than women (79% vs 72%) (Vashisht, JAMA Netw Open 2021).\n\n\n\nTests focus on levels of the antibody IgG, which persists without much decline for several weeks, but may include levels of IgM which fall off more rapidly (Sethuraman, JAMA 2020). These tests look for antibodies to specific parts of the virus, namely its spike proteins (proteins on the outside of the virus that can bind to receptors on human cells) or nucleocapsid proteins (proteins inside the virus). An advantage to testing for antibodies to the nucleocapsid is that these antibodies can be easier to detect, however, antibodies to the spike proteins are believed to be more important in conferring immunity against the virus, as these antibodies may block viral entry into cells \u2014 although antibodies to nucleocapsid proteins may still serve as proxies for immunity. See Finding the Best COVID-19 Test \u2014 Antibody Test to learn which marketed tests target each protein.\n\n\n\nAlthough it is not recommended that antibody tests be relied upon to determine the effectiveness of vaccines, be aware that only tests that focus on antibodies to spike protein would be useful for this purpose because the authorized vaccines generate antibodies only to spike proteins. A negative result on a nucleocapsid antibody test provides no information about the effectiveness of a vaccine although it would suggest that a person has not had COVD-19. The list of authorized antibody tests below indicates whether a test focuses on spike, nucleocapsid, or both types of proteins.\n\n\n\nIf, at some point, tests for spike protein antibodies are indicated for assessing antibody response to COVID-19 vaccines, those that provide a quantitative or semi-quantitative measurement, will be more useful than those that provide only a yes/no answer. Sign in for more information about antibody tests that focus on the spike protein and are semi-quantitative, including one that is available from a major U.S. laboratory.\n\n\n\nNote: Avoid taking large doses \u2014 10,000 mcg or more \u2014 of biotin (a B vitamin) for several days before an antibody test, as biotin may skew results.\n\nSign in to learn which tests may be affected by biotin.\n\nAnother way our bodies fight the virus is with T cells. Preliminary research suggests that even if antibody levels are too low to be detected, people previously infected with the virus may produce enough T cell response to provide immunity (Sekine, MediRxiv 2020). However, currently authorized tests do not measure this type of immunity, and one should still apply distancing and health precautions regardless of test results.\n\n\n\nSome labs may provide you with an index value that reflects the strength of the antibody signal produced from your test. Higher antibody levels generate higher signals and higher index values. The interpretation of these index values depends on the test used. For example, for a particular test the cut-offs could be \"less than 1.01\" for negative, \"1.01 to less than 1.21\" for indeterminate, and \"greater than or equal to 1.21\" for positive (Theel, J Clin Microbio 2020). Or, there could just be a single cut-off index value of, say, 1.40 for positive, with anything below being negative (Example: Abbott Alinity -- https://www.fda.gov/media/137910/download). If you would like to know your index value, be sure to check that the lab you use provides the value.\n\n\n\nWho is checking these tests?\n\nTo speed the availability of tests, rather than put these through its normal approval process, the FDA has provided a special emergency use allowance (EUA) for tests that, although imperfect, may be useful at this time. So there are actually no FDA \"approved\" SARS-CoV-2 virus tests, but a list of \"FDA authorized\" tests. The FDA allowances are based on data submitted by the test manufacturers, but the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other government laboratories are now conducting independent tests of these tests and the FDA has been making the results public (see results in the Finding the Best COVID-19 Test section and watch for further announcements in our newsletter.)\n\n\n\nSeveral other organizations around the world have been testing the test and/or certifying virus and antibody tests. The European Union's has been certifying tests, conferring on them its CE (Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne) mark, and the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has been doing the same. Researchers in California, Denmark, and elsewhere have been testing the antibody tests.\n\n\n\nBe aware that in June 2020 the FDA warned consumers about at-home antibody tests being sold without FDA clearance or approval and issued warning letters to three companies selling these tests. Some of these tests were falsely labeled as FDA approved. [Update (August 19, 2020): The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that CLIA- certified laboratories are no longer required to notify the FDA, nor request its authorization, for tests they develop in-house. It is not clear what information about such tests will be maintained or published. This change could allow for novel tests to become available more quickly but eliminates oversight by the FDA, creating more of a buyer-beware situation. Labs may, voluntarily, still choose to apply to the FDA, and the FDA will continue to publish information about tests submitted this way. If in doubt, ask your doctor or lab if the test you are considering is authorized for use by the FDA. (Links to the FDA information are provided in the Finding the Best COVID-19 Test section.\n\n\n\nWhere to Get COVID-19 Tests\n\n\n\nVirus Test\n\nTo date, the FDA has permitted the use of over 90 virus tests. The vast majority must be performed on a sample collected in a medical setting, such as in a doctor's office, a diagnostic laboratory, or a drive-through facility, but the FDA has also begun authorizing at-home sample collection tests for the virus.\n\n\n\nLocal testing (often free)\n\nAlthough you can ask your doctor for a virus test, you may be able to arrange to get a virus test for free from your state or local government. You can also go to a diagnostic laboratory or testing center, including some pharmacies. The test may be covered by your insurance or the government based on an assessment of your risk level. Here are some examples of testing programs around the country.\n\nProject Baseline works with community based screening programs in locations in several states to offer free virus testing. You must fill out an online questionnaire and be accepted. You will then be given an appointment at local testing center where a sample will be collected with a self-nasal swab or a nasopharyngeal swab. The project is sponsored by the parent company of Google through its health unit, Verily, and a Google email account is needed to complete questionnaire online.\n\nRite Aid Pharmacies in some locations are participating in Project Baseline, providing testing at no cost to anyone 18+ years of age.\n\nCVS (including MinuteClinic and HealthHUB) had originally offered drive-up, rapid testing using the Abbott ID NOW system, a small, portable device that yields results in 13 minutes or less. Unfortunately, this system was been reported to yield a high percentage of false negative results due to lower sensitivity than other systems. That is, a negative result may need to be confirmed using another test (Basu, bioRxiv 2020 preprint). (For more details, see Finding the Best COVID-19 Test , below). Virus testing is still offered, but specimens are now sent to independent, third-party labs for processing, and test results are available in approximately three to four days.\n\nWalgreens offers drive-up testing in which you perform your own nasal swab. You sample is sent to a laboratory and you are notified by email or phone when results are available. (Originally results were promised within 24 hours).\n\nKroger Health offers public drive-thru and walk-up COVID-19 testing.\n\n\n\nAt-home tests\n\nThe FDA has authorized several fully self-administered virus tests (providing rapid results) or test kits (to be sent into a lab) for use at home. Currently, two of these (Abbott BinaxNOW Antigen Self-Test and Quidel QuickVue) can be purchased at pharmacies and take about 15 minutes. Note that these will not provide you with a digital pass for events, airlines, or restaurants. Another version of the BinaxNOW Antigen test (the \"home\" version) provides a digital Navica pass, but this test must be purchased online (at about twice the cost) and many venues may not accept the digital pass.\n\n\n\nUpdate: On October 1, 2021, 200,000 test kits of another COVID-19 home test were recalled due to a manufacturing defect causing false positive results (i.e., indicating that someone has COVID-19 when they do not). For details, including what to do if you've used this home test, sign in to the full answer, which also includes details about four other currently available at-home tests.\n\n\n\nAntibody Test\n\nAs with virus tests, many laboratories have received FDA approval to conduct antibody tests, some of which are very accurate. Although the FDA has not approved or authorized rapid, home tests for antibodies, many such tests are available in other parts of the world and some have been sold in the U.S. The FDA has authorized one rapid antibody test for use at point-of-care settings, i.e., non-laboratory medical settings such as in medical offices and pharmacies.\n\n\n\nThrough a local healthcare provider\n\nYour healthcare provider can arrange for you to get an antibody test if deemed appropriate. Blood would be drawn either by your provider or at nearby diagnostic laboratory. Similarly, many walk-in, urgent care centers can arrange for you to have the test, for a fee, which may be covered by your insurance. The samples are typically sent to a commercial laboratory, so results can take a few days.\n\n\n\nConsumer-initiated testing\n\nBe aware than in many cases, the cost of antibody tests may be covered by insurance if ordered by your physician or health care provider. Some labs will require payment for consumer-initiated tests, while others will bill your insurance. Be sure to check the payment policy of the lab you plan to use if requesting your own test. You can also check if your insurance company covers COVID-19 testing. Medicare often covers the full cost of COVID-19 virus and antibody tests. If you are uninsured, health care providers can submit a claim to have virus and antibody tests covered by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.\n\n\n\nQuestDirect allows consumers to request a COVID-19 IgG antibody test and pay for it online ($119 plus a $10.30 physician oversight fee). An appointment is made for a blood draw at one of Quest Diagnostics 2,200 patient service centers and test results are available online one to two days later. Interested consumers must not have experienced symptoms of COVID-19 for at least 10 days. Quest has stated that the testing will initially rely on antibody tests run on the Abbott Architect and EUROIMMUN systems.\n\n\n\nLabcorp also allows consumers to request a test directly through its website. According to the website, there is no up-front out-of-pocket cost for consumer initiated tests, but you will be charged a $10 fee for physician oversight services (there is no physician oversight fee if the test order comes directly from your own physician or healthcare provider). Labcorp will \"bill the cost of the COVID-19 IgG antibody test directly to your insurance carrier, or if uninsured, to the appropriate government program.\" Antibody tests offered by Labcorp include Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV02 (IgG), and DiaSorin SARS-CoV-2.\n\n\n\nYou can see how each of these tests compare in the Finding the Best COVID-19 Test section below.\n\n\n\nRapid, home tests\n\nThe FDA has not yet approved or authorized of the use of any rapid, home antibody tests but several have been approved by the European Union, which provides its CE mark (Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne) and/or by the Chinese National Medical Products Association (NMPA). In addition, research groups have been evaluating these tests. Some of these tests have been marketed in the U.S. without FDA approval or allowance.\n\n\n\nFinding the Best COVID-19 Test\n\n\n\nThere are now more than 90 virus tests (including a recently approved saliva test) and 22 antibody tests for COVID-19 authorized by the FDA. ConsumerLab has reviewed the data on their performance and assessed which appear to be the best antibody tests for COVID-19. We've added this information for ConsumerLab members. Sign in as a member or become a member now to learn how specific brands of virus and antibody tests compare, which currently appear to be the best, where to get them, and whether any of the tests can identify which variant caused an infection.\n\n\n\nWhat Does a Negative Antibody Test Mean?\n\nIf you took a coronavirus antibody test and it came back negative, it can mean one of several things:\n\nThe test was not sensitive enough to detect antibodies that existed. This is more likely if the test had a sensitivity of less than 100% (see Finding the Best COVID-19 Test \u2014 Antibody Test for sensitivities of FDA-authorized tests);\n\nfor sensitivities of FDA-authorized tests); You may have never had COVID-19;\n\nYou took the test too early -- generally less than 20 days after first disease symptoms, although, according to the CDC, some people may take longer; or\n\nYou didn't develop levels of antibodies high enough to be detected by tests -- which preliminary research suggests may happen in mild and asymptomatic cases (Long, Nature Med 2020).\n\nThere is currently not enough data to know if a negative result could result from taking the test too late. More research is needed to determine how long significant levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 persist.\n\n\n\nThe CDC cautions, \"Regardless of whether you test positive or negative, the results do not confirm whether or not you are able to spread the virus that causes COVID-19. Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.\"\n\n\n\nThis article will be updated as new information is obtained.",

        "Answer:\n\nN95 masks are the gold standard, but other good options exist if you do not have an N95, primarily KN95 masks and well-made, well-fitting, 3-layer cloth masks. Disposable surgical masks are also readily available but tend to leave gaps between the mask and face, reducing their usefulness (although there are ways to improve it).\n\n\n\nIf you want to find and buy a good mask that meets the guidelines of the U.S. CDC as well as the World Health Organization, go right to Best Cloth Masks You Can Buy.\n\n\n\nIf you want an N95 respirator, see Finding the Best N95 Masks section. If you want a KN95 respirator, see the Finding the Best KN95 Masks section.\n\n\n\nIf you want to make your own mask (which can be quite effective) see the Best combination of materials for making a mask section. We also identify what seem to be the best disposable filter materials.\n\n\n\nMasks can be used alone or, for increased protection, particularly for the eyes, with a face shield \u2014 which we have also reviewed.\n\n\n\nHere's what we cover in this answer:\n\nWhy and when you should wear a mask\n\nWhile vaccination to protect against COVID-19 has led to a decreased need for masking in certain situations, unvaccinated individuals are still advised to wear a mask when in public indoor settings. In addition, due to concerns about the spread of the Delta and Omicron variants, masks are recommended for fully vaccinated individuals when in indoor spaces with high community transmission rates, as well as for fully vaccinated individuals with compromised immune systems or who are taking immune-suppressing drugs. Masks are also required for all individuals, regardless of vaccination status, when required by federal, state, local, tribal or territorial laws (including local business and workplace guidance), on public transportation, and in healthcare settings. (Get more details about masking guidelines for fully vaccinated individuals in our article about COVID vaccines).\n\n\n\nAlong with social distancing, a mask provides additional protection from infecting others as well as preventing exposure. In addition, according to the CDC, \"cloth mask materials can also reduce wearers' exposure to infectious droplets through filtration, including filtration of fine droplets and particles less than 10 microns.\" A review of studies found that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses was 82% lower with physical distancing of 1 meter (3.3 feet) or more, compared with shorter distances, and protection might increase with additional distance. Face mask use could result in an 85% reduction in risk of infection versus no face mask, with stronger associations for N-95 or similar respirators, while surgical masks and multi-layered cotton masks were less effective but offered more protection than single-layer masks (Chu, Lancet 2020).\n\n\n\nAs wearing a mask may reduce the amount of virus to which a wearer is exposed, it has been postulated that even if a mask-wearing person becomes infected, the reduced viral load to which they were exposed may mean that they suffer a milder disease. For example, on cruise ships with COVID-19 outbreaks, the majority of infected patients (81%) were asymptomatic on a ship that had provided masks to all passengers and staff compared to only 18% of cases being asymptomatic on a cruise ship without masking (Gandhi, J Gen Intern Med 2020; Gandhi, N Engl J Med 2020).\n\n\n\nAnother benefit of wearing a mask is that, due to the heat and moisture of exhaled breath, masks have been shown to increase the humidity and temperature of inhaled air, which, researchers have proposed, may reduce the risk of respiratory infections such as COVID by promoting the clearance of pathogens in the lungs (Courtney, Biophysical J 2021 -- preprint).\n\n\n\nAlthough previously reserved for healthcare workers to due a shortages in supply, the CDC advised on January 14, 2022 that N95 and KN95 respirators may be worn by the general public, with the exception of surgical N95 respirators, which are standardized for fluid resistance, i.e. blood splatter, and continue to be reserved for use in healthcare settings. In its updated guidance regarding masks and respirators the agency stated, \"While all masks and respirators provide some level of protection, properly fitted respirators provide the highest level of protection.\" (See our reviews of N95 and KN95 respirators below.) It also emphasized that use of well-fitted masks and respirators are particularly important in high-risk situations and for people who may be at risk for more severe disease.\n\n\n\n[Note: On January 19, 2022, the U.S. government announced that it will make approximately 400 million N95 respirators available free of charge to the public, possibly as early as the week of January 24th. According to a New York Times article about the announcement, the N95s will be distributed through community centers and retail pharmacies and will be limited to three per person. Details about brands or models were not provided.]\n\n\n\nIf using a cloth or disposable mask, be sure it fully covers the nose and mouth. Clear panel masks are acceptable to facilitate communication with people who are hearing impaired or who otherwise need to see a speaker's mouth in order to communicate. In addition to fully covering the nose and mouth, masks should also fulfill the following guidelines:\n\nCloth masks should be made with two or more layers of a breathable fabric that is tightly woven (i.e., fabrics that do not let light pass through when held up to a light source). (See our Top Picks among cloth masks that meet these requirements. ) If gaiters are worn, they should have two layers of fabric or be folded to make two layers.\n\n) If gaiters are worn, they should have two layers of fabric or be folded to make two layers. Masks should fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face.\n\nMasks should be a solid piece of material without slits, exhalation valves, or punctures.\n\nScarves, ski masks, turtlenecks pulled over the face, masks made from loosely woven material, and masks with slits, exhalation valves, or punctures are not acceptable.\n\n\n\nFace shields and goggles can be worn with masks, but cannot be worn instead of a mask. (See our Top Pick among face shields).\n\n\n\nFailure to wear a mask as described above is a violation of federal law and can be enforced by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and state and local authorities. The TSA has proposed a fine of $250 for the first offense up to $1,500 for repeat offenders (TSA 2021). However, there are several exceptions to the requirement: Masks may be removed for brief periods of time when eating, drinking, or taking medication, while communicating with someone who is hearing impaired, when required to verify one's identity, and when requested by a ticket agent or law enforcement officer.\n\n\n\nAny benefit to wearing masks at home?\n\n\n\nAlthough CDC guidelines do not currently include the use of face masks at home, the rate of transmission from one household family member to another was 79% lower when members wore face masks prior to the first member developing COVID-19 symptoms, according to a study of 124 families in Beijing in which there was at least one infected person. Overall, there was a 23% rate of transmission of COVID-19 from an infected family member to another, but this was no lower when mask wearing began after the first member developed symptoms. These results are consistent with the fact that viral load is highest two days before symptoms and on the first day of symptoms. Daily use of disinfectants reduced transmission by 77%. Transmission rates were four times higher if the primary case had diarrhea and 18 times higher when there was frequent daily close contact (less than 3 feet apart). The researchers recommended use of face masks in families in which a member has been at risk of getting infected. In China, over 70% of transmission occurred within families (Wang, BMJ Global Health 2020).\n\n\n\nBest combination of materials for making a mask\n\nCurrently, both the CDC and WHO provide basic guidelines for choosing a cloth mask.\n\nAccording to CDC guidelines, a cloth mask should:\n\nUse a minimum of 2 - 3 layers, preferably with batting between the layers\n\nUse fabrics with high thread count and fine weave, water-resistant fabric, and hybrid fabrics such as cotton-silk, cotton-chiffon, or cotton-flannel (cotton blends may be better than pure cotton). (In addition, the CDC notes that, due to their electrostatic charge, materials such as polypropylene may enhance filtration efficacy and fabrics such as silk can help to repel droplets.)\n\nCover the nose and chin\n\nFit snugly on the sides of the face without gaps\n\nBe secured with ties or ear loops\n\nUse ties rather than ear loops because ties provide better fit\n\nIt also advises that if wearing a neck gaiter, choose one with two layers or fold it to make two layers.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the CDC warns not to choose masks that are:\n\nMade of fabric that makes it hard to breathe, such as vinyl\n\nHave exhalation valves or vents, as this allows virus particles to escape\n\nReserverd for healthcare workers (i.e. surgical N95s\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) provides more details about which types of fabrics may work best. It recommends using three layers of fabric for non-medical, cloth masks in order to achieve the best combination of filtration efficacy and breathability:\n\n\n\n1. Innermost layer: Hydrophilic material (i.e., one that can absorb moisture, such as cotton or cotton blends)\n\n\n\n2. Middle layer: Hydrophobic material (i.e., repels moisture) of synthetic non-woven material such as polypropylene or a second cotton layer which may enhance filtration or retain droplets.\n\n\n\n3. Outermost layer: Hydrophobic material (e.g., polypropylene, polyester, or their blends) which may limit external contamination from penetration through to the wearer's nose and mouth.\n\n\n\n(See Best Cloth Masks You Can Buy for our review of masks for sale that appear to meet the WHO requirements)\n\n\n\nNote that polypropylene, a material often used to make disposable surgical masks, has an electrostatic charge which can improve the filtration efficiency of masks. Polypropylene \"spunbound\" is sold in fabric and many other retail and online stores under brand names such as Oly*fun and Pellon. Polypropylene is sold in different weights (measured in grams per square meter or GSM). Most commercially manufactured surgical masks are made of 3-ply 25GSM. Polypropylene materials between 25 and 40 GSM tend to have similar filtration efficacy and breathability, while polypropylene 60 GSM has a higher filtration efficiency but less breathability (Zhao, Nano Lett 2020). Be aware that some forms of polypropylene should not be machine washed.\n\n\n\nSee below for a more detailed discussion of the filtration efficacy of various cotton and synthetic household fabrics.\n\n\n\nNote that Health Canada (the Canadian equivalent of the U.S. FDA) has advised against using face masks labeled as containing graphene (or biomass graphene) due to concerns that graphene particles might be inhaled (Health Canada April 2, 2021). Graphene is promoted for use in some masks as having antibacterial and antiviral properties. Preliminary research suggests that graphene particles may cause early lung toxicity in animals, but the agency noted that the \"potential for people to inhale graphene particles from face masks and the related health risks are not yet known, and may vary based on mask design.\" Health Canada has asked distributors in Canada to stop selling graphene masks while it investigates the safety of using graphene in masks, and advised that people who have used graphene face masks and \"have health concerns, or symptoms such as new or unexplained shortness of breath, discomfort or difficulty breathing,\" to consult with their healthcare provider. For examples of graphene masks sold in the U.S., sign in and read the full answer.\n\n\n\nStandards for masks\n\n\n\nASTM International, a non-profit organization that sets standards for medical masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE), has published voluntary standards for non-medical cloth face masks. Masks labeled \"Meets ASTM F3502\" must be shown, in an accredited laboratory, to meet one of two designations that will also appear on the mask label:\n\n\n\nLevel 1: Particle filtration efficiency of at least 20% and airflow resistance of < 15 mm H2O\n\n\n\nLevel 2: Particle filtration efficiency of at least 50% and airflow resistance of < 5 mm HH 2 O\n\n\n\n(For comparison, a NIOSH approved N95 must have an airflow resistance of no more than 35 mm H 2 O).\n\n\n\nMasks that claim to meet ASTM standards are also required to provide user instructions for size proper selection, proper use, and cleaning or disposal instructions.\n\nHow cotton and other household fabrics compare in blocking coronavirusdish cloth (85% polyester and 15% nylon) was slightly better -- 97.9%. In addition, most household fabrics were more breathable than the material in a medical mask. The dish cloth, for example, was twice as breathable as the medical mask (Aydin, medRxiv 2020 --preprint). (See the CDC website to learn how to make a cloth face covering.)\n\n\n\nTightly woven cotton, combined with silk or chiffon\n\nA study at the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory found that tightly woven, high-thread count cotton (600 thread-per-inch (TPI) sheet by Wamsutta) was more effective in filtering large droplets (similar to larger-sized SARS-CoV-2 droplets) than loosely woven cotton with a lower thread count (quilters cotton, 80 TPI), while fabrics with an electrostatic charge (such as silk and chiffon) were best for blocking aerosols -- the smaller sized droplets that remain suspended in air for extended amounts of time. Using layers of both fabrics, together, was most effective for blocking both large and small droplets. For example, two layers of 600 TPI cotton fabric had a large particle and small particle blocking efficacy of 99.5% and 82%, respectively, but one layer of 600 TPI cotton combined with two layers of chiffon (90% polyester, 10% spandex from Jo-Ann Stores) had a large particle and small particle blocking efficacy of 99.2% and 97% -- which, at low airflow rates (i.e., when not all air is drawn through the mask) is nearly as good as a properly-fitted N95 mask for blocking large particles and better than the N-95 with respect to small particles, of which only 85% are blocked by an N-95 mask). However, as emphasized in a published correction to the study, it is not known how efficient this fabric combination will be at normal or high rates of airflow when made into a fitted mask, i.e., when there are no leaks and all air flows directly through the mask, particularly when one is engaged in high levels of exertion. The researchers also found that small holes or leaks around the edges of the fabrics could decrease the blocking efficacy by 50% or more, and emphasized the importance of a good fit (snug and without gaps) (Konda, ACS Nano 2020). [Note: An illustration in the study shows the electrostatic layer of fabric as the inner layer when fabrics were combined. However, ConsumerLab contacted the author of the study who suggested that electrostatic fabric (such as chiffon) may be best used as the outer layer of the mask to avoid humidity from the nose or mouth, which could interfere with the electrostatic properties, but emphasized that was his suggestion, not something that was tested in the study.]\n\n\n\nCotton bandanas and handkerchiefs\n\nIn another study, researchers at Florida Atlantic University tested masks made from common household fabrics, as well a typical \"cone\" mask (often sold at pharmacies) to see how well they worked to stop droplets using a simulated model of coughing (a mannequin head through which liquid was manually pumped). Without any covering, droplets from the simulated cough traveled an average of 8 feet. With a bandana (single-layer, elastic T-shirt material, 85 threads per inch) droplets traveled an average of 3 ft. 7 inches, with a folded cotton handkerchief (as shown in this instructional video featuring the U.S. Surgeon General), 1 ft. 3 inches, and with a cone mask (CVS Cone Face Mask), 8 inches. The most effective mask was a stitched cotton mask (using two-layers of cotton quilting fabric, 70 threads per inch), with which droplets traveled just 2.5 inches. The researchers noted that \"healthcare professionals trained properly in the use of high-quality fitted masks will not experience leakage to the extent that we have observed in this study. However, leakage remains a likely issue for members of the general public who often rely on loose-fitting homemade masks.\" (Verma, Phys Fluids 2020).\n\n\n\nPolypropylene and surgical masks\n\nRather than focus on how far droplets travel, researchers at Duke looked at how well different masks block droplets during speaking. A fitted N95 mask without a valve was most effective in retaining droplets, with less than 1% of droplets being transmitted. The next most effective, in order, were a 3-layer surgical mask, a cotton-polypropylene-cotton \"apron\" mask, a 2-layer polypropylene mask, a 2-layer cotton pleated mask, and then an N95 with a valve.\n\n\n\nNeck gaiters (fleece, microfiber & polyester)\n\nThe Duke researchers found that two masks offered little protection: A double-layer bandana was only slightly more effective than using no face covering at all, while the worst face covering was a \"gaiter\" style neck fleece (often worn during running or sports) that showed a 10% increase in the number of droplets. The researchers suggested that the neck fleece material breaks larger liquid droplets into smaller droplets than can more easily be dispersed into the air (Fischer, Sci Adv 2020 \u2014 includes photos of the masks but no details about origin or brands). However, tests conducted by researchers at Virginia Polytechnic Institute found that, when measuring droplets that dispersed in an outward direction at a distance of about 1 ft. (30 cm), neck gaiters (one made of thin, 100% polyester (Chaos) and the other, a thicker, microfiber gaiter made of 87% polyester and 13% elastane (Cirque)) worked as well as a cloth mask (a no-sew mask made of cotton T-shirt material), blocking 100% of larger droplets (> 20 microns), 90% of droplets 5 microns in size, and 50% of 0.5 micron aerosols. They were somewhat less efficient than the cloth mask at blocking smaller aerosols, although when the thinner gaiter was doubled over, it blocked about 90% of droplets and aerosols (0.5 to 5 microns) (Pan, Virginia Tech PDF 2020).\n\n\n\nWhen doubled over, some neck gaiters may be more effective than a triple layer, all-cotton cloth mask. A study conducted by researchers at the CDC and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), found that a single-layer polyester neck gaiter (FKGIONG Sun UV Protection Neck Gaiter, 95% polyester, 5% Spandex) blocked 47% of outward moving cough aerosols (ranging in size from 0 to 7 microns) and when doubled over, blocked 60%. This was slightly better than a medical procedure mask with ear loops, which blocked 59% and a cloth mask made of 3 layers of cotton fabric and ear loops (Hanes Defender), which blocked 51%. An N95 respirator blocked 99% (Lindsley, medRxiv 2020 -- preprint). It should be noted that the cotton cloth mask tested did not have an outer layer made of hydrophobic material (such as polypropylene or polyester) as recommended by WHO. If wearing a neck gaiter, make sure it fits securely and consider choosing one with an adjustable cord, to help prevent it from falling down (off of the nose and mouth) during strong sudden movements, such as during a sneeze.\n\n\n\nWhich masks protect you best?\n\n\n\nA study that evaluated how well masks protect the wearer from breathing in small particles (ranging in size from 0.02 to 0.6 microns) and factored in the fit of the mask as well as its filtration efficiency found that a NIOSH approved N95 (3M 9210) had the highest filtration efficiency at 98%, followed by 80% for a medical procedure mask with ear loops (Cardinal Health) with nylon hosiery placed over it, and 71.5% for a surgical mask with ties. [Note: The filtration efficiency of the medical procedure masks can range dramatically depending on how it was worn.] The filtration efficiency was 74% for a 2-layer woven nylon mask with ear loops (Easy Masks LLC) with an aluminum nose bridge and nonwoven filter insert which, interestingly, had a slightly higher filtration efficiency after being washed once, 49.9% for a folded, cotton bandana, 39.3% for a single-layer woven polyester/nylon mask with ties (Renfro Corporation), 37.8% for a single-layer woven gaiter/neck cover balaclava bandana MPUSA LLC), 28.6% for a nonwoven polypropylene mask with fixed ear loops (Red Devil Inc), and just 26.5% for a 3-layer woven cotton mask (100% cotton) with ear loops (Hanesbrands Inc) (Clapp, JAMA Intern Med 2020).\n\n\n\nBest Materials for Making Your Own Mask Filter\n\nAs discussed above, the WHO recommends that the middle layer of a cloth mask be made of a synthetic, nonwoven fabric such as polypropylene, or a second layer of cotton (high thread count cotton has been shown to have better filtration efficacy than lower-thread cotton). Many cloth masks that you can buy online come with a \"filter pocket\" as the middle layer, which you can buy pre-made filters for, or add your own. We've reviewed common materials for making mask filters, including Filti Face Mask Material and Medline Dry Baby Wipes, as well as materials such as polypropylene and other non woven fabrics (100% polypropylene, Pellon Sew-In Interfacing and Oly*fun), cotton and quilter's cotton. Sign in as a member or join now to see our reviews and more details about materials for making your own mask filters.\n\n\n\nHow Cloth, N95, KN95 and other Masks Compare\n\nAs noted above, well-constructed cloth masks may reduce your risk of exposure to virus-containing particles, but their main purpose is to help protect others from potentially infectious particles that you may emit. They generally do not provide the same level of protection to the wearer as N95 or KN95 respirators. The extent to which cloth masks can filter particles (filtration efficiency) can vary widely depending on the type of fabrics used, the number of layers, and the fit. Cloth masks are also not held to the same standards as N95 and KN95 respirators, as they do not have to be tested by a government agency or meet standardized criteria in order to be sold. If you choose a cloth mask, be sure to it meets basic CDC and WHO guidelines. You can also look for cloth masks that has been tested and shown to meet voluntary ASTM standards. A cloth mask that has received a \"Level 2\" designation has been shown to have a particulate filtration efficiency \"of at least 50%.\"\n\n\n\nIn comparison, NIOSH approved particulate N95 respirators have been tested by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a division of the U.S. CDC. They must meet certain minimum criteria, including a particular filtration efficiency of at least 95%, an inhalation resistance of < 25 mm H20 and an exhalation resistance of <35 mm H20 (these are measures of how difficult is to breath in and out while wearing the respirator). Unlike cloth masks, NIOSH approved N95s are also required to attach to the head with head straps, rather than ear loops, as head straps can provide a more secure fit and reduce gapping.\n\n\n\nKN95 respirators, the Chinese \"equivalent\" of N95 respirators, must meet similar standards, including a particular filtration efficiency of at least 95%, and limits for inhalation and exhalation resistance. They are not required to have head straps (most have ear loops), although some do. Be aware that, during the pandemic, there have been many reports of counterfeit KN95s sold in the U.S., so you need to be careful where you buy KN95s.\n\n\n\n(For more about the differences between N95s and KN95s and quality concerns, see Are KN95 respirators as good as N95s?).\n\n\n\nSign in to see CL's Reviews of Popular N95 Respirators.\n\nBest Cloth Masks You Can Buy\n\nIf you prefer to purchase a cloth mask, we reviewed many masks sold online and identified several that we believe best meet WHO guidelines and/or are constructed with materials that offer a good combination of filtration efficacy and breathability. We also considered features that can affect fit and comfort, such as adjustable/bendable nose wires and adjustable straps, which can be particularly important for people who wear glasses or hearing aids. We also reviewed oversized masks designed to accommodate beards or to be used when singing, and masks with clear panels to enable lip reading by others.\n\n\n\nIn addition, we assessed eyeglass fogging with each mask when worn in cool air.\n\n\n\nOur list starts with our overall Top Pick for quality, comfort and breathability, fit, and minimal eyeglass fogging. This is followed by our next favorites, as well as masks for those who need clear panels. In our review of masks, we considered those from Allet, Atelier, Giftington, Graf Lanzt, LA Linen, Proper Cloth, Rafi Nova, Stark's, Tom Bihn, Vertex, Vida, Vistaprint, and masks sold on Etsy.\n\n\n\nBe aware that there is a shipping fee for most masks, calculated before check out based on location and/or other factors. Most companies provide an estimated time for the product to ship, but delivery time will depend on the shipping option you choose. ConsumerLab.com derives no revenue from sales of these products.\n\n\n\n(To see our list of the best cloth masks you can buy, sign in. If you are not a ConsumerLab member, join now.)\n\nHow to reduce air leakage around a mask\n\nAir leakage around a mask reduces the level of protection it provides you and those around you. There are several ways to reduce air leakage, as discussed below. Also be aware that if you are infectious, the area of your face beyond a leak, including eyeglasses, may become contaminated due to exhaled droplets, as demonstrated in OSHA study (Stephenson, medRxiv 2021 -- preprint).\n\n\n\nKnotting ear loops\n\nThe fit and filtration efficiency of medical procedure masks with ear loops can be significantly improved by knotting the ear loops and then tucking in and flattening the extra material close to the face (see illustration), according to research conducted on manikins by the CDC. This was shown to reduce exposure to aerosols from a cough by 64.5%.\n\nDouble masking\n\nWearing a medical mask (i.e., a blue \"procedure\" mask) under a cloth mask improves protection, (likely by minimizing leaks between the medical mask and skin), but wearing a medical mask over a cloth mask has less benefit. A study found that wearing a medical mask under a cloth mask increased the filtration efficiency of cloth masks (which, alone, were 41 to 44% efficient), as well as medical masks (which, alone, were 43 to 62% efficient). Adding a medical mask beneath a cloth mask increased fitted filtration efficiencies to 66% for a simple cotton ear-loop mask, 77% for a cotton bandana, and 81% for a gaiter. Doubling a medical mask was not as effective, nor was doubling cloth masks \u2014 which also reduced breathability (Sickbert-Bennett, JAMA Intern Med 2021).\n\nNose wires\n\nBe aware that, while adding a nose wire to masks can improve their fit (and therefore, possibly reduce air leakage and improve protection). They seem to be of benefit with stiffer masks but; but not with masks made with stretchy or more flexible material (O'Kelly, medRxiv 2021 -- preprint).\n\nTry not to bend over while wearing a mask\n\nResearchers at Columbia University who were fit testing N95 respirators found that normal breathing and talking did not negatively affect mask fit, and turning the head from side to side slightly improved fit (perhaps due to tightening). However, moving the head up and down slightly worsened fit, and bending over decreased proper fit by as much as 50%. The researchers suggested kneeling rather than bending over when wearing a mask (Chen, medRxiv 2020 -- preprint).\n\nMask fitters\n\nMasks fitters are a \"frame\" that can be placed over masks to improve the fit and \"seal\" of the mask against the face to reduce air leakage and increase inhalation filtration efficiency. Using mannequins that could \"breathe,\" researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that placing either of two marketed mask fitters over a variety of masks increased inhalation filtration efficiencies from just 7% without the fitter to 26% for a 4-ply cotton mask, from 52% to 63% for a 3-ply spunbond polypropylene mask, from 44% to 91% for a surgical mask, and from only 18% up to as much as 95% for a 3-ply disposable non-medical mask with a melt-blown polypropylene center. Sign in to learn make a mask fitter at home or buy either of the two used in the study.\n\n\n\nNylon stockings\n\nAnother way to reduce air leaks was suggested by a study at Northeastern University in Boston, which showed that pulling an 8 to 10-inch tube of nylon (cut from a queen-sized nylon stocking) down over a regular mask and to the top of the neck. This significantly prevented air leakage around the mask and improved particle filtration efficiency, making the combined masking nearly as effective as an N-95 respirator which, unlike a medical mask, has an electrostatic charge and is specifically designed to prevent air leakage (Mueller, medRxiv 2020 --preprint; Godoy, NPR.org 4/22/20).\n\n\n\nSimilarly, a study found that adding a sleeve of nylon hosiery over a medical procedural mask with ear loops (Cardinal Health Inc) increased its overall filtration efficiency from just 38.5% to 80%. Other techniques that created a better fit for the procedure mask to reduce air leakage included tying the ear loops and tucking in the side pleats (see video demonstration), which increased filtration efficiency to 60.3%, or securing the ear loops with ear guards (61.7%), a hair clip (64.8%) or placing three rubber bands across the front of the mask and looped on the ears (78.2%) (Clapp, JAMA Intern Med 2020).\n\nHow to reduce eyeglass fogging from masks\n\nOur tests indicated that eyeglasses were less likely to fog in cool air with masks that 1) came up higher on the nose and cheeks (allowing glasses to sit over the edge of the mask 2) had a bendable top frame that could be contoured for a close fit around the nose and cheeks, 3) had adjustable ear or head bands, allowing the mask to be tight against the face, and 4) had an outer layer of 100% polyester or chiffon rather than a cotton or cotton/polyester blend. Find out which masks had the least fogging.\n\n\n\nLens fogging may also be minimized by rinsing lenses with highly diluted liquid soap and then air drying (stand lenses up so excess drips off) (Hu, J Emerg Nurs 2020). This leaves a surfactant film that reduces surface tension and causes water molecules to spread out evenly into a transparent layer, reducing fogging (Margrain, Ann R Coll Surg Engl 2011). Anti-fogging sprays and wipes are also sold, but be sure to follow directions and allow liquids to dry before wearing to avoid eye irritation or injury from the liquid. (A CL member reported severe eye irritation after using JAWS Spit Gel which seems to have gotten into his eye after a COVID nasal test that caused eye tearing) (Peng, Cornea 2006). Eye injury has also been reported in healthcare workers in China who used anti-fog spray on medical goggles (Hu, J Emerg Nurs 2020).\n\n\n\nSingle-sided and double-sided tape strips can also be used to seal the edges of masks around the eyes and nose to reduce fogging. ConsumerLab purchased two tape strip products sold on Amazon, MaskTite Adhesive Strips and Cabeau Tape. We tried each with the masks in this review, and with a disposable mask, while wearing glasses. [Sign in to see our reviews of these tapes and our mask reviews.]\n\nHow to clean a cloth mask\n\nThe CDC advises that cloth masks be washed daily (and after high exposure) with soap and water. The agency also suggests each person have at least two cloth masks, likely so that one can be used while the other is being cleaned. It notes that \"cloth can be used for an extended period as long as they are not wet or soiled, but do not reuse them unless washed and cleaned.\" Masks should not be worn while still wet, as the agency states that the filtration effectiveness may be reduced. The FDA recommends choosing a cloth mask that can be washed and machine dried without damage or change in shape.\n\n\n\nCloth masks can be washed in a washing machine. They can also be cleaned using heat, but a washing machine is preferred. Silk and chiffon fabrics may need to be hand washed with cold water.\n\n\n\nIf you've purchased a mask, check with the fabric manufacturer or see the care instructions on the label. If hand washing is required, be sure to use adequate soap/detergent and rinse thoroughly, as soap helps to break down the lipid layer that allows SARS-Cov-2 to attach to surfaces. Some sturdier silk and chiffon blends, such as poly-spandex-chiffon, can be machine washed with warm water and tumbled dry if placed in a mesh bag for delicates.\n\n\n\nRe-using N95s?\n\nCurrently, the CDC recommends re-using a single N95 respirator no more than five times. It also advises healthcare workers \"wear one N95 FFR each day and store it in a breathable paper bag at the end of each shift with a minimum of five days between each N95 FFR use, rotating the use each day between N95 FFRs,\" noting that this \"will provide some time for pathogens on it to \"die off\" during storage.\"\n\n\n\nA study of 3M N95 respirators (dome-shaped duckbill models) worn by healthcare workers at Johns Hopkins Hospital caring for COVID-19 patients found that all N95s worn less than 12 times (and stored between uses) passed seal check and fit testing. Even when used about 40 times, 83% still passed these tests. The study implied that the masks had not been subject to decontamination procedures but they may have been somewhat protected from pathogen contamination as they were typically worn with face shields (Fabre, medRxiv 2020 -- preprint).\n\nPreventing mask-related skin irritation and acne\n\nKeeping masks clean can also help prevent skin irritation, acne, and other skin conditions that can be caused by or exacerbated by wearing a mask, including eczema (contact dermatitis), rosacea, and folliculitis (inflammation/infection of hair follicles). Although the term \"maskne\" has become a common term to describe skin irritation and eruptions after wearing masks, contact dermatitis appears to be the most common skin irritation associated with wearing masks. All of these conditions can be aggravated by humidity within the mask, increased bacterial load on the skin, and friction from mask material. In addition to replacing and/or cleaning masks regularly, dermatologists recommend applying light moisturizer 30 minutes before putting on your mask and maintaining good oral hygiene to help minimize the risk of skin irritation. You can find more information and the full list of tips for skin care when wearing masks in this article (see \"General measures to prevent PPE related facial dermatoses\") (Rud, BMJ 2021).\n\nEffect on breathing function and potential carbon dioxide buildup\n\nWhen wearing an N95 respirator or a well-fitted mask with high blocking efficiency there can be some carbon dioxide buildup inside the mask over time (Sinkule, Ann Occup Hyg 2013). According to researchers at Stanford University, N95 masks are \"are estimated to reduce oxygen intake by anywhere from 5 to 20 percent. That's significant, even for a healthy person. It can cause dizziness and lightheadedness.\" However, a small study in the U.S. found that wearing an N-95 mask for up to one hour did not cause any significant adverse effects in healthy healthcare workers performing moderate activities, despite significantly decreased inhaled oxygen and increased inhaled carbon dioxide levels (Roberge, Respir Care 2010). A representative from the CDC told Reuters.com that \"...the level of CO2 likely to build up in the mask is mostly tolerable to people exposed to it. You might get a headache but you most likely [would] not suffer the symptoms observed at much higher levels of CO2. The mask can become uncomfortable for a variety of reasons including a sensitivity to CO2 and the person will be motivated to remove the mask. It is unlikely that wearing a mask will cause hypercapnia [elevated blood levels of carbon dioxide].\"\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, surgical masks (also known as medical masks), which are inherently not as well-fitting as N95 respirators, do not lead to CO2 intoxication or oxygen deficiency, as noted by the World Health Organization. Several studies have demonstrated this. For example, a study among 20 healthy adults showed that moderate exercise (walking on a treadmill) for one hour while wearing a surgical mask led to only slight, clinically non-significant changes in CO2 levels (as measured on the skin) compared to exercise without a mask (Respir Physiol Neurobiol 2012). Even during vigorous exercise (cycling to exhaustion, an average of about 10 minutes) a study among 14 healthy men and women showed that wearing a disposable surgical mask or a three-layer cloth mask (Washable 3D Face Mask, TriMax Sports Inc. \u2014 made with bamboo charcoal cloth, non-woven fabric, and Lycra) had no effect on blood or muscle oxygenation or exercise performance compared exercising without a mask (Shaw, Int J Environ Res Public Health 2020).\n\n\n\nFurthermore, a study of 10 healthcare workers (including individuals with controlled asthma and four smokers), found that wearing a surgical mask (AFLUID, made of three layers of polypropylene and one layer of liquid resistant polyethylene) continuously for four hours did not reduce breathing function (Ciocan, Med Lav 2020). Additionally, older adults who wore a three-layer disposable nonmedical face mask with ear loops (Boomcare DY95 model, Deyce Leather Co Ltd) for one hour showed no decline in self-reported blood oxygen levels (as measured by pulse oximeter) (Chan, JAMA 2020).\n\n\n\nAnother study showed that, even among older adults (average age 71) with breathing difficulty due to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), wearing a surgical mask during a six-minute walk test did not result in any major changes in CO2 retention (Samannan, Ann Am Thorac Soc 2020). The researchers suggested that discomfort while wearing a surgical mask might be caused by the increased warmth of facial skin and inhaled air inside the mask, which may trigger sensations of anxiety or claustrophobia in some people.\n\n\n\nThe CDC advises that face masks should not be placed on children under the age of two, anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone who would not be able to remove the mask without assistance.\n\nInhalation of microplastics and OPEs\n\nConcern has been raised about the risk of inhaling microplastic particles when wearing a mask made of polypropylene or other materials containing plastics. A study in China found that most masks increased the inhalation of fiber-like microplastics but notably decreased the risk of inhalation of spherical particles. While some evidence has suggested that fiber-like microplastics may be more toxic to animals than spherical microplastics (Ziajahromi, Environ Sci Technol 2017), the investigators concluded that, overall, inhalation of microplastics from masks is a small problem compared to the risk of spreading COVID-19 without a mask, as people already regularly inhale high amounts of microplastics from the air, with or without a face mask.\n\n\n\nThe study found that only N95 respirators reduced the risk of inhaling fiber-like microplastic particles compared to not wearing a mask, while a nonwoven mask, a fashion mask, and a cotton mask increased it by 17%, 41%, and 54%, respectively, surgical masks increased it by about 4% to 73%, and activated charcoal mask increased it by 117%. Inhalation of spherical microplastic particles was reduced by about 47% to 96% for all masks compared to not wearing a mask.\n\n\n\nDisinfecting any of the masks with UV irradiation, alcohol, air blower treatment, washing with soap and water, or exposure to sunlight increased the microplastic inhalation risk compared to untreated masks, although the risk was only small following washing with water and was lowest following exposure to sunlight. Alcohol disinfection increased the risk of microplastic inhalation most significantly (Li J Hazard Mater 2020).\n\n\n\nPolypropylene and other plastic materials used to make KN95 respirators, medical, surgical and other types of masks are often treated with organophosphate esters (OPEs) which, at high concentrations and with prolonged exposure to OPEs through ingestion, inhalation, or skin contact have been linked with cancer and other adverse effects. Sign in to the full answer to see what researchers found when they looked at the risk of inhaling OPEs when wearing masks.\n\nAre KN95 respirators as good as N95s?\n\nN95 and KN95 masks (or, more technically, respirators) are designed to protect you, as well as others around you. Both are supposed to filter 95% of particles down to 0.3 microns. However, as discussed below, this isn't always the case with widely sold KN95 masks (which are designed to meet Chinese, rather than U.S. specifications). In addition, while N95 respirators attach with head bands to help ensure the best fit, most KN95s attach with ear loops, which may cause a loose or improper fit, and allow for air leakage. A study of N95 and KN95 respirators have shown that mask performance depends, in part, on the tightness of the contact between the material and the facial skin and masks that tied around the head outperform those with elastic ear loops (Sickbert-Bennett, JAMA Intern Med 2020). As discussed above, how you move while wearing a mask may also affect fit.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, due to the previous shortage of N95 masks, in April 2020 the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) provided guidance that KN95 masks certified to China's GB2636 standards of 2006 or 2019 (imprinted on masks as \"GB2626-2006\" or \"GB2626-2019\") \"will provide greater protection than surgical masks (i.e., facemasks, other than surgical N95s[3]), homemade masks, or improvised mouth and nose covers, such as bandanas and scarves.\" Caution: You should not buy a KN95 mask that does not have its GB2626-2006 or GB2626-2019 imprinted on it.\n\n\n\nTests of KN95s from China by the CDC show that the filtration efficacy of some KN95 masks is 95% or higher but can be as low as 5.3%. Furthermore, tests by ECRI, an independent, U.S. based non-profit organization that evaluates equipment for hospitals and healthcare systems, showed that 5 of 11 KN95s did not meet the filtration efficiency standard of 95%. ECRI also found large variations in filtration efficiencies of KN95s within the same lot from a single manufacturer, suggesting quality control issues. (You can download ECRI's test results, which includes manufacturer information and photos of the respirators tested by clicking on \"PPE Testing Report\" on this page on ECRI's site).\n\n\n\nBuying a KN95\n\nStarting in 2020, the FDA published and maintained a list of N-95 and KN95 respirators from China given emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA during the pandemic. However, as of July 6, 2021, due to the increased supply and availability of NIOSH-approved respirators, the FDA has revoked its authorization of non-NIOSH approved respirators manufactured in China for healthcare workers. Respirators with previous EUA status may still be marketed to the general public, but must be labeled as face masks, rather than respirators.\n\n\n\nUpdate: On August 25, 2021, the FDA announced that federal approval of respirators made by particular manufacturer has been revoked due to concerns about the quality of the products. Sign in for the details.\n\n\n\nFinding the Best KN95 Mask\n\nN95 masks are currently very hard to find and purchase as they remain reserved for healthcare and frontline workers. In contrast, KN95 masks are widely available for purchase on websites such as Amazon. However, it can be very difficult to know if a KN95 mask is genuine and effective. We reviewed many KN95 masks sold on Amazon but found only one currently on the FDA's list of authorized respirators that we recommend, and we found two that should be avoided. We also found an FDA-authorized KN95 through an online direct distributor in the U.S.\n\n\n\nThe CDC publishes a list and images of dozens of counterfeit and falsely marketed respirators. Signs of a counterfeit respirator include no approval number or NIOSH markings, decorative fabrics or add-ons, and claims of being approved for children.\n\n\n\nOther respirators\n\n\n\nBefore N95 respirators became more available, the United States Department of Labor, noted that healthcare workers who were unable to obtain N95 respirators could use R95, R99, P95, P99, P100 and others respirators. Like N95 masks, these are expected to filter out a minimum of 95% of particles of the most penetrating size, and those ending in a \"99\" or \"100\" filter out at least 99% or 99.97%, respectively, of such particles but can be more difficult to breathe through. R95 and P95 masks are typically used for protection when working with oil-based substances like fuel, paints, solvents, or pesticides. N95s are not resistant to oil, R95s are \"somewhat resistant\" and P95s are \"strongly resistant to oil or oil proof,\" as shown in the CDC's infographic about these types of masks. If considering an alternative respirator, make sure it is NIOSH approved. Respirators with exhalation valves should not be used when trying to protect others. (See a video demonstration by researchers at Florida Atlantic University of how aerosols can spread when coughing while wearing an N95 mask with a valve).\n\n\n\nKF94 respirators from Korea are often promoted as the Korean \"equivalent\" to N95 respirators, but this is not quite accurate. Although they can have relatively high filtration efficacy, KF94 masks are considered \"public use\" respirators and are not held to the same performance standards as Korea's Special 1st class \"occupational use\" respirators (which are considered to be roughly equivalent to NIOSH approved N95 masks). KF94 respirators are designed to have a filtration efficacy of 94%, and CDC tests of one brand of KF94 found its filtration efficacy to be even higher (99.85 to 99.94%). However, unlike all NIOSH-approved N95s (which attach with head bands), KF94 respirators attach with ear loops, which, the CDC points out, may compromise their fit and efficacy. The CDC did not perform fit testing on the KF94s it tested and noted a lack of information about manufacturing quality control. In addition, unlike surgical N95 respirators, KF94 respirators are not considered fluid resistant (Kim, J Korean Med Sci 2020).\n\n\n\nElectrical air purifying respirators that mimic powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) are available on Amazon, ranging in price from about $60 to $100, but these devices would not be suitable for preventing the spread of COVID-19 among the general public. These devices include a portable high efficiency (HE) filter that can be connected to a face mask via a flexible hose/air duct to supply fresh air to the wearer. By ventilating air from the HE filter to the mask, these devices should create positive air pressure. This means that air exhaled by the wearer would leak out of the mask. Consequently, these devices might protect the wearer if the ventilation is strong enough, but they would not protect individuals nearby the wearer.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, unlike NIOSH-certified PAPRs, which are rated as being more effective than N-95 masks, available electrical air purifying respirators do not appear to be certified. Therefore, it is uncertain if these devices even help protect the wearer. In addition, similar to other personal (\"wearable\") air purifiers, these devices might not be permitted on airplanes, as security officers can confiscate these devices if they feel they are unsafe or cause a threat.\n\n\n\nAre copper masks better?\n\n\n\nCopper has been shown to inactivate a wide variety of bacteria and some viruses, typically within minutes to hours of contact, and a study found that SARS-CoV-2 (at about 72\u00b0F and 40% relative humidity) was undetectable on copper after four hours (van Dormalen, NEJM (correspondence) 2020). There do not appear to be studies showing how effective masks made with copper or copper infused fabric are against SARS-Cov-2. However, preliminary research with other viruses suggests a possible benefit. A study funded by the maker of copper masks (Cupron) for healthcare and institutional use, showed that an N95 mask with two added layers of copper oxide infused material (polypropylene fabric containing 2.2% weight/weight copper particles) had a similar filtering efficacy as a regular N95 mask, but was much more effective in inactivating human influenza A virus (H1N1) and avian influenza virus (H9N2) (Barkow, PLoS One 2010). A University of Massachusetts Amherst microbiologist developed a reusable mask made of 99.95% pure copper mesh, which, according to a university news release, was shown to \"kill 90% of microbes within five minutes of contact.\" In Hong Kong, the government is distributing fabric masks to the public that contain copper, known as the CuMask+ (Parry, BMJ 2020). According to the manufacturer, CuMask+ is made up six layers, \"two of which are specially made with small quantities of copper.\" Tests published by the company suggest it retains antiviral activity with up to 60 washes (handwashed with soap and cold water). If you use a copper-containing mask, be sure to clean it regularly and according to the product instructions: Bacteria and viruses can cling to dirt or other particles on copper, making it less effective (Grass, Appl Environ Microbiol 2011).\n\n\n\nSome concerns have been raised about the safety of copper masks and the possibility of breathing in copper particles. While we don't have safety information for specific products, laboratory studies that measured the amount of copper released from copper oxide impregnated masks during 5 hours under simulated breathing conditions was far below the respiratory copper permissible exposure limit (PEL) set by the USA Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") (Borkow, Curr Chem Biol 2012).\n\n\n\nHow to protect yourself from COVID-19 in a car\n\n\n\nPreliminary research suggests that viral loads can quickly build up within a closed car, even during rides as brief as 15 minutes. Wearing a mask, as well as a face shield, are good first steps to help protect yourself and others. When there are two people in a car (one driver and one passenger) seating the passenger in the back seat on the opposite side of the driver creates the most distance between them. To increase ventilation, computer modeling research shows that riding with all windows down is most effective. Since this isn't always practical, the next most effective way to increase ventilation is by opening one window in the back and one in the front, opposite of where the occupants sit, creating airflow across the interior of the car. Keeping all the windows closed and running the air-conditioning, is least effective (Mathai, Sci Adv 2020). Keep in mind that none of these steps eliminate the risk of infection.\n\n\n\nHow to improve safety for bus passengers and drivers\n\n\n\nA study of aerosol flow on a school bus and transit bus that were driven under real-world conditions showed that mask wearing and ventilation can significantly reduce exposure to aerosols for passengers (Edwards, medRxiv 2021 -- preprint). Based on their experiments, the researchers recommended the following tips to help reduce exposure to aerosols for bus passengers:\n\nRequire all passengers and drivers to wear masks on buses. Even a cloth mask that's 50% efficient can reduce particles released from a cough by 50% and reduce their dispersal by several feet.\n\nOpen windows partially or fully. This can reduce airborne particles by 50% to 80%.\n\nConsider seating arrangements that only allow for same household or same cohort passengers to sit together.\n\nSocial distancing of six feet is not practical on most buses, but any extra distance allows the air movement to reduce exposure to infectious particles.\n\nFor bus drivers, the researchers recommended risk could be reduced by using a dashboard fan to create airflow in the driver seat area. They also noted that, when safe to do so, opening all transit bus doors at every stop would allow for better air exchange.\n\n\n\nWhat masks protect against wildfire smoke?\n\n\n\nCloth masks, including those with sewn-in or removable filters, should not be relied on for protection from wildfire smoke, according to the CDC. They protect against some of the larger particles in wildfire smoke, but not from smaller particles in smoke that can damage the lungs. In addition, one-strap paper dust masks and surgical masks, worn alone, are not recommended for wildfire smoke protection.\n\n\n\nIt is recommended that people who have to be outdoors in wildfire affected areas wear fit-tested, NIOSH-approved N95 or P100 respirators, and the CDC notes that properly fitted N95 respirators can \"provide protection from wildfire smoke and from COVID-19 for the individuals wearing them.\" To help prevent the spread of COVID-19 to others, N95 masks without valves are recommended. If an N95 mask with a valve is your only option for wildfire smoke protection, consider covering the valve with tape or wearing a surgical mask over the N95 when around others, as recommended by John Balms, M.D. at UCSF. According to the CDC, KN95 respirators can also provide protection from wildfire smoke, and advises looking for a KN95 that meets requirements similar to those set by the CDC's NIOSH (see our Top Pick among KN95 masks, which was tested by the CDC).",

        "To the Editor:\n\nAs of June 2022, the B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been divided into five distinct sublineages: BA.1, BA.2, BA.3, BA.4, and BA.5.1 Most circulating omicron variants belong to sublineage BA.2; however, the prevalence of BA.2.12.1 (a subvariant of BA.2), BA.4, and BA.5 is increasing rapidly in several regions of the world.2 Previous studies have shown that the BA.2 subvariants have sensitivities to some monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies that are lower than those of the ancestral strains and other SARS-CoV-2 variants.3-5\n\nAs compared with BA.2, the BA.2.12.1 subvariant has substitutions L452Q and S704L in its spike protein, and both BA.4 and BA.5 have additional changes. Substitutions L452Q, L452R, and F486V are in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, the major target for monoclonal antibody therapies, which is worrisome with respect to the effectiveness of current monoclonal antibodies that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) against these variants. The efficacy of monoclonal antibodies against the BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5 subvariants that have been isolated from patients is unknown.\n\nIn this study, we examined the neutralizing ability of FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies, individually and in combination, against omicron BA.2.12.1 (hCoV-19/USA/NY-MSHSP-PV56475/2022), BA.4 (hCoV-19/USA/MD/HP30386/2022), and BA.5 (hCoV-19/Japan/TY41-702/2022) isolates. We confirmed that the BA.5 isolate had five additional amino acid changes (69\u201370del, L452R, F486V, and Q493) in its spike protein as compared with a BA.2 isolate (hCoV-19/Japan/UT-NCD1288-2 N/2022) (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). The BA.2.12.1 isolate consisted of a mixed viral population encoding either R or W at position 682, in addition to having L452Q and S704L substitutions. The BA.4 isolate contained a V3G mutation in the signal peptide region of the spike protein, in addition to the other five changes (i.e., 69\u201370del, L452R, F486V, and Q493).\n\nTable 1. Table 1. Efficacy of Monoclonal Antibodies and Antiviral Drugs against Omicron Subvariants in Vitro.\n\nLive-virus focus reduction neutralization testing (FRNT) showed that monoclonal antibody REGN10933 (marketed as casirivimab) lost neutralizing activity against BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5 (Table 1 and Fig. S2). However, REGN10987 (marketed as imdevimab) retained neutralizing activity against these isolates. The combination of casirivimab and imdevimab also inhibited BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5; however, the value of this combination was higher (indicating reduced neutralizing activity) on 50% focus reduction neutralization testing (FRNT 50 ) by a factor of 131.6 against BA.2.12.1, by a factor of 133.5 against BA.4, and by a factor of 317.8 against BA.5 than against the ancestral strain (SARS-CoV-2/UT-NC002-1T/Human/2020/Tokyo) used in our study. COV2-2196 (marketed as tixagevimab) had neutralizing activity against BA.2.12.1 (although its FRNT 50 value for this virus was higher by a factor of 54.7 than against the ancestral strain) but not against BA.4 or BA.5. However, COV2-2130 (marketed as cilgavimab) neutralized BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5. The combination of tixagevimab and cilgavimab inhibited BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5, with a low FRNT 50 value (38.1 ng per milliliter, 37.8 ng per milliliter, and 192.5 ng per milliliter, respectively). However, as compared with the FRNT 50 value against the ancestral strain, the FRNT 50 value of this combination was higher by a factor of 6.1 against BA.2.12.1, by a factor of 6.0 against BA.4, and by a factor of 30.7 against BA.5. The precursor of sotrovimab (S309) lost inhibitory capability against BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5. Of the FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies that we tested, only LYCoV1404 (marketed as bebtelovimab) efficiently neutralized BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5; the FRNT 50 values for these isolates were similar to those for the ancestral strain.\n\nRemdesivir and molnupiravir (inhibitors of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2) and nirmatrelvir (an inhibitor of the main protease) have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). We therefore tested these antiviral drugs by determining the in vitro 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of each compound against BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5. As compared with the amino acid sequence of the reference strain Wuhan/Hu-1/2019, all three isolates encoded the P314L mutation in their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the P3395H mutation in their main protease (Fig. S3). The susceptibilities of BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5 to the three compounds (with higher values indicating reduced susceptibility) were similar to those of the ancestral strain (SARS-CoV-2/UT-NC002-1T/Human/2020/Tokyo). For the BA.2.12.1 subvariant, the IC 50 was lower by a factor of 0.3 with remdesivir, was higher by a factor of 1.1 with molnupiravir, and was lower by a factor of 0.7 with nirmatrelvir; for the BA.4 subvariant, the IC 50 was lower by a factor of 0.7 with remdesivir and was higher by factors of 1.2 and 1.1 with molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir, respectively; and for the BA.5 subvariant, the IC 50 was higher by factors of 1.2, 1.5, and 1.6 with remdesivir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. S4).\n\nThe main limitation of our study is the lack of clinical data on the efficacy of these monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs for the treatment of patients infected with BA.2.12.1, BA.4, or BA.5 subvariants. Overall, our data suggest that the three small-molecule antiviral drugs remdesivir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir may have therapeutic value against the sublineages BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5 of SARS-CoV-2 omicron variants. Our data also indicate that bebtelovimab is effective against BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5. However, in clinical use, these variants may be less susceptible to combination therapy with casirivimab and imdevimab and with tixagevimab and cilgavimab. In addition, sotrovimab may not provide effective treatment against BA.2.12.1, BA.4, or BA.5. Our findings show that the selection of monoclonal antibodies to treat patients who are infected with omicron variants should be carefully considered.\n\nEmi Takashita, Ph.D.\n\nNational Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan\n\nSeiya Yamayoshi, D.V.M., Ph.D.\n\nUniversity of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan\n\nViviana Simon, M.D., Ph.D.\n\nHarm van Bakel, Ph.D.\n\nEmilia M.

        "To assist leaders in government, academic, the private sector and others who depend on the physical sciences as they craft specific recommendations to address the COVID-19 pandemic's impacts, the American Institute of Physics convened a panel of experts to forecast the effects on the physical sciences.\n\nThe panel that produced this report is composed of nine experts who bring scientific, institutional, experiential, and other dimensions of diversity to this task. Over the course of six weeks, from May to June 2020, the panel focused on the actual and potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical sciences enterprise as a first step in envisioning a post-pandemic recovery strategy. This report discusses the pandemic's current and expected impacts on the physical sciences enterprise in three dimensions: workforce, infrastructure, and the conduct of research.\n\n\n\nDownload the full report\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nAs with much of America and the world, the conduct of the physical sciences\u2014physics, chemistry, Earth science, astronomy, and related fields\u2014has been severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The shutdown of most activities has stalled research, particularly in the laboratory and field sciences, which generally require in-person interactions and logistical support. The operation of major facilities and international travel have been largely curtailed, and universities are being challenged as never before. Perhaps the largest impact has been on students and early-career scientists, especially those from underrepresented groups. On the positive side, the pandemic has opened up opportunities to convene scientists in new ways, making use of new technologies that shrink distances and enable new forms of interpersonal interaction across miles. Social distancing and other pandemic countermeasures, such as virtual meetings, have illuminated the increasing interconnectedness of the sciences, the important roles played by each field of science, as well as the challenges and opportunities associated with new ways of connecting scientists.\n\nThe physical sciences have long contributed to the nation\u2019s prosperity and well-being through advancements in, and contributions to, fields from biotechnology to quantum science, from aerospace engineering to renewable energy, and from numerical weather prediction to emergency response. Yet as we survey the pandemic\u2019s impacts, the American physical sciences may be at a tipping point.\n\nIf we take swift action to define and defend a vibrant future for science in the United States as we rebuild and renew after the pandemic, we can bring new strength, resiliency, and diversity to the physical sciences community to the benefit of our economy and society for decades. If we do not act on this promise of new opportunity, we are in peril of losing the resilient and robust physical sciences enterprise America needs to remain healthy, innovative, and prosperous.\n\nThe physical scientists and engineers that are helping the nation begin to recover stand ready to contribute further. We can emerge from the crisis stronger than ever before, but we need to recognize the more critical impacts and act now.\n\nPandemic's Impact on the Physical Sciences Enterprise Panel Members\n\nChair\n\nJulia Phillips, Sandia National Laboratories (Retired)\n\nMembers\n\nSusan Avery, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (Retired)\n\nJonathan Bagger, TRIUMF\n\nPhil Bucksbaum, Stanford University\n\nFrance C\u00f3rdova, National Science Foundation (Retired)\n\nEric Isaacs, Carnegie Institution\n\nVictor McCrary, University of the District of Columbia\n\nRobie Samanta Roy, Lockheed Martin Corporation\n\nCarl Wieman, Stanford University\n\nAIP Staff Liaisons\n\nMichael H.

        "P\n\nresident Biden\u2019s bout with COVID-19 is illustrative of the debate currently raging about \u201cPaxlovid rebound\u201d \u2014 the recurrence of symptoms and of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 after a seemingly successful five-day treatment course of Paxlovid. This phenomenon is not unusual, and it suggests that regulators should modify the terms of the drug\u2019s Emergency Use Authorization.\n\nWhen he headed the Food & Drug Administration, Dr. Frank Young used to admonish his minions that sometimes regulations need to be tempered with common sense. Regulators would do well to apply that advice as the agency ponders whether additional steps are necessary to guide Paxlovid users.\n\nPaxlovid is a true breakthrough drug with efficacy of over 90% in treating mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and preventing hospitalization and death. It is an oral two-drug combination regimen \u2014 one drug is nirmatrelvir, an antiviral, while the second, ritonavir, inhibits the metabolism of the nirmatrelvir, thereby maintaining therapeutic levels.\n\nBut as with the president and a small number of other cases, physicians sometimes see an unexpected phenomenon \u2014 an improvement of symptoms, only to have them (and test positivity) return within days after completion of the five-day course. It\u2019s known as the Paxlovid Rebound.\n\nThere are not much data on how frequently this occurs, but a recent article in Clinical Infectious Diseases reported an incidence of 0.8%. Whatever the frequency, there are several possible mechanisms to explain such a phenomenon. The likeliest is that the Paxlovid dose is too low or the length of treatment too short to prevent the rebound, because the drug knocks down the amount of virus present so rapidly that the immune system doesn\u2019t have sufficient time to eradicate it, and the virus begins to replicate again.\n\nFollow the latest news and policy debates on agricultural biotech and biomedicine? Subscribe to our newsletter. SIGN UP\n\nA pertinent question, then, is how long does it take for the immune system to clear SARS-CoV-2 from an infected patient? Ironically, the best answer to this question comes from the TOGETHER randomized controlled trial that examined the effect of ivermectin vs. placebo on multiple parameters of COVID-19, one of which was the number of days it took to clear the virus. (TOGETHER is a private-sector funded international collaboration to identify existing medications that can be re-purposed to prevent or treat COVID-19)\n\nIn the trial, only a quarter of the trial participants were able to clear the virus within seven days with no treatment, so that the time to achieve complete viral clearance for most patients must be considerably longer, perhaps two or three weeks, maybe more. How long, then, does it take for patients treated with Paxlovid to clear the virus?\n\nAlthough this precise information is not available from Pfizer\u2019s clinical trials (which were performed pre-Omicron), the company does provide this information:\n\nAn approximate 10-fold decrease in viral load at Day 5, relative to placebo, was observed in both EPIC-HR and EPIC-SR [trials], indicating robust activity against SARS-CoV-2 and representing the strongest viral load reduction reported to date for a COVID-19 oral antiviral agent.\n\nThis offers a solid clue about what\u2019s happening. While a five-day course of Paxlovid is sufficient to keep about 90% of Covid victims out of the hospital and reduce their viral load 10-fold, there appears to be a subpopulation of people who either didn\u2019t respond as well as others to Paxlovid or, perhaps, had a higher viral load to begin with.\n\nThat is consistent with the findings of researchers at the University of California, San Diego, who concluded that Paxlovid rebound occurs when infected cells get insufficient exposure to the drug to stop all viral replication, either because the medication was being metabolized too quickly in some patients or that the drug needs to be given for a longer duration.\n\nWhite House Covid advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci appears to have experienced one of those phenomena, leading to a rebound of his Covid-19 infection after taking Paxlovid.\n\nAfter five days on the drug, he tested negative, then had three consecutive days of negative tests, but on the fourth day tested positive again. Fauci said his symptoms were worse when they returned after treatment, so \u2014 and here\u2019s the interesting part \u2014 his doctors prescribed another course of Paxlovid, and his symptoms improved.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Paxlovid, in the Agency\u2019s April 2022 letter to Pfizer, the drug\u2019s manufacturer, contains this statement:\n\nPAXLOVID is not authorized for use for longer than 5 consecutive days\n\nThus, strictly speaking, that second course was impermissible under the EUA\u2026 which gets us back to FDA Commissioner Frank Young\u2019s admonition about regulators\u2019 using common sense.\n\nEven in the absence of definitive data, which would be time-consuming and expensive to accumulate at this point, it would be sensible for the FDA to extend the authorized course of Paxlovid treatment to, say, eight or ten days. It could spare Paxlovid recipients the rebound of Covid symptoms and additional virus-caused damage.\n\nGood medicine, like good regulation, sometimes requires common sense in addition to hard data.\n\nDr. Henry I.

        "T\n\nhe previous pandemics to which people often compare COVID-19 \u2013 the influenza pandemic of 1918 , the Black Death bubonic plague (1342-1353), the Justinian plague (541-542) \u2013 don\u2019t seem that long ago to archaeologists. We\u2019re used to thinking about people who lived many centuries or even millennia ago. Evidence found directly on skeletons shows that infectious diseases have been with us since our beginnings as a species.\n\nBioarchaeologists like us analyze skeletons to reveal more about how infectious diseases originated and spread in ancient times.\n\nHow did aspects of early people\u2019s social behavior allow diseases to flourish? How did people try to care for the sick? How did individuals and entire societies modify behaviors to protect themselves and others?\n\nKnowing these things might help scientists understand why COVID-19 has wreaked such global devastation and what needs to be put in place before the next pandemic.\n\nClues about illnesses long ago\n\nHow can bioarchaeologists possibly know these things, especially for early cultures that left no written record? Even in literate societies, poorer and marginalized segments were rarely written about.\n\nIn most archaeological settings, all that remains of our ancestors is the skeleton.\n\nFor some infectious diseases, like syphilis, tuberculosis and leprosy, the location, characteristics and distribution of marks on a skeleton\u2019s bones can serve as distinctive \u201cpathognomonic\u201d indicators of the infection.\n\nMost skeletal signs of disease are non-specific, though, meaning bioarchaeologists today can tell an individual was sick, but not with what disease. Some diseases never affect the skeleton at all, including plague and viral infections like HIV and COVID-19. And diseases that kill quickly don\u2019t have enough time to leave a mark on victims\u2019 bones.\n\nTo uncover evidence of specific diseases beyond obvious bone changes, bioarchaeologists use a variety of methods, often with the help of other specialists, like geneticists or parasitologists. For instance, analyzing soil collected in a grave from around a person\u2019s pelvis can reveal the remains of intestinal parasites, such as tapeworms and round worms. Genetic analyses can also identify the DNA of infectious pathogens still clinging to ancient bones and teeth.\n\nBioarchaeologists can also estimate age at death based on how developed a youngster\u2019s teeth and bones are, or how much an adult\u2019s skeleton has degenerated over its lifespan. Then demographers help us draw age profiles for populations that died in epidemics. Most infectious diseases disproportionately affect those with the weakest immune systems, usually the very young and very old.\n\nFor instance, the Black Death was indiscriminate; 14th-century burial pits contain the typical age distributions found in cemeteries we know were not for Black Death victims. In contrast, the 1918 flu pandemic was unusual in that it hit hardest those with the most robust immune systems, that is, healthy young adults. COVID-19 today is also leaving a recognizable profile of those most likely to die from the disease, targeting older and vulnerable people and particular ethnic groups.\n\nWe can find out what infections were around in the past through our ancestors\u2019 remains, but what does this tell us about the bigger picture of the origin and evolution of infections? Archaeological clues can help researchers reconstruct aspects of socioeconomic organization, environment and technology. And we can study how variations in these risk factors caused diseases to vary across time, in different areas of the world and even among people living in the same societies.\n\nFollow the latest news and policy debates on agricultural biotech and biomedicine?

Culture influences biology, too, although it can be hard for our bodies to keep up with rapid cultural changes. For example, in the 20th century, highly processed fast food replaced a more balanced and healthy diet for many. Because the human body evolved and was designed for a different world, this dietary switch resulted in a rise in diseases like diabetes, heart disease and obesity.\n\nFrom a paleoepidemiological perspective, the most significant event in our species\u2019 history was the adoption of farming. Agriculture arose independently in several places around the world beginning around 12,000 years ago.\n\nPrior to this change, people lived as hunter-gatherers, with dogs as their only animal companions. They were very active and had a well balanced, varied diet that was high in protein and fiber and low in calories and fat. These small groups experienced parasites, bacterial infections and injuries while hunting wild animals and occasionally fighting with one another. They also had to deal with dental problems, including extreme wear, plaque and periodontal disease.\n\nOne thing hunter-gatherers didn\u2019t need to worry much about, however, was virulent infectious diseases that could move quickly from person to person throughout a large geographic region. Pathogens like the influenza virus were not able to effectively spread or even be maintained by small, mobile, and socially isolated populations.\n\nThe advent of agriculture resulted in larger, sedentary populations of people living in close proximity. New diseases could flourish in this new environment. The transition to agriculture was characterized by high childhood mortality, in which approximately 30% or more of children died before the age of 5.\n\nAnd for the first time in an evolutionary history spanning millions of years, different species of mammals and birds became intimate neighbors. Once people began to live with newly domesticated animals, they were brought into the life cycle of a new group of diseases \u2013 called zoonoses \u2013 that previously had been limited to wild animals but could now jump into human beings.\n\nAdd to all this the stresses of poor sanitation and a deficient diet, as well as increased connections between distant communities through migration and trade especially between urban communities, and epidemics of infectious disease were able to take hold for the first time.\n\nGlobalization of disease\n\nLater events in human history also resulted in major epidemiological transitions related to disease.\n\nFor more than 10,000 years, the people of Europe, the Middle East and Asia evolved along with particular zoonoses in their local environments. The animals people were in contact with varied from place to place. As people lived alongside particular animal species over long periods of time, a symbiosis could develop \u2013 as well as immune resistance to local zoonoses.\n\nAt the beginning of modern history, people from European empires also began traveling across the globe, taking with them a suite of \u201cOld World\u201d diseases that were devastating for groups who hadn\u2019t evolved alongside them. Indigenous populations in Australia, the Pacific and the Americas had no biological familiarity with these new pathogens. Without immunity, one epidemic after another ravaged these groups. Mortality estimates range between 60-90%.\n\nThe study of disease in skeletons, mummies and other remains of past people has played a critical role in reconstructing the origin and evolution of pandemics, but this work also provides evidence of compassion and care, including medical interventions such as trepanation, dentistry, amputation and prostheses, herbal remedies and surgical instruments.\n\nOther evidence shows that people have often done their best to protect others, as well as themselves, from disease. Perhaps one of the most famous examples is the English village of Eyam, which made a self-sacrificing decision to isolate itself to prevent further spread of a plague from London in 1665.\n\nIn other eras, people with tuberculosis were placed in sanatoria, people with leprosy were admitted to specialized hospitals or segregated on islands or into remote areas, and urban dwellers fled cities when plagues came.\n\nAs the world faces yet another pandemic, the archaeological and historical record are reminders that people have lived with infectious disease for millennia. Pathogens have helped shape civilization, and humans have been resilient in the face of such crises.\n\nCharlotte Roberts is a Professor of Archeology at Durham University.\n\nGabriel D.

        "\u201cCould THIS twice-daily probiotic supplement filled with gut friendly bacteria help beat Long Covid?\u201d That\u2019s the headline in the Daily Mail earlier this year, one of dozens in the media across the web promoting the miracle of probiotics.\n\nDozens of other news outlets, from Psychology Today to Medical News Today carried the same unfiltered story. Taking a probiotic supplement, they report, could improve COVID recoveries by promoting the \u201cright mix of gut bacteria\u201d to \u201cboost the body\u2019s immune defenses\u201d.\n\nThese are not new claims. Since the COVID crisis commenced more than two years, and based on a few sketchy and inconclusive studies, \u2018natural\u2019 websites have been making claims that probiotic supplements could be the magic bullet to halt or even cure COVID. According to NUTRA Ingredients, which peddles supplements \u201ca probiotic formulation could act as a complementary remedy to slow down the progression of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nIs it too good to be true?\n\nThe answer is \u2018yes\u2019 but with nuance.\n\nThe most recent surge in articles was sparked by a small study out of Bhatia Hospital, Mumbai that suggested \u2018Long Covid\u2019 may be dictated by the microbes in our gut and that probiotics could hold a solution. \u201cThe gut microbiome is involved in the magnitude of COVID severity \u2014 possibly via modulating host immune responses,\u201d they claimed.\n\nThis represents another in a line of studies that seem to support the idea that rebalancing the bacteria in our gut may help fight long-term COVID symptoms. In December, for example, researchers at Cambridge University Hospitals (CUH) NHS Foundation Trust presented data claiming to demonstrate that \u201ctwo capsules a day containing a scientifically chosen blend of natural ingredients could help patients suffering from long COVID\u201d.\n\nOncology consultant Prof Robert Thomas was quoted as saying, \u201cSuch a rapid improvement in the majority who had been experiencing symptoms for over eight months was clinically relevant and welcomed, especially among those more likely to have pre-existing gut dysbiosis.\u201d\n\nBut most scientists and researchers are more dubious. Certainly, there is no question that our gut bacteria is linked to our health. Whether tinkering with our gut bacteria using supplements can meaningfully help address COVID, or any disease for that matter, is far more problematic.\n\nFollow the latest news and policy debates on agricultural biotech and biomedicine? Subscribe to our newsletter. SIGN UP\n\nSkepticism\n\nSince COVID first appeared two years, probiotic devotees have been promoting salves and supplements, claiming that they could boost your immunity and ward off the coronavirus. But the curative claims of probiotics has been met with raised eyebrows from the medical and scientific world.\n\nThere is widespread evidence that gut bacteria is linked to our health\u2014it\u2019s just that probiotics have not been shown to improve it as an aid to battling COVID.\n\nThe National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine have responded to the COVID claims with skepticism: \u201cThere is currently no evidence that taking probiotics can prevent or treat COVID-19\u201d. They encourage consumers to \u201cbeware of false claims about COVID-19 cures\u201d.\n\nAkiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University, was an early voice of caution, challenging probiotics as a COVID-fighting tool. As he told the BBC, the idea that pills, trendy superfoods or wellness habits can provide a shortcut to a healthy immune system is a myth. In fact, the concept of \u201cboosting\u201d your immune system doesn\u2019t hold any scientific meaning whatsoever.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that many of these claims have no grounding in evidence\u201d. This idea was viewed as a case of \u201cpseudoscientists are peddling trendy products such as kombucha and probiotics\u201d.\n\nIn other words, this idea may be too good to be true for a reason. Such claims during health crises have a long history. During the Spanish flu crisis a century ago, Vick\u2019s VapoRub offered itself as special treatment along with taking laxatives. Crises breed opportunity, and sometimes snake oil salesman. Is that what\u2019s going on here?\n\nDubious claims\n\nCertainly, many of the sites promoting probiotics do their best to make it seem their over-the counter and unregulated probiotic products are medical magic. Take one example claiming to present a \u201cNew breakthrough study in overweight adults on a weight loss program\u201d. It is clear to any objective eye that this is an advertisement with the product taking front and center and minimal information about the alleged supporting study:\n\nOther ads are a little more subtle. Headlines like \u201cShelf-stable or refrigerated: Which probiotic is better for you?\u201d or \u201c5 surprising signs you probably need a probiotic\u201d are designed to convince the reader into thinking there is scientifically useful information to back up the claims.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what you find when you \u201cGo to the breakthrough study results\u201d. Instead, you are transported via hyperlinks to supplements and products along with disclaimers stating, \u201cAny products featured in this article are selected by our editors, who don\u2019t play favorites. If you buy something, we may get a cut of the sale.\u201d\n\nMany promotional websites contain information that is not only scientifically tenuous, but contrary to the latest data. One common example: articles promoting the use of probiotics to counter gut bacteria loss after a course of antibiotics. This is a popular sales pitch but, unfortunately, data such as this study from the Weismann Institute in Israel suggests this is not such a good idea. Immunologist Dr. Eran Elinav explains:\n\nThe evidence for taking probiotics after antibiotics is a little murky and contradictory, but the public perception of many people and some doctors is that this is a good idea, even without substantial medical evidence. Contrary to the current dogma that probiotics are harmless and benefit everyone, these results reveal a new potential adverse side effect of probiotic use with antibiotics that might even bring long-term consequences. We need to be cautious about recommending this until further knowledge emerges.\n\nTo date, no probiotic has been FDA approved for clinical use, yet supplements flood the market as they remain unregulated in the US and many other countries.. \u201cMarketing of product is often geared directly at consumers without providing direct and consistent proof of effectiveness,\u201d notes the American Gastroenterological Association.\n\nSo how did this latest probiotic craze gain traction?\n\nLet\u2019s review the science.\n\nThe concept of utilizing probiotics as \u201cCOVID cures\u201d appears to have emerged from multiple studies that suggested the cause may lie within our digestive tract. More specifically, the ~100 trillion bacteria and microorganisms within our gut microbiome. They are a key part of our digestive system. Whenever we eat something, it needs to be broken down so that the nutrients can be absorbed and processed by our body. We cannot do this alone. We require assistance from our gut microbes, particularly in the case of complex carbohydrates and fibers. The bacteria in our gut breakdown and ferment these components and release products that can be utilized by our body.\n\nThe gut microbiome has been linked to many chronic illnesses in the past but the actual impact it has is often debated and data can be tenuous at best. Now, a new set of claims that \u201ctaking a capsule of probiotics, which are designed to boost the number of beneficial bacteria in the gut, may speed up recovery from the coronavirus\u201d are gaining traction.\n\nThis is further fueled by an initial study from The Chinese University of Hong Kong that reported an increased presence of harmful and pathogenic bacteria in COVID patients with severe/long-term illness. When paired with the depletion of immune-boosting gut bacteria, the reports suggest that the gut microbial changes could directly relate to an increased risk of developing long-COVID. This has led to some concluding that probiotic supplements could be a way to protect against or treat long term complications of COVID-19 by rebalancing such changes in our gut microbes. Prof Siew NG, head of the study, concluded:\n\nThe most surprising findings were that different bacteria patterns were associated with different categories of Long Covid symptoms such as respiratory, neurological, gastrointestinal, hair loss, etc. Such patterns were characterized by a higher level of \u201cunfriendly\u201d microbes and lower levels of \u201cfriendly\u201d microbes.\n\nIt sounds promising but suggestive news based on incomplete research should always be approached with a considerable caution. First, COVID pathology is complex. It involves a cascade of immune events that can trigger serious consequences in a number of areas of the body. In the words of John Wherry, director of the Penn Medicine Immune Health Institute, \u201cCOVID is deranging the immune system\u201d.\n\nSecond, and more importantly, we should be wary of studies that play into the billion-dollar probiotic industry narrative that untested products hold the \u2018silver bullet\u2019 for complex healthcare issue.\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic online, \u201cthere is no clear evidence that probiotics are beneficial,\u201d let alone a potential silver bullet to treat COVID.\n\nFor the most part, probiotic supplements have no measurable impact on your gut microbiome diversity and may actually cause harm in some instances. Dr Matthew Ciorba, a gastroenterologist at Washington University in St. Louis, echoes this message, saying, \u201cThere is no evidence to suggest that people with normal gastrointestinal tracts can benefit from taking probiotics.\u201d\n\nMany supplement suppliers claim their products \u201coptimize your gut.\u201d That\u2019s mumbo jumbo. The average probiotic supplement contains ~2 billion bacteria. That sounds like a lot but when you consider those 2 billion will only account for 0.002% of the 100 trillion microorganisms in your gut, it\u2019s a bit like dropping a salt particle into a gallon of maple syrup and expecting it to taste salty. The impact will be minimal to non-existent in all but a few specific cases of digestive issues.\n\n\u201cEveryone else can save their money, because there\u2019s no evidence that probiotic supplements offer any benefit to already healthy people,\u201d says Prof Jack Gilbert, founder of the American Gut Project.\n\nBeyond the hype\n\nSo why does the hype around a probiotic COVID cure persist? Greed and bad reporting, for the most part.\n\nIt is often generated by cherry picking of data by websites seeking to promote sales of supplements. Many of the probiotic websites are trying to leverage fear generated by COVID to make a sales pitch for other probiotic supplements.\n\nOnce you get past the \u2018miracle COVID cure\u2019 headlines, many articles actually report more sober and less encouraging findings. One article claiming probiotics can treat COVID, for example, included a quote from a researcher in the field: \u201cIt is not that the use of one probiotic will reduce all the problems caused by COVID-19\u201d, with the article going on to state that \u201cthe best case for probiotic therapy has been in the treatment of diarrhea\u201d. Hardly the COVID are touted in the headline!\n\nThe Daily Mail led with the claim that \u201cnow it seems our gut bacteria can also tackle COVID-19\u201d. However, further into the article, the authors of the study are quoted as being much more measured. Professor Andrew Smith (Medical Sciences) offered this measured take on his findings along with a warming about taking probiotics:\n\nThe study excluded those over 60 and did not account for whether volunteers had been vaccinated or not. So, we don\u2019t know if probiotics provide any benefit to those most at risk of severe Covid. And taking probiotics may be inappropriate for those with a weakened immune system because of the potential increased risk of infection from consuming large quantities of live bacteria.\n\nBut probiotics are at least harmless, right?\n\nIf I want to take it as a precaution surely there is no downside to trying it?\n\nUnfortunately, that may not be the case. According to research from\n\nEran Elinav of the Weizmann Institute of Science, taking probiotics in certain scenarios can actually cause harm:\n\nThe probiotics very potently and persistently prevented the original microbiome returning to its original situation. \u2026 This was very surprising and alarming to us. This adverse effect has not been described to date.\n\nSo there is a risk, however minimal, in taking probiotic supplements in the hope of avoiding complications of COVID-19. When you pair that with the lack of tangible evidence of its benefits, there is not much of a case for probiotics as preventative or acute therapy.\n\nIt is very difficult to find any reputable medical professional promoting probiotics as COVID treatments. For the most part, the idea is being pushed forward by supplement pushers, diet promoters or people that will sell you a handy and expensive course to help you \u201coptimize your microbiome\u201d.\n\nProceed with caution when articles claim you can cure disease by changing the bacteria in your gut. Especially when they claim you can start healing yourself with a convenient, over the counter probiotic pill\u2014one that your doctor would never prescribe. It\u2019s a snake oil salesman pushing miracle cures.\n\nSam Moxon has a PhD in tissue engineering and is currently a research fellow in the field of regenerative medicine.

        "Experts share tips for improving mental health as we emerge and heal from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has become a big part of our daily lives. Between news reports on it, its economic costs, and the regular updates on local cases, it can feel impossible to escape COVID-19\u2019s effects. Feelings of increased anxiety, uneasiness, and fear are far from uncommon \u2014 even when people seem to be thriving at home as they pick up new hobbies or read through their entire home libraries. If you\u2019re still feeling like it\u2019s difficult to move through your day, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nHow has the pandemic affected our mental health? We\u2019re just starting to truly understand the mental health effects of the past year. \u201cEveryone is experiencing this pandemic and quarantine differently,\u201d explains Dr. Jessica Myszak, a child psychologist. \u201cAn apt description I\u2019ve heard is that we are all in the same storm, but we are in different types of boats.\u201d The mental health impact on adults What we do know is that living through a pandemic has removed many foundations we used to rely on, like a stable income, a social support system, and food security. That\u2019s why 2 in 5 U.S. adults reported difficulties with mental health issues and substance use in June 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) . Nearly 1 in 3 reported symptoms of anxiety or depression. Mental health professionals have also seen an increase in the number of people seeking professional help and therapy. Even as the pandemic passes its 1-year anniversary, approximately 1 in 5 U.S. adults still experience high levels of distress. Many people who were required to report to their workplace in person faced daily stress and fears of contracting the coronavirus in addition to financial insecurity. A poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation in April 2020 found 34% of adults in the United States were classified as \u201cessential.\u201d Among them: Almost 1 in 3 said they would have to put an unexpected $500 medical bill on a credit card or borrow money.\n\nAlmost 1 in 5 said they wouldn\u2019t be able to pay it. This type of financial insecurity can add up to an often draining work environment for people who didn\u2019t have the option to work from home. Parents whose kids were (or are) learning remotely \u2014 or were home due to trouble finding day care \u2014 may have also grappled with additional concerns. \u201cThe pandemic has had a major impact on parents, particularly parents of younger children,\u201d explains Christopher Beevers, professor and director of the Institute for Mental Health Research at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cIn many cases, the parents have had to take on multiple roles \u2014 caregiver, teacher, parent \u2014 with few opportunities to take a break,\u201d he says. \u201cSimultaneously, many parents are also supposed to be working from home with their own set of deadlines and work responsibilities. This sort of multitasking is highly stressful and puts a huge burden on the family unit,\u201d Beevers says. If you\u2019re still not sure how the pandemic has affected your mental health, you can use this checklist to get some clarity. The mental health impact on children and teens It isn\u2019t just adults who have experienced mental health effects. Children\u2019s mental health may have been affected by disruptions to their schoolwork, learning, and social lives. An estimated 1.6 billion learners worldwide have been affected by school closures. This left many feeling isolated and disoriented by the lack of school routine and the difficulties that come with remote learning. \u201cFor many students, online school has been an extreme challenge due to difficulty focusing and staying on task while attending school from home,\u201d explains Kristel Roper, LMFT, LPCC. \u201cStudents with ADHD or other conditions that can make learning difficult have been even more negatively affected by the recent changes.\u201d Because of the school closures, some children with extra developmental needs have been less likely to be noticed and have their needs addressed by their teachers. Myszak explains, \u201cChildren who would be identified in school as needing additional support may not be coming to the attention of the school, so they are not getting the services they need.\u201d There\u2019s also been an increase in reported thoughts of suicide and self-harm among young adults. A recent report from Mental Health America showed an increase in these thoughts, especially among LGBTQIA+ youth. Suicide prevention If you or someone you know is considering suicide, you\u2019re not alone. Help is available right now: You can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 24 hours a day at 800-273-8255.\n\nContact the teen-to-teen peer hotline Teen Line at 800-852-8336 or text TEEN to 839863. Not in the United States? You can find a helpline in your country with Befrienders Worldwide.\n\nHow has the pandemic affected people who already have a mental health condition? If you have an existing mental health condition, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have made some symptoms worse. \u201cIndividuals with anxiety often benefit from increased structure, positive social interactions, and spending time engaging in valued activities,\u201d Roper explains. \u201cAll of these have been made much more difficult by the quarantine.\u201d In addition, physical distancing measures have made it more difficult for some people to find help when dealing with loss or substance use, as many mental health professionals and support groups moved online. According to the CDC, there was an 18.2% increase in overdose-related deaths that accelerated around the time stay-at-home orders were put in place. \u201cSome have referred to the pandemic as an \u2018accelerant\u2019 that has exposed or exacerbated many vulnerabilities in society,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cPeople who have experienced depression in the past or had mild symptoms leading into the pandemic were very likely at high risk for experiencing depression during the pandemic,\u201d he says.\n\nTips to support your mental health through the pandemic Even as we continue to move forward, many people will be reeling and healing from the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. While time may be part of the healing equation, there\u2019s a lot you can do now to take care of your mental health. And the rise of online therapy options has made professional mental healthcare more accessible for many people. Here are a few ways to care for your mental health during the pandemic and beyond. Create a daily routine Our daily work commute and office routine were some of the first things to change with the pandemic. If you once had a strict train, mealtime, or day care pickup schedule, staying at home was a real shake-up to your daily routine. That\u2019s why it can help to create a personal daily routine. \u201cI would highly recommend creating your own structure through a routine that you follow each day,\u201d Roper says. For example, it can be helpful to wake up and eat meals at the same time. Focus on reducing stress Making time to take care of yourself can help you better handle the stressors in your life. Like a car trying to run without gas, your capacity to deal with stress may be limited if your physical and mental health are running on empty. \u201cI always recommend starting [with] the basics: eating well and exercising,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cEven just a 15- to 30-minute walk each day can help ease stress and anxiety.\u201d And if you enjoy meditation, yoga, or listening to calming music and sounds, you might schedule time to engage in these activities. Set boundaries between work and home life When you were still working in the office or on location for your job, the act of physically clocking out and heading home was a natural way to transition out of your workday. But when you\u2019re working from home, it can be tough to leave the workday behind. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a good idea to set boundaries between work time and home time. For example, you could \u201ccommute\u201d to another room in your house to work, and leave that room (and work computer) behind when you end your day. If you have a home-based job with nonspecific hours, consider setting a regular work schedule to help prevent tasks from carrying over into your personal time. This can be especially true for parents working at home with their children. \u201cBeing able to turn off the computer, silence the phone, and engage in play and fun activities will speak volumes to children seeking attention,\u201d Myszak says. \u201cShowing children you are willing to spend time with them will be much more effective than anything you would say to them.\u201d Talk with a mental health professional Many resources are available to help you manage mental health challenges during the pandemic. Online therapy is becoming more popular, and it\u2019s proving effective for people during the COVID-19 pandemic. If you\u2019re interested in finding mental health support online, here are some free online therapy and support services and 10 free mental health apps to get started. Some local and national support groups can also help free of cost. While these alternatives may not be as personalized as one-on-one therapy, it can help to talk with a community of people who\u2019ve had similar experiences. These groups may also help if you\u2019re dealing with loneliness or isolation, because they allow you to interact and talk with people digitally. Mental Health America has also created an extensive list of support groups that can help you find support if you\u2019re dealing with mental health symptoms, domestic violence, or addiction. Be kind to yourself This idea gets repeated so often that it can be hard to remember what it truly means. Practicing kindness toward yourself can mean treating yourself like you\u2019d treat a loved one when you\u2019re feeling not so great. \u201cWe can be our own worst critics,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cA little self-compassion can go a long way towards feeling better. We are all doing the best that we can under incredibly difficult circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccine\u2019s role in mental health Many people are feeling relief after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. For them, it has helped lower anxiety about contracting the virus, being hospitalized, or dying as a result of the disease. Still, many people have been skeptical of the vaccine\u2019s accelerated rollout and possible side effects. This remains a real concern among some people in the United States. \u201cFor those who are wary of the vaccine, I always recommend doing your research,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cOne of the best things you can do is ask your own trusted healthcare team. They\u2019ll be able to share their professional opinions with your specific needs in mind.\u201d You can also talk with friends and family about their experiences during the pandemic and with the vaccine. Since so much of the pandemic was marked by distancing our relationships, there\u2019s great potential for healing as we start to slowly and safely reunite. \u201cFor many, the vaccine rollout has brought with it a collective sigh of relief,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cIt has also likely been highly emotional for many as we begin to see our loved ones, friends, neighbors, and communities get the vaccine and feel, for the first time in a while, that feeling of hope.\u201d",
        "Despite claims of anti-vaccine activists no different than groups that used to claim vaccines cause autism, COVID-19 vaccines do not impact fecundability\u2014the probability of conception per menstrual cycle\u2014in female or male partners who received the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson vaccines.\n\nThe prospective study instead indicates that COVID-19 infection among males may temporarily reduce fertility\u2014 an outcome that could be avoidable through vaccination.\n\nLead author Dr. Amelia Wesselink, epidemiologist at Boston University School of Public Health, and colleagues analyzed survey data on COVID-19 vaccination and infection, and fecundability, among female and male participants in the BUSPH-based Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO), an ongoing NIH-funded study that enrolls women trying to conceive, and follows them from preconception through six months after delivery. Participants included 2,126 women in the US and Canada who provided information on sociodemographics, lifestyle, medical factors, and characteristics of their partners from December 2020 to September 2021, and the participants were followed in the study through November 2021.\n\nThe researchers calculated the per menstrual cycle probability of conception using self-reported dates of participants\u2019 last menstrual period, typical menstrual cycle length, and pregnancy status. Fertility rates among female participants who received at least one dose of a vaccine were nearly identical to unvaccinated female participants. Fecundability was also similar for male partners who had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine compared with unvaccinated male participants. Additional analyses that considered the number of vaccine doses, brand of vaccine, infertility history, occupation, and geographic region also indicated no effect of vaccination on fertility.\n\nWhile COVID-19 infection was not strongly associated with fertility, men who tested positive for COVID within 60 days of a given cycle had reduced fertility compared to men who never tested positive, or men who tested positive at least 60 days prior. This data supports previous research that has linked COVID-19 infection in men with poor sperm quality and other reproductive dysfunction.\n\n\u201cThese data provide reassuring evidence that COVID vaccination in either partner does not affect fertility among couples trying to conceive,\u201d says study senior author Dr. Lauren Wise, professor of epidemiology at BUSPH. \u201cThe prospective study design, large sample size, and geographically heterogeneous study population are study strengths, as was our control for many variables such as age, socioeconomic status, preexisting health conditions, occupation, and stress levels.\u201d\n\nThe new data also help quell concerns about COVID-19 vaccines and fertility that arose from anecdotal reports of females experiencing menstrual cycle changes following vaccination.",
        "A new trial has begun in Victoria this week to evaluate a potential vaccine against COVID-19.\n\nThe vaccine is called NVX-CoV2373 and is from a US biotech company, Novavax.\n\nThe trial will be carried out across Melbourne and Brisbane, and is the first human trial of a vaccine specifically for COVID-19 to take place in Australia.\n\nThis vaccine is actually based on a vaccine that was already in development for influenza. But how might it work against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19?\n\nWhat\u2019s in the mix?\n\nVaccines trigger an immune response by introducing the cells of our immune system to a virus in a safe way, without any exposure to the pathogen itself.\n\nAll vaccines have to do two things. The first is make our immune cells bind to and \u201ceat up\u201d the vaccine. The second is to activate these immune cells so they\u2019re prepared to fight the current and any subsequent threats from the virus in question.\n\nWe often add molecules called adjuvants to vaccines to deliver a danger signal to the immune system, activate immune cells and trigger a strong immune response.\n\nThe Novavax vaccine is what we call a \u201csubunit\u201d vaccine because, instead of delivering the whole virus, it delivers only part of it. The element of SARS-CoV-2 in this vaccine is the spike protein, which is found on the surface of the virus.\n\nBy targeting a particular protein, a subunit vaccine is a great way to focus the immune response.\n\nHowever, protein by itself is not very good at binding to and activating the cells of our immune system. Proteins are generally soluble, which doesn\u2019t appeal to immune cells. They like something they can chew on.\n\nSo instead of soluble protein, Novavax has assembled the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein into very small particles, called nanoparticles. To immune cells, these nanoparticles look like little viruses, so immune cells can bind to these pre-packaged chunks of protein, rapidly engulfing them and becoming activated.\n\nThe Novavax vaccine also contains an adjuvant called Matrix-M. While the nanoparticles deliver a modest danger signal, Matrix-M can be added to deliver a much stronger danger signal and really wake up the immune system.\n\nThe spike protein is formed into nanoparticles to attract immune cells, and Matrix-M is added as an adjuvant to further activate immune cells. Author provided\n\nRethinking an influenza vaccine\n\nThe Novavax vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is based on a vaccine the company was already developing for influenza, called NanoFlu.\n\nThe NanoFlu vaccine contains similar parts \u2013 nanoparticles with the Matrix-M adjuvant. But it uses a different protein in the nanoparticle (hemagglutinin, which is on the outside of the influenza virus).\n\nIn October last year, Novavax started testing NanoFlu in a phase III clinical trial, the last level of clinical testing before a vaccine can be licensed. This trial had 2,650 volunteers and researchers were comparing whether NanoFlu performed as well as Fluzone, a standard influenza vaccine.\n\nAn important feature of this trial is participants were over the age of 65. Older people tend to have poorer responses to vaccines, because immune cells become more difficult to activate as we age.\n\nThis trial is ongoing, with volunteers to be followed until the end of the year. However, early results suggest NanoFlu can generate significantly higher levels of antibodies than Fluzone \u2013 even given the older people in the trial.\n\nAntibodies are small proteins made by our immune cells which bind strongly to viruses and can stop them from infecting cells in the nose and lungs. So increased antibodies with NanoFlu should result in lower rates of infection with influenza.\n\nThese results were similar to those released after the phase I trial of NanoFlu, and suggest NanoFlu would be the superior vaccine for influenza.\n\nSo the big question is \u2013 will the same strategy work for SARS-CoV-2?\n\nThe Novavax vaccine is one of several potential COVID-19 vaccines being trialed around the world. Shutterstock\n\nThe Australian clinical trial\n\nThe new phase I/II trial will enrol around 131 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 59 to assess the vaccine\u2019s safety and measure how it affects the body\u2019s immune response.\n\nSome volunteers will not receive the vaccine, as a placebo control. The rest will receive the vaccine, in a few different forms.\n\nThe trial will test two doses of protein nanoparticles \u2013 a low (5 microgram) or a high (25 microgram) dose. Both doses will be delivered with Matrix-M adjuvant but the higher dose will also be tested without Matrix-M.\n\nAll groups will receive two shots of the vaccine 21 days apart, except one group that will just get one shot.\n\nThis design enables researchers to ask four important questions:\n\ncan the vaccine induce an immune response? if so, what dose of nanoparticle is best? do you need adjuvant or are nanoparticles enough? do you need two shots or is one enough?\n\nWhile it\u2019s not yet clear how the vaccine will perform for SARS-CoV-2, Novavax has reported it generated strong immune responses in animals.\n\nAnd we know NanoFlu performed well and had a good safety profile for influenza. NanoFlu also seemed to work well in older adults, which would be essential for a vaccine for COVID-19.\n\nWe eagerly await the first set of results, expected in a couple of months \u2013 an impressive turnaround time for a clinical trial. If this initial study is successful, the phase II portion of the trial will begin, with more participants.\n\nThe Novavax vaccine joins at least nine other vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2 currently in clinical testing around the world.\n\nBy Kylie Quinn, Vice-Chancellor's Research Fellow, School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, RMIT University and Kirsty Wilson, Postdoctoral Research Fellow, RMIT University.

        "The proliferation of fake news about the COVID-19 pandemic has been labelled a dangerous \u201cinfodemic\u201d. Fake news spreads faster and more easily today through the internet, social media and instant messaging. These messages may contain useless, incorrect or even harmful information and advice, which can hamper the public health response and add to social disorder and division.\n\nConfusingly some fake news also contains a mixture of correct information, which makes it difficult to spot what is true and accurate. Fake news may also be shared by trusted friends and family, including those who are doctors and nurses. They might not have read the full story before sharing or just glanced over it. Before you decide to share, make sure to read stories properly and follow some checks to determine the accuracy.\n\nIf the story appears to claim a much higher level of certainty in its advice and arguments than other stories, this is questionable. People will be seeking certainty in a time of high uncertainty, anxiety and panic. So it is only natural to more readily accept information that resolves, reassures and provides easy solutions \u2013 unfortunately, often in a false way.\n\nSimilarly, if a story is more surprising or upsetting than other stories it is worth double-checking, as fake news will try to grab your attention by being more exaggerated than real stories.\n\nWhat to look out for\n\nSource. Question the source. References have been made to \u201cTaiwanese experts\u201d or \u201cJapanese doctors\u201d or \u201cStanford University\u201d during the outbreak. Check on official websites if stories are repeated there. If a source is \u201ca friend of a friend\u201d, this is a rumour unless you also know the person directly.\n\nLogo: Check whether any organisation\u2019s logo used in the message looks the same as on the official website.\n\nBad English: Credible journalists and organisations are less likely to make repeated spelling and grammar mistakes. Also, anything written entirely in capital letters or containing a lot of exclamation marks should raise your suspicions.\n\nPretend social media accounts: Some fake accounts mimic the real thing. For example, the unofficial Twitter handle @BBCNewsTonight, which was made to look like the legitimate @BBCNews account, shared a fake story about the actor Daniel Radcliffe testing positive for coronavirus. Media platforms try to remove or flag fake accounts and stories as well as verify real ones. Look out for what their policies are to try to do this.\n\nOver-encouragement to share: Be wary if the message presses you to share \u2013 this is how viral messaging works.\n\nUse fact-checking websites: Websites such as APFactCheck and Full Fact highlight common fake news stories. You can also use a search engine to look up the title of the article to see if it has been identified as fake news by the mainstream media.\n\nWho to trust\n\nThe best sources to go to for health information about COVID-19 are your government health websites and the World Health Organization website. Primary sources are generally better than news articles.\n\nEven government messaging and the mainstream media can get things wrong, but they are more trustworthy than unverified sources on social media and viral messaging. For instance, The Conversation is a more trusted source because all content is written by academics who are experts in their fields.\n\nA time of high uncertainty. How Hwee Young/EPA\n\nCharlatans have been promoting false preventions and cures for people to spend their money on. For example, the New York attorney general has had to send cease and desist notices for claims that toothpaste, dietary supplements and creams will prevent and cure COVID-19.\n\nThe effects can also be more serious than losing some cash. Iran has reported at least 44 people died from alcohol poisoning after drinking bootleg alcohol in a misguided attempt to cure COVID-19.\n\nUnfortunately, the most basic and correct advice given so far does not offer a miracle or special insight. Wash your hands often (use hand sanitisers if you cannot), avoid touching your face, and sneeze or cough into the crook of your elbow or a tissue (and throw it away in a bag-lined bin). Avoid crowds and public places, keep a sensible distance from people, and do not travel unless absolutely necessary. Now many governments are introducing measures including travel bans and quarantines that need to be followed to protect the health of everyone, especially the most vulnerable.\n\nWe can all get caught out. Think twice about the messages currently circulating and help guide your family and friends to decide what to trust.\n\nBy Samantha Vanderslott, Postdoctoral Researcher in Social Sciences, University of Oxford.

        "Picture this: it\u2019s April 2020, you\u2019re between Zoom meetings, and scrolling through your social media newsfeed. Headlines like \u201cDeath toll continues to rise\u201d, \u201cCOVID-19 may cause long-term health implications\u201d and \u201cHealth-care systems overwhelmed\u201d flash across your screen. Your mood takes a dive, but you can\u2019t stop scrolling.\n\nIf this scenario rings true for you, you\u2019re not alone. Research shows people have a tendency to seek out information during uncertain times \u2013 it\u2019s a natural coping mechanism. But is persistent information-seeking on social media, sometimes called doomscrolling, helpful during a pandemic, or any time?\n\nResearch on the effects of bad news on mood more generally suggest exposure to negative COVID news is likely to be detrimental to our emotional wellbeing. And indeed, early evidence on the effects of COVID news consumption on mental distress reflected this. For instance, one study conducted in March 2020 involving more than 6,000 Americans found that the more time participants spent consuming COVID news in a day, the unhappier they felt.\n\nThese findings are striking but leave a few key questions unanswered. Does doomscrolling make people unhappy, or are unhappy people just more likely to doomscroll? How much time spent doomscrolling is a problem? And what would happen if, instead of doomscrolling, we were \u201ckindness scrolling\u201d \u2013 reading about humanity\u2019s positive responses to a global crisis?\n\nTo find out, we conducted a study where we showed hundreds of people real-world content on either Twitter or YouTube for two to four minutes. The Twitter feeds and YouTube videos featured either general news about COVID, or news about kindness during COVID. We then measured these participants\u2019 moods using a questionnaire, and compared their moods with participants who did not engage with any content at all.\n\nPeople who were shown general COVID-related news experienced lower moods than people who were shown nothing at all. Meanwhile, people who were shown COVID news stories involving acts of kindness didn\u2019t experience the same decline in mood, but also didn\u2019t gain the boost in mood we\u2019d predicted.\n\nThese findings suggest that spending as little as two to four minutes consuming negative news about COVID-19 can have a detrimental impact on our mood.\n\nAlthough we didn\u2019t see an improvement in mood among participants who were shown positive news stories involving acts of kindness, this may be because the stories were still related to COVID. In other research, positive news stories have been associated with improvements in mood.\n\nMaking your social media a more positive place\n\nOur research was published earlier this month. Ironically, news coverage of our findings, with headlines such as \u201cJust five minutes spent on social media is enough to make you miserable, study finds\u201d, could be part of a person\u2019s doomscrolling content.\n\nBut we didn\u2019t find that all social media use makes people miserable. Rather, we found that consuming negative content about COVID via Twitter or YouTube in the midst of a pandemic does.\n\nSo what can we do to look after ourselves, and make our time on social media more pleasurable?\n\nWe found that just a few minutes consuming negative news about COVID-19 can have a detrimental impact on our mood. Nuchylee/Shutterstock\n\nOne option is to delete our social media accounts altogether. Figures show almost half of Facebook users in the UK and the US considered leaving the platform in 2020.\n\nBut how realistic is it to distance ourselves from platforms that connect nearly half of the world\u2019s population, particularly when these platforms offer social interactions at a time when face-to-face interactions can be risky, or impossible?\n\nGiven that avoidance might not be practical, here are some other ways to make your experience on social media more positive.\n\nBe mindful of what you consume on social media. If you log on to connect with other people, focus on the personal news and photos shared instead of the latest headlines. Seek out content that makes you happy to balance out your newsfeed. This may be images of cute kittens, beautiful landscapes, drool-worthy food videos or something else. You could even follow a social media account dedicated to sharing only happy and positive news. Use social media to promote positivity and kindness. Sharing good things that are happening in your life can improve your mood, and your positive mood can spread to others. You may also like to compliment others on social media. While this might sound awkward, people will appreciate it more than you think.\n\nImportantly, we\u2019re not suggesting that you avoid all news and negative content. We need to know what\u2019s happening in the world. However, we should also be mindful of our mental health.\n\nAs the pandemic continues to alter our lives and newsfeeds, our findings highlight the importance of being aware of the emotional toll negative news takes on us. But there are steps we can take to mitigate this toll and make our social media a happier place.\n\nBy Kathryn Buchanan, Lecturer, Psychology Department, University of Essex; Gillian Sandstrom, Senior Lecturer, Department of Psychology, University of Essex; Lara Aknin, Distinguished Associate Professor of Psychology, Simon Fraser University, and Shaaba Lotun, PhD candidate, Department of Psychology, University of Essex.

        "Social distancing due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the threat of COVID-19 has meant online communication is more popular than ever, with even casual parenting groups discovering the previous enterprise video conferencing tool Zoom.\n\nBut how will that affect communications? Have you ever met someone who is stiff in person but great on camera or the other way around? Neuroscientists study brain and behavior and in a recent study found that a person's gaze is altered during tele-communication if they think that the person on the other end of the conversation can see them.\n\nPeople are very sensitive to the gaze direction of others and even two-day-old infants prefer faces where the eyes are looking directly back at them. The phenomenon known as \"gaze cueing,\" a powerful signal for orienting attention, is a mechanism that likely plays a role in the developmentally and socially important wonder of \"shared\" or \"joint\" attention where a number of people attend to the same object or location. The ability to do this is what makes humans unique among primates.\n\nThroughout almost all of human history, conversations were generally conducted face-to-face, so people knew where their conversational partner was looking and vice versa. Now, with virtual communication, that assumption no longer holds - sometimes people communicate with both cameras on while other times only the speaker may be visible. The researchers set out to determine whether being observed affects people's behavior during online communication.\n\nCo-authors Elan Barenholtz, Ph.D., associate professor of psychology at Florida Atlantic University, and Michael H. Kleiman, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher, compared fixation behavior in 173 participants under two conditions: one in which the participants believed they were engaging in a real-time interaction and one in which they knew they were watching a pre-recorded video.\n\nThe researchers wanted to know if face fixation would increase in the real-time condition based on the social expectation of facing one's speaker in order to get attention or if it would lead to greater face avoidance, based on social norms as well as the cognitive demands of encoding the conversation.\n\nSimilarly, they wanted to know where participants would fixate on the face. Would it be the eyes more in the real-time condition because of social demands to make eye contact with one's speaker? Or, in the pre-recorded condition, where the social demands to make eye contact are eliminated, would participants spend more time looking at the mouth in order to encode the conversation, which is consistent with previous studies showing greater mouth fixations during an encoding task.\n\nThree areas of interest for fixation analyses: full face (purple), eyes (red) and mouth (blue). Credit: Florida Atlantic University\n\nResults of the study showed that participants fixated on the whole face in the real-time condition and significantly less in the pre-recorded condition. In the pre-recorded condition, time spent fixating on the mouth was significantly greater compared to the real-time condition.\n\nThere were no significant differences in time spent fixating on the eyes between the real-time and the pre-recorded conditions. These findings may suggest that participants are more comfortable looking directly at the mouth of a speaker - which has previously been found to be optimal for encoding speech - when they think that no one is watching them.\n\nTo simulate a live interaction, the researchers convinced participants that they were engaging in a real-time, two-way video interaction (it was actually pre-recorded) where they could been seen and heard by the speaker, as well as a pre-recorded interaction where they knew the video was previously recorded and therefore the speaker could not see their behavior.\n\n\"Because gaze direction conveys so much socially relevant information, one's own gaze behavior is likely to be affected by whether one's eyes are visible to a speaker,\" said Barenholtz. \"For example, people may intend to signal that they are paying more attention to a speaker by fixating their face or eyes during a conversation. Conversely, extended eye contact also can be perceived as aggressive and therefore noticing one's eyes could lead to reduced direct fixation of another's face or eyes. Indeed, people engage in avoidant eye movements by periodically breaking and reforming eye contact during conversations.\"\n\nThere was a highly significant tendency for participants engaging in perceived real-time interaction to display greater avoidant fixation behavior, which supports the idea that social contexts draw fixations away from the face compared to when social context is not a factor. When the face was fixated, attention was directed toward the mouth for the greater percentage of time in the pre-recorded condition versus the real-time condition. The lack of difference in time spent fixating the eyes suggests that the additional mouth fixations in the pre-recorded condition did not come at the cost of reduced eye fixation and must have derived from reduced fixations elsewhere on the face.\n\nComparisons between total fixation durations of the eyes versus the mouth were calculated for both the real-time and pre-recorded conditions, with the eyes of both conditions being significantly more fixated than the mouth. Gender, age, cultural background, and native language did not have an influence on fixation behavior across conditions.\n\n\"Regardless of the specific mechanisms underlying the observed differences in fixation patterns, results from our study suggest participants were taking social and attentional considerations into account in the real-time condition,\" said Barenholtz. \"Given that encoding and memory have been found to be optimized by fixating the mouth, which was reduced overall in the real-time condition, this suggests that people do not fully optimize for speech encoding in a live interaction.\""

        "This article was originally featured on KHN.\n\nAfter more than a week of record-breaking temperatures across much of the country, public health experts are cautioning that children are more susceptible to heat illness than adults are\u2014even more so when they\u2019re on the athletic field, living without air conditioning, or waiting in a parked car.\n\nCases of heat-related illness are rising with average air temperatures, and experts say almost half of those getting sick are children. The reason is twofold: Children\u2019s bodies have more trouble regulating temperature than those of adults, and they rely on adults to help protect them from overheating.\n\nParents, coaches, and other caretakers, who can experience the same heat very differently than kids do, may struggle to identify a dangerous situation or catch the early symptoms of heat-related illness in children.\n\n\u201cChildren are not little adults,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Bernstein, a pediatric hospitalist at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nJan Null, a meteorologist in California, recalled being surprised at the effect of heat in a car. It was 86 degrees on a July afternoon more than two decades ago when an infant in San Jose was forgotten in a parked car and died of heatstroke.\n\nNull said a reporter asked him after the death, \u201cHow hot could it have gotten in that car?\u201d\n\nNull\u2019s research with two emergency doctors at Stanford University eventually produced a startling answer. Within an hour, the temperature in that car could have exceeded 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Their work revealed that a quick errand can be dangerous for a kid left behind in the car\u2014even for less than 15 minutes, even with the windows cracked, and even on a mild day.\n\nAs record heat becomes more frequent, posing serious risks even to healthy adults, the number of cases of heat-related illnesses has gone up, including among children. Those most at risk are young children in parked vehicles and adolescents returning to school and participating in sports during the hottest days of the year.\n\nMore than 9,000 high school athletes are treated for heat-related illnesses every year.\n\nHeat-related illnesses occur when exposure to high temperatures and humidity, which can be intensified by physical exertion, overwhelms the body\u2019s ability to cool itself. Cases range from mild, like benign heat rashes in infants, to more serious, when the body\u2019s core temperature increases. That can lead to life-threatening instances of heatstroke, diagnosed once the body temperature rises above 104 degrees, potentially causing organ failure.\n\nPrevention is key. Experts emphasize that drinking plenty of water, avoiding the outdoors during the hot midday and afternoon hours, and taking it slow when adjusting to exercise are the most effective ways to avoid getting sick.\n\nChildren\u2019s bodies take longer to increase sweat production and otherwise acclimatize in a warm environment than adults\u2019 do, research shows. Young kids are also more susceptible to dehydration because a larger percentage of their body weight is water.\n\nInfants and younger children also have more trouble regulating their body temperature, in part because they often don\u2019t recognize when they should drink more water or remove clothing to cool down. A 1995 study showed that young children who spent 30 minutes in a 95-degree room saw their core temperatures rise significantly higher and faster than their mothers\u2019\u2014even though they sweat more than adults do relative to their size.\n\nPediatricians advise caretakers to monitor how much water children consume and encourage them to drink before they ask for it. Thirst indicates the body is already dehydrated.\n\nThey should also dress kids in light-colored, lightweight clothes; limit outdoor time during the hottest hours; and look for ways to cool down, such as by visiting an air-conditioned place like a library, taking a cool bath, or going for a swim.\n\nTo address the risks to student athletes, the National Athletic Trainers\u2019 Association recommends that high school athletes acclimatize by gradually building their activity over the course of two weeks when returning to their sport for a new season\u2014including by slowly stepping up the amount of any protective equipment they wear.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re gradually increasing that intensity over a week to two weeks so your body can get used to the heat,\u201d said Kathy Dieringer, president of NATA.\n\nWarning signs and solutions\n\nExperts note a flushed face, fatigue, muscle cramps, headache, dizziness, vomiting, and a lot of sweating are among the symptoms of heat exhaustion, which can develop into heatstroke if untreated. Call a doctor if symptoms worsen, such as if the child seems disoriented or cannot drink.\n\nTaking immediate steps to cool a child experiencing heat exhaustion or heatstroke is critical. The child should be taken to a shaded or cool area; be given cool fluids with salt, like sports drinks; and have any sweaty or heavy garments removed.\n\nFor adolescents, being submerged in an ice bath is the most effective way to cool the body, while younger children can be wrapped in cold, wet towels or misted with lukewarm water and placed in front of a fan.\n\nAlthough children\u2019s deaths in parked cars have been well documented, the tragic incidents continue to occur. According to federal statistics, 23 children died of vehicular heatstroke in 2021. Null, who collects his own data, said 13 children have died so far this year.\n\nCaretakers should never leave children alone in a parked car, Null said. Take steps to prevent young children from entering the car themselves and becoming trapped, including locking the car while it\u2019s parked at home.\n\nMore than half of cases of vehicular pediatric heatstroke occur because a caretaker accidentally left a child behind, he said. While in-car technology reminding adults to check their back seats has become more common, only a fraction of vehicles have it, requiring parents to come up with their own methods, like leaving a stuffed animal in the front seat.\n\nThe good news, Null said, is that simple behavioral changes can protect kids. \u201cThis is preventable in 100% of the cases,\u201d he said.\n\nA lopsided risk\n\nPeople living in low-income areas fare worse when temperatures climb. Access to air conditioning, which includes the ability to afford the electricity bill, is a serious health concern.\n\nA study of heat in urban areas released last year showed that low-income neighborhoods and communities of color experience much higher temperatures than those of wealthier, white residents. In more impoverished areas during the summer, temperatures can be as much as 7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer.\n\nThe study\u2019s authors said their findings in the United States reflect that \u201cthe legacy of redlining looms large,\u201d referring to a federal housing policy that refused to insure mortgages in or near predominantly Black neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cThese areas have less tree canopy, more streets, and higher building densities, meaning that in addition to their other racist outcomes, redlining policies directly codified into law existing disparity in urban land use and reinforced urban design choices that magnify urban heating into the present,\u201d they concluded.\n\nThis month, Bernstein, who leads Harvard\u2019s Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment, co-authored a commentary in JAMA arguing that advancing health equity is critical to action on climate change.\n\nThe center works with front-line health clinics to help their predominantly low-income patients respond to the health impacts of climate change. Federally backed clinics alone provide care to about 30 million Americans, including many children, he said.\n\nBernstein also recently led a nationwide study that found that from May through September, days with higher temperatures are associated with more visits to children\u2019s hospital emergency rooms. Many visits were more directly linked to heat, although the study also pointed to how high temperatures can exacerbate existing health conditions like neurological disorders.\n\n\u201cChildren are more vulnerable to climate change through how these climate shocks reshape the world in which they grow up,\u201d Bernstein said.\n\nHelping people better understand the health risks of extreme heat and how to protect themselves and their families are among the public health system\u2019s major challenges, experts said.\n\nThe National Weather Service\u2019s heat alert system is mainly based on the heat index, a measure of how hot it feels when relative humidity is factored in with air temperature.\n\nBut the alerts are not related to effects on health, said Kathy Baughman McLeod, director of the Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center. By the time temperatures rise to the level that a weather alert is issued, many vulnerable people\u2014like children, pregnant women, and the elderly\u2014may already be experiencing heat exhaustion or heatstroke.\n\nThe center developed a new heat alert system, which is being tested in Seville, Spain, historically one of the hottest cities in Europe.\n\nThe system marries metrics like air temperature and humidity with public health data to categorize heat waves and, when they are serious enough, give them names \u2014 making it easier for people to understand heat as an environmental threat that requires prevention measures.\n\nThe categories are determined through a metric known as excess deaths, which compares how many people died on a day with the forecasted temperature versus an average day. That may help health officials understand how severe a heat wave is expected to be and make informed recommendations to the public based on risk factors like age or medical history.\n\nThe health-based alert system would also allow officials to target caretakers of children and seniors through school systems, preschools, and senior centers, Baughman McLeod said.\n\nGiving people better ways to conceptualize heat is critical, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not dramatic. It doesn\u2019t rip the roof off of your house,\u201d Baughman McLeod said. \u201cIt\u2019s silent and invisible.\u201d\n\nKHN (Kaiser Health News) is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.

        "According to a study by Tufts University and the University of Oxford, the varicella zoster virus (VZV), which may activate the herpes simplex virus (HSV), may help trigger the first stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nAs published in the Journal of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, HSV-1 affects the neurons in the brain and upon activation may result in the accumulation of tau and amyloid beta proteins, widely believed to be found in Alzheimer\u2019s patients.\n\nFrom the study: \u201cWe infected human-induced neural stem cell (hiNSC) cultures with HSV-1 and/or VZV and sought the presence of AD-related phenotypes such as amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and P-tau accumulation, gliosis, and neuroinflammation.\u201d\n\n\u201cCells infected with VZV did not show the main AD characteristics, A\u03b2 and P-tau accumulation, which HSV-1 does cause, but did show gliosis and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that VZV\u2019s action relating to AD/dementia is indirect.\u201d\n\nWhat the authors concluded: \u201cOur results are consistent with the suggestion that shingles causes reactivation of HSV1 in brain and with the protective effects against AD of various vaccines, as well as the decrease in herpes labialis reported after certain types of vaccination. They support an indirect role for VZV in AD/dementia via reactivation of HSV-1 in brain.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Getty Images",

        "Across the internet, I keep reading about some relationships between vitamin D levels and COVID-19. I\u2019ve written about it twice (here and here), but I have never seen reliable, robust, and repeated clinical trial data that supports a link between vitamin D levels or deficiencies and COVID-19.\n\nSo, I thought I would take a look at it once again, and see if there\u2019s anything there. I keep wondering if vitamin D is just another \u201cmiracle supplement\u201d that, once you scratch the surface of data, you find that there is actually nothing there.\n\nWhat we know or think we know about COVID-19 seems to change daily, partially because the disease caught us by surprise. But every day we seem to get new data that contradicts something we thought or adds to our knowledge of the disease. And sometimes both.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the current data on vitamin D and COVID-19.\n\nPhoto by ready made on Pexels.com\n\nWhat is vitamin D?\n\nVitamin D is a group of fat-soluble secosteroids (it\u2019s a scientific name for steroids with a \u201cbroken\u201d ring). The most important chemicals in this group are vitamin D 3 (known as cholecalciferol) and D 2 (known as ergocalciferol).\n\nGenerally, when we measure vitamin D levels in the blood, we measure calcifediol (also written as 25(OH)D), which is a form of vitamin D produced in the liver by the hydroxylation of vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) by the enzyme vitamin D 25-hydroxylase.\n\nVery few foods contain either of the important types of vitamin D. However, some foods can be good sources of the vitamin:\n\nFatty fish, like tuna, mackerel, and salmon\n\nFoods fortified with vitamin D, like some dairy products, orange juice, soy milk, and cereals\n\nBeef liver\n\nCheese\n\nEgg yolks\n\nMany people with broad diets that include a lot of fish, eggs, and other foods can get sufficient vitamin D without supplementation. As I\u2019ve repeated often, short of chronic malnutrition, we get plenty of vitamin D.\n\nMoreover, vitamin D is produced by a process called dermal synthesis. That is, sunlight, specifically UV-B radiation, causes the synthesis of vitamin D in the skin. Technically, vitamin D isn\u2019t a vitamin, because we can manufacture it, it is a hormone. For this article, we\u2019ll just call it a vitamin, even though scientifically it is not.\n\nAlthough we can manufacture sufficient vitamin D by sunbathing every day, the body has a feedback loop that shuts down production to prevent toxicity. Yes, excess vitamin D is quite dangerous leading to many conditions such as over-absorption of calcium, from hypertension to fatigue. But it also can lead to some dangerous chronic conditions that we\u2019ll discuss later.\n\nAlthough humans can manufacture vitamin D by sitting in bright sun, there\u2019s one major problem \u2013 the risk of skin cancer. As I\u2019ve written before, there are very few ways to prevent cancer, but staying out of the sun is one of them.\n\nFinally, the vitamin D we consume or produce in sunlight is not biologically active. It is generally activated by enzymatic conversion (in a process called hydroxylation) in the kidneys and liver so that the body can use it.\n\nWhat does vitamin D do or don\u2019t do?\n\nBased on real scientific evidence, vitamin D has a very narrow, but important, set of effects.\n\nFirst, it is responsible for enhancing intestinal absorption of calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphate, and zinc, important minerals for the continued health of any human being. Many of these minerals (and vitamin D itself) are necessary for good bone health.\n\nSecond, since vitamin D is important to calcium homeostasis and metabolism, a deficiency of the vitamin results in rickets, or the adult form of the disease, osteomalacia. Rickets, because it happens in immature bones, leads to frequent fractures and skeletal deformities. Osteomalacia, because it occurs in adults with fully formed bones, usually only results in numerous fractures.\n\nAt this point, that\u2019s it. Robust evidence only supports those two physiological effects.\n\nHowever, here are a few claims made by the supplement-pushing crowd:\n\nDespite this utter lack of evidence, vitamin D has continued to be the panacea for all that ails humans. For those of us who only care about large, high-quality, peer-reviewed studies, vitamin D is overrated, unless you need to prevent rickets.\n\nPhoto by Pixabay on Pexels.com\n\nVitamin D and COVID-19 \u2014 clinical evidence\n\nAfter over two years of this pandemic, I assumed that there would be a lot of clinical evidence that would be published on the links (or lack thereof) between vitamin D levels and COVID-19. I am not going to review every single clinical trial that\u2019s been published because that would take forever. I\u2019m going to focus on high-quality studies (specifically systematic reviews or meta-analyses, which are at the top of the hierarchy of medical research) if any are available.\n\nIn a systematic review published in June 2021, the researchers examined 31 peer-reviewed observational studies that examined potential links between COVID-19 and vitamin D. There results did not find any statistically significant associations between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 outcomes. Many of the studies were of poor design or poor quality.\n\nThe authors concluded:\n\nWhile the available evidence to-date, from largely poor-quality observational studies, may be viewed as showing a trend for an association between low serum 25(OH)D levels and COVID-19 related health outcomes, this relationship was not found to be statistically significant. Calcifediol supplementation may have a protective effect on COVID-19 related ICU admissions. The current use of high doses of vitamin D in COVID-19 patients is not based on solid evidence. It awaits results from ongoing trials to determine the efficacy, desirable doses, and safety, of vitamin D supplementation to prevent and treat COVID-19 related health outcomes.\n\nAnother systematic review, published on 28 June 2021, showed a similar lack of association between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 outcomes. They examined five studies, which included a total of 467 patients (an incredibly small number), vitamin D levels were not linked to reduced mortality, reduced ICU admissions, and reduced requirements for ventilation.\n\nThe authors concluded:\n\nNo significant difference with vitamin-D supplementation on major health related outcomes in COVID-19. Well-designed RCTs are required addressing this topic.\n\nIn a meta-analysis published on 10 October 2020, the researchers were a bit more enthusiastic about vitamin D and COVID-19. The researchers analyzed six clinical studies. They found that patients with significantly lower serum levels of vitamin D had statistically higher risks of poorer COVID-19 outcomes.\n\nThe authors concluded that:\n\nSerum vitamin D levels could be implicated in the COVID-19 prognosis. Diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency could be a helpful adjunct in assessing patients\u2019 potential of developing severe COVID-19. Appropriate preventative and/or therapeutic intervention may improve COVID-19 outcomes.\n\nIn a meta-analysis published on 19 May 2021, researchers examined results from 532 patients in three separate studies. There appeared to be a statistically lower ICU requirement in those who received vitamin D supplementation compared to those that didn\u2019t.\n\nIn one more meta-analysis published on 23 September 2021, the researchers examined 21 studies that were found to be relevant to the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19 infection/outcomes. This included 205,869 total patients. I would consider this to be the most robust of the meta-analyses and systematic reviews that I have examined.\n\nThe results of this meta-analysis were:\n\nIndividuals with low serum vitamin D levels were 1.64X more likely to contract COVID-19.\n\nwere 1.64X more likely to contract COVID-19. The researchers found that people with serum 25(OH)D levels below 20 ng/mL or 50 nmol/L were 2.42X more likely to have severe COVID-19.\n\nHowever, the researchers found that low vitamin D levels did not affect COVID-19 mortality.\n\nSummary\n\nSo what are our takeaways from all of this data?\n\nIt\u2019s a bit all over the place, though the final meta-analysis I reviewed seemed to provide good (but not great) evidence that supports the hypothesis that lower blood vitamin D levels may lead to worse outcomes from COVID-19.\n\nBut that leads to two important claims made about vitamin D:\n\nThere is no evidence vitamin D can prevent COVID-19 except when used as a supplement when someone has a known vitamin D deficiency. Megadoses of vitamin D can be dangerous and do not improve COVID-19 outcomes.\n\nAnd we don\u2019t know why low vitamin D levels are linked to worse COVID-19 outcomes. It could be that individuals with low vitamin D levels have a lower immune response compared to those with normal vitamin D levels. And no, this does not mean that more vitamin D is going to miraculously boost your immune system so that COVID-19 will never strike. Get that out of your thinking immediately, because none of this evidence supports such a claim.\n\nAnd one more thing \u2014 we have zero evidence regarding vitamin D levels and outcomes from the new omicron variants. Maybe it\u2019s the same as COVID-19 in general, or maybe there\u2019s a difference. We will see.\n\nCitations\n\n________________________________________________Please comment below, positive or negative. Of course, if you find spelling errors, tell me!

        "Complete vaccination against COVID-19 was linked to a reduced risk of cardiovascular events such as acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke as secondary complications of a COVID-19 infection. These results were published in a peer-reviewed journal recently.\n\nThis is another huge benefit of COVID-19 vaccination that should be convincing evidence that the vaccine has both short- and long-term benefits.\n\nAs I usually do, I will review the study and results so that you can use this paper as further evidence that COVID-19 vaccination saves lives.\n\nPhoto by Jair L\u00e1zaro on Unsplash\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination and reduced cardiovascular risks paper\n\nIn a research letter published on 22 July 2022 in JAMA, Jaehun Jung, MD, Ph.D., of Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea, and colleagues examined cardiovascular events in the 31 to 120 days after COVID-19 diagnosis for the fully vaccinated compared with those not vaccinated. Jung and colleagues compared COVID-19 patients who were never vaccinated (n=62,727) to those who were fully vaccinated (n=168,310). They used nationwide data Korean nationwide COVID-19 registry and the Korean National Health Insurance Service database.

        "This article about the settlement of a lawsuit and COVID-19 vaccine religious exemptions was written by Dorit Rubinstein Reiss, Professor of Law at the University of California Hastings College of the Law (San Francisco, CA), who is a frequent contributor to this and many other blogs, providing in-depth, and intellectually stimulating, articles about vaccines, medical issues, social policy, and the law.\n\nProfessor Reiss writes extensively in law journals about vaccination\u2019s social and legal policies. Additionally, Reiss is also a member of the Parent Advisory Board of Voices for Vaccines, a parent-led organization that supports and advocates for on-time vaccination and the reduction of vaccine-preventable diseases. She is also a member of the Vaccines Working Group on Ethics and Policy.\n\nHeadlines about a settlement between healthcare workers and their employer related to COVID-19 vaccine religious exemptions led people to ask what is the relevance of that settlement. This post explains this settlement and puts the issue in context.\n\nThree points need to be made:\n\nFirst, this is not the first time an employer settled a claim for denial of religious exemption.\n\nSecond, sometimes the settlement is the result of an employer making mistakes in handling religious exemptions and having a really bad case, and settling is the right thing.\n\nThird, in legal terms, the settlement has no relevance to any other case. In practical terms, though, it can be used to put pressure on other employers, even when those employers are on legally solid ground.\n\nPhoto by cottonbro on Pexels.com\n\nBackground on COVID-19 vaccine religious exemption lawsuit\n\nApparently, Northshore University Healthsystem, a health system with over 17,000 employees, imposed a vaccine mandate. They allowed employees to apply for a religious exemption. Five hundred twenty-three employees had their religious exemptions denied \u2013 we do not know what the process was or why the requests were denied, though articles about the case mentioned that the workers cited the use of cell lines in vaccines \u2013 which might be an issue for these employers now, since Novavax, recently authorized for use, does not use such cell lines in their vaccine, so they now have another option.\n\nOut of those employees, Northshore \u201cestimate[d]\u201d in the settlement, about 204 got the vaccine and remained employed, and 269 were fired or resigned.\n\nFourteen of these employees filed a lawsuit claiming religious discrimination, though one of them \u2013 who had a religious exemption granted \u2013 dropped out since she has no case. The conservative organization Liberty Counsel apparently represented them. Note, that this is not an anti-vaccine group, but it is a conservative group that is willing to support claims of religious freedom. On July 29, 2022, the parties submit a settlement to the federal district court in the northern district of Illinois. I will address the settlement below, but let\u2019s start with some legal context.\n\nLegal context\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers with more than 15 employees from discriminating against employees based on, among other things, religion. If an employee has a sincere religious belief that conflicts with a workplace rule, an employer is supposed to provide a reasonable accommodation, unless it\u2019s an undue burden. There are many moving parts here, and the EEOC addressed them in detailed guidance, and I wrote about them in a shorter form before.\n\nBut for the basis of this settlement, the main issue is that an employer needs to provide an accommodation if the religious belief is sincere. In spite of what some observers wrote about this settlement, this means employers can engage in some inquiries into the sincerity of the belief. The EEOC explains:\n\nGenerally, under Title VII, an employer should proceed on the assumption that a request for religious accommodation is based on sincerely held religious beliefs, practices, or observances. However, if an employer has an objective basis for questioning either the religious nature or the sincerity of a particular belief, the employer would be justified in making a limited factual inquiry and seeking additional supporting information. An employee who fails to cooperate with an employer\u2019s reasonable requests for verification of the sincerity or religious nature of a professed belief, practice, or observance risks losing any subsequent claim that the employer improperly denied an accommodation.\n\nHowever, assessing sincerity is full of pitfalls, enough to justify multiple articles on the topic. And employers have made mistakes in this area long before COVID-19, as the cases detailed in these articles show.\n\nIn short, there are some things employers should not do, and generally, if the employer appears to be acting arbitrarily or in bad faith, employers are taking a legal risk. Employers cannot condition an exemption on a letter from a religious leader, because that discriminates against believers who are not members of organized religions.\n\nIn addition, employers cannot try and assess the rationality of the employee\u2019s belief. And employers cannot refuse an exemption just because the employee\u2019s home religion supports vaccines \u2014 e.g. refuse an exemption to a Catholic because the Pope spoke in favor of COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 because their job is not to enforce the religion\u2019s rules on the employee, just to avoid discriminating against employees whose religion may conflict with a workplace rule.\n\nAnd again, an appearance of bad faith would work against the employer, even if it does not fall into these categories. For example, when I saw this case filed, I suspected the company is likely to lose if the allegations are true because its behavior looked like bad faith. In this case, apparently, the company required people requesting a religious exemption to sign that they agree that if their exemption is denied they are resigning, and then denied all exemptions, including those they found sincere.\n\nThis looks like the company pretended to offer a religious exemption and then did not take it seriously. That looks like bad faith. The company would likely have done better, if that was its intent, to openly say they will give no religious exemption and justify that, and stand on those grounds.\n\nNot only are disputes about the way employers monitor sincerity not new, but settlements of them are not new. Before COVID-19 I blogged about several of those. Note that some of the settlements here reflect an acknowledgment of the hospital that it made mistakes in implementing religious exemptions.\n\nThis is a tricky area of law, and mistakes can happen. However, that\u2019s not always the case. Settlements can also happen when a party thinks it has a good chance of winning but the litigation costs will be too high. Settlements do not have to be accurate, and in fact, may well not be a good reflection of the merits of the case. Settlements are private agreements between the parties, and they are often opaque, as is the reasoning behind them. In fact, it is usual \u2013 though apparently not the case here \u2013 for settlements to have non-disclosure clauses covering the amount and the basis.\n\nAs a final point, remember that settlements in law are binding between the parties to them, but they are not binding beyond the parties to the settlement.\n\nPhoto by Leon Seibert on Unsplash\n\nThe Doe v Northshore University Health Settlement\n\nThe settlement of the COVID-19 vaccine lawsuit applies to all 523 members of the group that was refused religious exemptions and has three parts.\n\nFinancial \u2014 Northshore agrees to create a fund of over ten million dollars, and pay from it: https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/legal-regulatory-issues/northshore-reaches-10-3m-settlement-in-vaccine-mandate-case.html $25,000 per employee that resigned or was dismissed, if they file a claim. $3,000 per employee that got vaccinated and stayed on and files a claim. An additional $20,000 to the thirteen plaintiffs who filed the claim and did not have a religious exemption (one did, and will not be paid).\n\nIn addition, Liberty Counsel will receive $2,061,500 for \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs\u201d for the lawsuit.\n\nWork-related \u2014 Northshore agreed to allow the class members to apply for re-employment. If they apply, they will receive a religious accommodation based on their request and may be rehired (\u201cbased on individual review and determination of qualifications for the open position\u201d \u2013 this clearly also depends on finding an open position). The employee would be rehired at the same level of seniority they had when they resigned or were fired. Operational \u2014 Northshore University Healthsystem will change its exemption process, though the specific changes are unclear. The new program is attached as \u201caddendum 1\u201d to the settlement and is fairly vague.\n\nWhy did NorthShore settle? Well, we do not know. It may be that their process was sufficiently shaky that their lawyers advised that they should settle, that they cannot defend the case. It may be that their lawyers advised that even though their process is appropriate, they are facing a hostile judge and cannot win, or cannot win without extensive litigation costs. The problem in a settlement like this is that it\u2019s not quite clear.\n\nThe complaint suggests that Northshore may have acted in a way that made it vulnerable to challenge, claiming:\n\nInitially, NorthShore denied all or virtually all exemption requests it received, regardless of merit. More recently, after being confronted with the illegality of its conduct, NorthShore switched tactics from denying all of the Plaintiffs\u2019 religious exemption requests to informing them that those same requests will now be \u201dapproved\u201d in theory and name only, but NorthShore then claimed that it would suffer an \u201cundue hardship\u201d if it allowed Plaintiffs to continue in their current positions. Instead, NorthShore has informed some of the Plaintiffs that \u201cit is considering an offer of fully remote work\u201d and the remaining Plaintiffs that they \u201cwill be offered the opportunity to apply for a fully remote position.\u201d NorthShore has not actually made any such offers to any Plaintiff.\n\nThis would suggest that, like the case above, NorthShore offered a religious exemption and never seriously considered any requests \u2013 which would be an issue in a case. But this is the complaint, and we do not know what NorthShore would have said.\n\nIf the complaint is right, this settlement was likely justified \u2013 but it says nothing about other companies that did have a process to review exemptions and did make a good-faith effort to assert sincerity.\n\nWhat does this settlement mean?\n\nAnti-vaccine activists are celebrating the settlement as a large win against vaccine mandates. They\u2019re not completely wrong, but they\u2019re not quite right, either.\n\nLegally, this is not news. Companies have settled cases claiming non-compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964\u2019s requirements before. It is not legal news that a company needs to consider religious exemption requests in good faith, and that wholesale rejection can get you into legal hot water. Nor is this an actual precedent for other companies.\n\nIn fact, legally, if the complaint\u2019s allegations were right, it does not even pose a viable threat for companies that did have a set process for assessing exemptions and did examine the sincerity of religious exemption.\n\nA claim that \u201cThis settlement should also serve as a strong warning to employers across the nation that they cannot refuse to accommodate those with sincere religious objections to forced vaccination mandates,\u201d\n\nThis is technically right, but not really relevant or a barrier for employers putting in place reasonable processes to examine sincerity and is not a barrier for refusing exemptions that seem non-sincere. And the existence of Novavax is going to make exemptions alleging the use of cell lines descended from fetal cells in mRNA vaccines (distant and weak as such use is, and bad an argument as it is even in that context a lot less relevant.\n\nThe problem is that hospitals may not notice these nuances and scared by the headlines, may conclude that they cannot police religious exemptions \u2013 something that this settlement does not mean. NorthShore itself practically agreed in the settlement to accept all exemption requests of the resigning or dismissed workers, even though with Novavax, their claims lose powers. On the plus side, 269 employees out of 17,000 are a trivial number, and not likely to have a huge effect. On the other hand, what happens when the next booster is due? The hospital does not have to automatically accept religious exemptions going forward but may hesitate to reject them.\n\nIf the hospital\u2019s policy was blanket refusal after purporting to give a religious exemption, settling was likely the right choice; the hospital was unlikely to win its case. But this can be misused to intimidate others, including hospitals with better policies, and that\u2019s a concern.\n\n________________________________________________Please comment below, positive or negative.

        "Long-term symptoms of COVID-19\n\nLong COVID or Long-haul COVID[1] is a condition characterized by long-term consequences persisting or appearing after the typical convalescence period of COVID-19. It is also known as post-COVID-19 syndrome, post-COVID-19 condition,[2][3] post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), or chronic COVID syndrome (CCS).[4][5][6] Long COVID can affect nearly every organ system, with sequelae (consequences) including respiratory system disorders, nervous system and neurocognitive disorders, mental health disorders, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, musculoskeletal pain, and anemia.[7] A wide range of symptoms are commonly reported, including fatigue, malaise, headaches, shortness of breath, anosmia (loss of smell), parosmia (distorted smell), muscle weakness, low fever and cognitive dysfunction.[8]\n\nThe exact nature of symptoms and the number of people who experience long-term symptoms are unknown; these vary according to the definition used, the population being studied, and the time period used in the study. A survey by the UK Office for National Statistics estimated that about 14% of people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 experienced one or more symptoms for longer than three months.[9] A study from the University of Oxford of 273,618 survivors of COVID-19, mainly from the United States, showed that about 37% experienced one or more symptoms between three and six months after diagnosis.[10]\n\nWhile studies into various aspects of long COVID are under way,[11][12] as of November 2021 , the definition of the illness is still unclear, as is its mechanism. Health systems in some countries and jurisdictions have been mobilized to deal with this group of patients by creating specialized clinics and providing advice.[13][14][15] Overall, however, it is considered by default to be a diagnosis of exclusion.[16]\n\nA review suggests that global prevalence of long COVID conditions after infection could be as high as 43%, with the most common symptoms being fatigue and memory problems.[17][18]\n\nTerminology and definitions\n\nOverview\n\nLong COVID is a patient-created term which was reportedly first used in May 2020 as a hashtag on Twitter by Elisa Perego, an archaeologist at University College London.[19][20]\n\nLong COVID has no single, strict definition.[21][22] It is normal and expected that people who experience severe symptoms or complications such as post-intensive care syndrome or secondary infections will take longer to recover than people who did not require hospitalization (called mild COVID-19[23]) and had no such complications. It can be difficult to determine whether an individual's set of ongoing symptoms represents a normal, prolonged convalescence, or extended 'long COVID'. One rule of thumb is that long COVID represents symptoms that have been present for longer than two months, though there is no reason to believe that this choice of cutoff is specific to infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.[21]\n\nWorld Health Organization clinical case definition\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) established a clinical case definition in October 2021,[2] published in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases:[3]\n\npost-COVID-19 condition occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, usually 3 months from the onset, with symptoms that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Common symptoms include, but are not limited to, fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive dysfunction, and generally have an impact on everyday functioning. Symptoms might be new onset following initial recovery from an acute COVID-19 episode or persist from the initial illness. Symptoms might also fluctuate or relapse over time.\n\nBritish definition\n\nThe British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) divides COVID-19 into three clinical case definitions:\n\nacute COVID-19 for signs and symptoms during the first four weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the first, and\n\nfor signs and symptoms during the first four weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the first, and long Covid for new or ongoing symptoms four weeks or more after the start of acute COVID-19 , which is divided into the other two: ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 for effects from four to twelve weeks after onset, and post-COVID-19 syndrome for effects that persist 12 or more weeks after onset.\n\n, which is divided into the other two:\n\nNICE describes the term long COVID, which it uses \"in addition to the clinical case definitions\", as \"commonly used to describe signs and symptoms that continue or develop after acute COVID-19. It includes both ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 (from four to twelve weeks) and post-COVID-19 syndrome (12 weeks or more)\".[24]\n\nNICE defines post-COVID-19 syndrome as \"Signs and symptoms that develop during or after an infection consistent with COVID\u201119, continue for more than 12 weeks and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis. It usually presents with clusters of symptoms, often overlapping, which can fluctuate and change over time and can affect any system in the body. Post\u2011COVID\u201119 syndrome may be considered before 12 weeks while the possibility of an alternative underlying disease is also being assessed\".[24]\n\nAmerican definition\n\nIn February 2021, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) director Francis Collins indicated long COVID symptoms for individuals who \"don't recover fully over a period of a few weeks\" be collectively referred to as \"Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection\" (PASC). The NIH listed long COVID symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, brain fog, sleep disorders, intermittent fevers, gastrointestinal symptoms, anxiety, and depression. Symptoms can persist for months and can range from mild to incapacitating, with new symptoms arising well after the time of infection.[25] The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) term Post-Covid Conditions qualifies long Covid as symptoms four or more weeks after first infection.[1]\n\nSymptoms\n\n[26][27] scientific review identified over 50 apparent long-term effects \u2013 including those of 'long COVID' \u2013 along with their estimated prevalence and estimated that 80% of included patients had at least one overall effect beyond two weeks.\n\nA multinational online survey with 3,762 participants with illness lasting more than 28 days found that recovery takes longer than 35 weeks for 91% of them. On average, participants experienced 56 symptoms (standard deviation \u00b1 25.5) in nine organ systems. Symptoms varied over time, and the most common symptoms after six months were fatigue, post-exertional malaise and cognitive dysfunction.[28]\n\nSymptom relapse occurred in 86% of participants triggered by physical or mental effort or by stress. Three groups of symptoms were identified: initial symptoms that peak in the first two to three weeks and then subside; stable symptoms; and symptoms that increase markedly in the first two months and then stabilize.[28]\n\nSymptoms reported by people with long COVID include:[29][30][31][32][33][7][34]\n\nEpidemiology\n\nIn June 2022, a CDC study based on electronic health records showed that \"one in five COVID-19 survivors aged 18\u201364 years and one in four survivors aged \u226565 years experienced at least one incident condition that might be attributable to previous COVID-19\" or long COVID[39][40] and an analysis of private healthcare claims showed that of 78,252 patients diagnosed with 'long COVID', 75.8% had not been hospitalized for COVID-19.[41][42] In people age 0-18 years the prevalence of long COVID conditions \u2013 like mood symptoms, CFS and sleep disorders \u2013 appears to be at ~25% overall.[43][44]\n\nEarlier findings\n\nSome reports of long-term illness after infection appeared early during the COVID-19 pandemic,[45][46] including in people who had a mild (not requiring hospitalization)[47] or moderate (requiring oxygen supplementation)[47] initial infection[48] as well as those who were admitted to hospital with more severe infection.[49][50][scientific citation needed]\n\nAs of January 2021 , the precise incidence was unknown. The incidence declines over time as many people slowly recover. Some early studies suggested that between 20% and 33% of people with COVID-19 experienced symptoms lasting longer than a month.[51][52] A telephone survey in the U.S. in the first half of 2020 showed that about 35% of people who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 experienced a range of symptoms that lasted longer than three weeks.[52] As of December 2020, the Office of National Statistics in the UK estimated that, of all people with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2, about 21% experienced symptoms for longer than five weeks, and about 10% experienced symptoms for longer than 12 weeks.[51][53][54]\n\nSome studies have suggested that some children experience lingering symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.[51][55][56]\n\nAlthough anyone who gets infected can develop long COVID, people who become so sick that they require hospitalization take longer to recover. A majority (up to 80%[57]) of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease experience long-term problems including fatigue and shortness of breath (dyspnoea).[46][58][59] Patients with severe initial infection, particularly those who required mechanical ventilation to help breathing, are also likely to develop post-intensive care syndrome following recovery.[49]\n\nA study of patients who had been hospitalised in Wuhan found that the majority still had at least one symptom after six months. Patients who had been more severely ill still showed severe incapacity in lung function.[32] Among the 1733 patients who had been discharged from hospital and followed up about six months later, the most common symptoms were fatigue or muscle weakness (63%), sleep difficulties (26%), and anxiety or depression (23%).[60]\n\nSome people develop long-term neurological symptoms despite never having been hospitalized for COVID-19; the first study of this population was published in March 2021. Most frequently, these non-hospitalized patients experienced \"prominent and persistent 'brain fog' and fatigue that affect their cognition and quality of life.\"[61][62]\n\nA January 2021 study of UK patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and discharged in 2020 reported that within 140 days, 29% were readmitted to hospital, and 12% of the discharged total had died. Cardivascular and respiratory problems were common, and 5% of patients developed diabetes for the first time.[63]\n\nIn March 2021, the Indonesian Doctors Association, in a survey of 463 people, suggested that 63.5% of respondents self-reported lingering symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The exact set of symptoms was not specified; however, according to the article, fatigue and cough were the most commonly reported symptoms, followed by muscle pain and headache.[64]\n\nIn May 2021, a global systematic review led by researchers at Stanford University reported that a wide variety of symptoms persisted in more than 70% of COVID-19 patients months after recovering from the initial phase of the disease. Most patients in this study were previously hospitalized. The most common lingering symptoms included shortness of breath, fatigue, and sleep disorders. The study reported 84 clinical signs or symptoms, including loss of taste and smell, cognitive disorders such as memory loss and difficulty concentrating, depression, and anxiety.[65]\n\nIn June 2021, a long-term study in Bergen, Norway, found 52% (31/61) of a cohort of home-isolated young adults cases, ages 16\u201330, continued to experience symptoms at six months. The study captured 82% (312) of the pandemic first wave cases: 247 home-isolated and 65 hospitalized.[66][67]\n\nIn August 2021, a study of 1,276 hospital survivors of the early 2020 outbreak in Wuhan reported that, while many symptoms disappeared over time and 88% of those previously employed returned to their original work, 49% of them had at least one sequela 12 months after discharge from the hospital, and the general health status of the group was lower than that of the control population. Women had a greater chance of fatigue, muscle weakness, anxiety, depression, or impaired lung diffusion than men. The study also found that survivors are at greater risk for psychiatric outcomes such as anxiety and depression.[68]\n\nAt first, there was little data on long COVID following breakthrough infections (cases in fully vaccinated people).[69] In July 2021, a study with 1,497 fully vaccinated healthcare professionals in Israel reported that 19% of those testing positive (7 out of 36 infected people) also had long COVID-19 symptoms at 6 weeks or more, with the Alpha variant identified in 85% of positive cases.[70] A September 2021 study published in The Lancet found that having two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine halved the odds of long COVID.[71] However, a May 2022 study published by Nature that examined VA Saint Louis Health Care System records from January to December 2021 of more than 13 million people, including 34,000 people vaccinated against COVID-19 who had breakthrough infections, found that COVID-19 vaccination reduced long COVID risk by about 15%.[72]\n\nAn October 2021 meta-analysis showed that more than 60% of individuals infected by SARS-CoV\u20112 exhibited at least one post-COVID-19 symptom after onset or hospital admission.[73]\n\nCauses\n\nIt is currently unknown why most people recover fully within two to three weeks and others experience symptoms for weeks or months longer.[74] Although the exact processes that cause long COVID remain unknown, a number of mechanisms have been suggested.\n\nA March 2021 review article cited the following pathophysiological processes as the predominant causes of long COVID:[75]\n\ndirect toxicity in virus infected tissue, especially the lungs\n\nongoing inflammation due to post-infection immune system dysregulation\n\nvascular injury and ischemia caused by virus induced hypercoagulability (tendency to form internal clots) and thromboses (internal blood clots)\n\nimpaired regulation of the renin-angiotensin system related to the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on ACE2 containing tissue\n\nIn October 2020, a review by the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health Research hypothesized that ongoing long COVID symptoms may be due to four syndromes:[46][76]\n\nOther situations that might cause new and ongoing symptoms to include:\n\nSimilarities to other syndromes\n\nLong COVID is similar to post-Ebola syndrome and the post-infection syndromes seen in chikungunya and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), which is often triggered by infection and immune activation and was previously also known as \"post-viral fatigue\". The pathophysiology of long COVID may be similar to these other conditions.[21] Some long COVID patients in Canada have been diagnosed with ME/CFS, a \"debilitating, multi-system neurological disease that is believed to be triggered by an infectious illness in the majority of cases\". Lucinda Bateman, a US specialist in ME/CFS in Salt Lake City, believes that the two syndromes are identical. There is need for more research into ME/CFS; Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to the US government, said that COVID-19 is a \"well-identified etiologic agent that should be very helpful now in getting us to be able to understand [ME/CFS]\".[82]\n\nRisk factors\n\nAccording to a King's College London study initially posted on 21 October 2020 risk factors for long COVID may include:[83][84][85]\n\nAge \u2013 particularly those aged over 50\n\nObesity [86]\n\nAsthma\n\nReporting more than five symptoms (e.g., more than a cough, fatigue, headache, diarrhoea, loss of sense of smell) in the first week of COVID-19 infection; five is the median number reported\n\nGender \u2013 Women are less likely to develop severe acute COVID but more likely to develop long COVID than men.[21] Some research suggests this is due primarily to hormonal differences,[87][88] while other research points to other factors, including chromosomal genetics, sex-dependent differences in immune system behavior, and non-biological factors may be relevant.[21]\n\nDiagnosis\n\nXenon MRI is being used to study long COVID, because it provides patients and physicians with explanations for previously unexplained observations. Xenon MRI can measure gas exchange and provide information on how much air is taken up by a patient's bloodstream, which is being researched in long-haul COVID patients.[89][90]\n\nXenon MRI can quantify three components of lung function: ventilation, barrier tissue uptake and gas exchange. Xenon-129 is soluble in pulmonary tissue, which allows the evaluation of lung functions such as perfusion and gas exchange (an advantage over helium). Ventilation measures how the air is distributed in the lung and can provide the locations of potentially compromised lung areas if no xenon reaches those areas. Barrier tissue uptake and gas exchange measure how much air diffuses across the alveolar-capillary membrane. Xenon MRI helps determine how well air is taken in by the lungs, absorbed into lung tissue, and taken up by the blood.[91][90]\n\nHealth system responses\n\nAustralia\n\nIn October 2020, a guide published by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) says that ongoing post-COVID-19 infection symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath and chest pain will require management by GPs, in addition to the more severe conditions already documented.[57]\n\nIn December 2021, research by a health economics expert at Deakin University suggests that even without fully understanding the Omicron variant's effects yet, a further 10,000 to 133,000 long COVID cases are likely to emerge on top of the current approximately 9450 in New South Wales and 19,800 in Victoria, after border and other restrictions had been recently lifted. The RACGP released new guidelines for general practitioners to manage a large number of new long COVID patients.[92]\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIn October 2020, the DATCOV Hospital Surveillance Department of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) looked into a partnership with the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) (an open-access research and data resource)[93] in order to conduct clinical research into the impact PASC may have within the South African context. As of 30 January 2021, the project has yet to receive ethical approval for the commencement of data collection. Ethics approval was granted on 3 February 2021 and formal data collection began on 8 February 2021.[citation needed]\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nIn Britain, the National Health Service set up specialist clinics for the treatment of long COVID.[94] The four Chief Medical Officers of the UK were warned of academic concern over long COVID on 21 September 2020 in a letter written by Trisha Greenhalgh published in The BMJ[95] signed by academics including David Hunter, Martin McKee, Susan Michie, Melinda Mills, Christina Pagel, Stephen Reicher, Gabriel Scally, Devi Sridhar, Charles Tannock, Yee Whye Teh, and Harry Burns, former CMO for Scotland.[95]\n\nIn October 2020, NHS England's head Simon Stevens announced the NHS had committed \u00a310 million to be spent that year on setting up long COVID clinics to assess patients' physical, cognitive, and psychological conditions and to provide specialist treatment. Future clinical guidelines were announced, with further research on 10,000 patients planned and a designated task-force to be set up, along with an online rehabilitation service[96] \u2013 \"Your Covid Recovery\".[97] The clinics include a variety of medical professionals and therapists, with the aim of providing \"joined-up care for physical and mental health\".[54]\n\nThe National Institute for Health Research has allocated funding for research into the mechanisms behind symptoms of long COVID.[54][11]\n\nIn December 2020, University College London Hospitals (UCLH) opened a second long COVID clinic at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery for patients with post-COVID neurological issues. The first clinic had opened in May, primarily focused on respiratory problems, but both clinics refer patients to other specialists where needed, including cardiologists, physiotherapists and psychiatrists.[98] By March 2021 there were 69 long COVID clinics in the English NHS, mostly focussing on assessing patients, with more planned to open. There were fears that community rehabilitation services did not have capacity to manage large numbers of referrals.[99]\n\nOn 18 December 2020, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) published a guide to the management of long COVID.[100] The guideline was reviewed by representatives of the UK doctors #longcovid group, an online support group for COVID long-haulers, who said that it could be improved by introducing a more comprehensive description of the clinical features and physical nature of long COVID, among other changes.[101]\n\nIn November 2021 complaints were reported from NHS staff that neither their employers nor their trades unions were supportive, though the British Medical Association was pushing for long COVID to be classed as an occupational disease.[102]\n\nIn May 2022 demand for occupational therapy led rehabilitation services in Britain was reported to have increased by 82% over the previous six months as occupational therapists were supporting people whose needs have become more complex because of delays in treatment brought about by the pandemic. Half of occupational therapists surveyed were supporting people affected by lasting Covid symptoms.[103]\n\nUnited States\n\nThe physician Anthony S. Fauci has described long-term COVID-19 as \"a phenomenon that is really quite real and quite extensive\", but also said that the number of cases is unknown.[104]\n\nOn 23 February 2021, the National Institutes of Health director, Francis Collins, announced a major initiative to identify the causes and ultimately the means of prevention and treatment of people who have long COVID.[25] Part of this initiative includes the creation of the COVID-19 Project,[105] which will gather data on neurological symptoms associated with PASC.\n\nOn 28 April 2021, the Subcommittee on Health of the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing about long COVID.[106][107] In February 2022, it was announced that at least sixty-six hospitals and health systems had launched COVID recovery programs to aid patients who experience long term or lingering symptoms.[108]\n\nPublic response\n\nSome people experiencing long COVID have formed groups on social media sites.[109][110][111][112] There is an active international long COVID patient advocacy movement[113][114] which includes research led by patients themselves.[115][116] In many of these groups, individuals express frustration and their sense that their problems have been dismissed by medical professionals.[111][112]\n\nSpecial populations\n\nChildren\n\nA study from the Office for National Statistics with 20,000 participants, including children and adults, found that, in children who tested positive, at least one symptom persisted after five weeks in 9.8% of children aged two to eleven years and in 13% of children aged 12 to 16 years.[9] A 2022 University College London study in the UK, found that children ages 11\u201317 who had a positive PCR test for COVID were more likely to have three or more symptoms three months after their diagnosis compared to those with a negative test.[117] A study in Italy, which analyzed 129 children under the age of 18, examined health data obtained via a questionnaire between September 2020 and 1 January 2021. 53% of the group experienced COVID-19 symptoms more than 120 days after their diagnosis, and 43% were still impaired by the symptoms. Symptoms included insomnia, fatigue, muscle pain, chest tightness and pain, nasal congestion, tiredness, and difficulty concentrating.[118][119] A case report of five children in Sweden also reported symptoms (fatigue, heart palpitations, dyspnoea, headaches, muscle weakness and difficulty concentrating) persisting for 6\u20138 months after diagnosis.[55]\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nNews",
        "When many people dismiss COVID-19 as unworthy of needing a vaccine, they almost always ignore the effects of long COVID, the long-term symptoms and sequelae that tend to persist or appear after the typical convalescence period of COVID-19. And new peer-reviewed research shows that long COVID is associated with hair loss and sexual dysfunction \u2014 every male that sees this will be running as fast as they can to get the vaccine.\n\nBut on a more serious note, long COVID is linked to a lot of serious long-term consequences that are often dismissed by anti-vaccine and COVID-19 deniers.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at this new paper and review the results of their analysis. The basic result is that long COVID is scary.\n\nPhoto by Nathan Cowley on Pexels.com\n\nLong COVID paper\n\nIn a paper published on 25 July 2022 in Nature Medicine, Krishnarajah Nirantharakumar, MBBS, MPH, of the University of Birmingham in England, and colleagues found that 62 symptoms were significantly associated with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection after 12 weeks.\n\nThe researchers evaluated 486,149 adults with confirmed COVID-19 from January 2020 to April 2021 who were not hospitalized with an infection, and 1,944,580 propensity score-matched adults with no recorded evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in U.K primary care records. The researchers also assessed relative differences in 115 symptoms 12 weeks after people in the COVID group were infected.\n\nThe symptoms with the highest hazard ratios (HR):\n\nanosmia, loss of sense of smell (HR=6.49, or 6.49X higher risk than in a population without long COVID-19),\n\nhair loss (HR=3.99),\n\nsneezing (HR=2.77),\n\nejaculation difficulty (HR=2.63),\n\nreduced libido, or sex drive (HR=2.36),\n\nshortness of breath at rest (HR=2.20),\n\nfatigue (HR =.92),\n\npleuritic chest pain (HR=1.86),\n\nhoarse voice (HR=1.78)\n\nfever (HR=1.75)\n\nTwenty of the 62 reported symptoms in the paper were among the 33 symptoms listed in the World Health Organization (WHO) clinical case definition of long COVID. Overall, 5.4% of people with COVID and 4.3% of people without COVID reported at least one symptom included in the WHO case definition. The CDC also has a commonly used definition of long COVID.\n\nWomen had an increased risk of long COVID symptoms than men (HR=1.52). Furthermore, ages over 30 were associated with a higher risk of long COVID symptoms, but after adjusting for baseline covariates, people ages 30-39 had a 6% lower risk, and people ages 70 and older had a 25% lower risk than those aged 18-30 years. In other words, it appears that long COVID appears to target younger adults.\n\nHowever, there were other important risk factors for long COVID. Ethnic minority groups, socioeconomic deprivation, smoking, obesity, and other comorbidities have a statistically significant impact on the risk for long COVID.\n\nSummary\n\nLong COVID is a serious complication of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it seems to be ignored by a lot of the anti-vaccine crowd. They ignore the fact that long COVID is not only linked to minor symptoms like anosmia but is also linked to serious long-term diseases like type 2 diabetes. But if I have to stress hair loss and sexual dysfunction as sequelae of long COVID to convince recalcitrant males to get the vaccine, then that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do.\n\nBecause we know that the COVID-19 vaccines reduce the risk of long COVID.\n\nCitations\n\nSubramanian A, Nirantharakumar K, Hughes S, Myles P, Williams T, Gokhale KM, Taverner T, Chandan JS, Brown K, Simms-Williams N, Shah AD, Singh M, Kidy F, Okoth K, Hotham R, Bashir N, Cockburn N, Lee SI, Turner GM, Gkoutos GV, Aiyegbusi OL, McMullan C, Denniston AK, Sapey E, Lord JM, Wraith DC, Leggett E, Iles C, Marshall T, Price MJ, Marwaha S, Davies EH, Jackson LJ, Matthews KL, Camaradou J, Calvert M, Haroon S.

        "This article about the settlement of a lawsuit and COVID-19 vaccine religious exemptions was written by Dorit Rubinstein Reiss, Professor of Law at the University of California Hastings College of the Law (San Francisco, CA), who is a frequent contributor to this and many other blogs, providing in-depth, and intellectually stimulating, articles about vaccines, medical issues, social policy, and the law.\n\nProfessor Reiss writes extensively in law journals about vaccination\u2019s social and legal policies. Additionally, Reiss is also a member of the Parent Advisory Board of Voices for Vaccines, a parent-led organization that supports and advocates for on-time vaccination and the reduction of vaccine-preventable diseases. She is also a member of the Vaccines Working Group on Ethics and Policy.\n\nHeadlines about a settlement between healthcare workers and their employer related to COVID-19 vaccine religious exemptions led people to ask what is the relevance of that settlement. This post explains this settlement and puts the issue in context.\n\nThree points need to be made:\n\nFirst, this is not the first time an employer settled a claim for denial of religious exemption.\n\nSecond, sometimes the settlement is the result of an employer making mistakes in handling religious exemptions and having a really bad case, and settling is the right thing.\n\nThird, in legal terms, the settlement has no relevance to any other case. In practical terms, though, it can be used to put pressure on other employers, even when those employers are on legally solid ground.\n\nPhoto by cottonbro on Pexels.com\n\nBackground on COVID-19 vaccine religious exemption lawsuit\n\nApparently, Northshore University Healthsystem, a health system with over 17,000 employees, imposed a vaccine mandate. They allowed employees to apply for a religious exemption. Five hundred twenty-three employees had their religious exemptions denied \u2013 we do not know what the process was or why the requests were denied, though articles about the case mentioned that the workers cited the use of cell lines in vaccines \u2013 which might be an issue for these employers now, since Novavax, recently authorized for use, does not use such cell lines in their vaccine, so they now have another option.\n\nOut of those employees, Northshore \u201cestimate[d]\u201d in the settlement, about 204 got the vaccine and remained employed, and 269 were fired or resigned.\n\nFourteen of these employees filed a lawsuit claiming religious discrimination, though one of them \u2013 who had a religious exemption granted \u2013 dropped out since she has no case. The conservative organization Liberty Counsel apparently represented them. Note, that this is not an anti-vaccine group, but it is a conservative group that is willing to support claims of religious freedom. On July 29, 2022, the parties submit a settlement to the federal district court in the northern district of Illinois. I will address the settlement below, but let\u2019s start with some legal context.\n\nLegal context\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers with more than 15 employees from discriminating against employees based on, among other things, religion. If an employee has a sincere religious belief that conflicts with a workplace rule, an employer is supposed to provide a reasonable accommodation, unless it\u2019s an undue burden. There are many moving parts here, and the EEOC addressed them in detailed guidance, and I wrote about them in a shorter form before.\n\nBut for the basis of this settlement, the main issue is that an employer needs to provide an accommodation if the religious belief is sincere. In spite of what some observers wrote about this settlement, this means employers can engage in some inquiries into the sincerity of the belief. The EEOC explains:\n\nGenerally, under Title VII, an employer should proceed on the assumption that a request for religious accommodation is based on sincerely held religious beliefs, practices, or observances. However, if an employer has an objective basis for questioning either the religious nature or the sincerity of a particular belief, the employer would be justified in making a limited factual inquiry and seeking additional supporting information. An employee who fails to cooperate with an employer\u2019s reasonable requests for verification of the sincerity or religious nature of a professed belief, practice, or observance risks losing any subsequent claim that the employer improperly denied an accommodation.\n\nHowever, assessing sincerity is full of pitfalls, enough to justify multiple articles on the topic. And employers have made mistakes in this area long before COVID-19, as the cases detailed in these articles show.\n\nIn short, there are some things employers should not do, and generally, if the employer appears to be acting arbitrarily or in bad faith, employers are taking a legal risk. Employers cannot condition an exemption on a letter from a religious leader, because that discriminates against believers who are not members of organized religions.\n\nIn addition, employers cannot try and assess the rationality of the employee\u2019s belief. And employers cannot refuse an exemption just because the employee\u2019s home religion supports vaccines \u2014 e.g. refuse an exemption to a Catholic because the Pope spoke in favor of COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 because their job is not to enforce the religion\u2019s rules on the employee, just to avoid discriminating against employees whose religion may conflict with a workplace rule.\n\nAnd again, an appearance of bad faith would work against the employer, even if it does not fall into these categories. For example, when I saw this case filed, I suspected the company is likely to lose if the allegations are true because its behavior looked like bad faith. In this case, apparently, the company required people requesting a religious exemption to sign that they agree that if their exemption is denied they are resigning, and then denied all exemptions, including those they found sincere.\n\nThis looks like the company pretended to offer a religious exemption and then did not take it seriously. That looks like bad faith. The company would likely have done better, if that was its intent, to openly say they will give no religious exemption and justify that, and stand on those grounds.\n\nNot only are disputes about the way employers monitor sincerity not new, but settlements of them are not new. Before COVID-19 I blogged about several of those. Note that some of the settlements here reflect an acknowledgment of the hospital that it made mistakes in implementing religious exemptions.\n\nThis is a tricky area of law, and mistakes can happen. However, that\u2019s not always the case. Settlements can also happen when a party thinks it has a good chance of winning but the litigation costs will be too high. Settlements do not have to be accurate, and in fact, may well not be a good reflection of the merits of the case. Settlements are private agreements between the parties, and they are often opaque, as is the reasoning behind them. In fact, it is usual \u2013 though apparently not the case here \u2013 for settlements to have non-disclosure clauses covering the amount and the basis.\n\nAs a final point, remember that settlements in law are binding between the parties to them, but they are not binding beyond the parties to the settlement.\n\nPhoto by Leon Seibert on Unsplash\n\nThe Doe v Northshore University Health Settlement\n\nThe settlement of the COVID-19 vaccine lawsuit applies to all 523 members of the group that was refused religious exemptions and has three parts.\n\nFinancial \u2014 Northshore agrees to create a fund of over ten million dollars, and pay from it: https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/legal-regulatory-issues/northshore-reaches-10-3m-settlement-in-vaccine-mandate-case.html $25,000 per employee that resigned or was dismissed, if they file a claim. $3,000 per employee that got vaccinated and stayed on and files a claim. An additional $20,000 to the thirteen plaintiffs who filed the claim and did not have a religious exemption (one did, and will not be paid).\n\nIn addition, Liberty Counsel will receive $2,061,500 for \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs\u201d for the lawsuit.\n\nWork-related \u2014 Northshore agreed to allow the class members to apply for re-employment. If they apply, they will receive a religious accommodation based on their request and may be rehired (\u201cbased on individual review and determination of qualifications for the open position\u201d \u2013 this clearly also depends on finding an open position). The employee would be rehired at the same level of seniority they had when they resigned or were fired. Operational \u2014 Northshore University Healthsystem will change its exemption process, though the specific changes are unclear. The new program is attached as \u201caddendum 1\u201d to the settlement and is fairly vague.\n\nWhy did NorthShore settle? Well, we do not know. It may be that their process was sufficiently shaky that their lawyers advised that they should settle, that they cannot defend the case. It may be that their lawyers advised that even though their process is appropriate, they are facing a hostile judge and cannot win, or cannot win without extensive litigation costs. The problem in a settlement like this is that it\u2019s not quite clear.\n\nThe complaint suggests that Northshore may have acted in a way that made it vulnerable to challenge, claiming:\n\nInitially, NorthShore denied all or virtually all exemption requests it received, regardless of merit. More recently, after being confronted with the illegality of its conduct, NorthShore switched tactics from denying all of the Plaintiffs\u2019 religious exemption requests to informing them that those same requests will now be \u201dapproved\u201d in theory and name only, but NorthShore then claimed that it would suffer an \u201cundue hardship\u201d if it allowed Plaintiffs to continue in their current positions. Instead, NorthShore has informed some of the Plaintiffs that \u201cit is considering an offer of fully remote work\u201d and the remaining Plaintiffs that they \u201cwill be offered the opportunity to apply for a fully remote position.\u201d NorthShore has not actually made any such offers to any Plaintiff.\n\nThis would suggest that, like the case above, NorthShore offered a religious exemption and never seriously considered any requests \u2013 which would be an issue in a case. But this is the complaint, and we do not know what NorthShore would have said.\n\nIf the complaint is right, this settlement was likely justified \u2013 but it says nothing about other companies that did have a process to review exemptions and did make a good-faith effort to assert sincerity.\n\nWhat does this settlement mean?\n\nAnti-vaccine activists are celebrating the settlement as a large win against vaccine mandates. They\u2019re not completely wrong, but they\u2019re not quite right, either.\n\nLegally, this is not news. Companies have settled cases claiming non-compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964\u2019s requirements before. It is not legal news that a company needs to consider religious exemption requests in good faith, and that wholesale rejection can get you into legal hot water. Nor is this an actual precedent for other companies.\n\nIn fact, legally, if the complaint\u2019s allegations were right, it does not even pose a viable threat for companies that did have a set process for assessing exemptions and did examine the sincerity of religious exemption.\n\nA claim that \u201cThis settlement should also serve as a strong warning to employers across the nation that they cannot refuse to accommodate those with sincere religious objections to forced vaccination mandates,\u201d\n\nThis is technically right, but not really relevant or a barrier for employers putting in place reasonable processes to examine sincerity and is not a barrier for refusing exemptions that seem non-sincere. And the existence of Novavax is going to make exemptions alleging the use of cell lines descended from fetal cells in mRNA vaccines (distant and weak as such use is, and bad an argument as it is even in that context a lot less relevant.\n\nThe problem is that hospitals may not notice these nuances and scared by the headlines, may conclude that they cannot police religious exemptions \u2013 something that this settlement does not mean. NorthShore itself practically agreed in the settlement to accept all exemption requests of the resigning or dismissed workers, even though with Novavax, their claims lose powers. On the plus side, 269 employees out of 17,000 are a trivial number, and not likely to have a huge effect. On the other hand, what happens when the next booster is due? The hospital does not have to automatically accept religious exemptions going forward but may hesitate to reject them.\n\nIf the hospital\u2019s policy was blanket refusal after purporting to give a religious exemption, settling was likely the right choice; the hospital was unlikely to win its case. But this can be misused to intimidate others, including hospitals with better policies, and that\u2019s a concern.\n\n________________________________________________Please comment below, positive or negative.

I will address the settlement below, but let\u2019s start with some legal context.\n\nLegal context\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers with more than 15 employees from discriminating against employees based on, among other things, religion. If an employee has a sincere religious belief that conflicts with a workplace rule, an employer is supposed to provide a reasonable accommodation, unless it\u2019s an undue burden. There are many moving parts here, and the EEOC addressed them in detailed guidance, and I wrote about them in a shorter form before.\n\nBut for the basis of this settlement, the main issue is that an employer needs to provide an accommodation if the religious belief is sincere. In spite of what some observers wrote about this settlement, this means employers can engage in some inquiries into the sincerity of the belief. The EEOC explains:\n\nGenerally, under Title VII, an employer should proceed on the assumption that a request for religious accommodation is based on sincerely held religious beliefs, practices, or observances. However, if an employer has an objective basis for questioning either the religious nature or the sincerity of a particular belief, the employer would be justified in making a limited factual inquiry and seeking additional supporting information. An employee who fails to cooperate with an employer\u2019s reasonable requests for verification of the sincerity or religious nature of a professed belief, practice, or observance risks losing any subsequent claim that the employer improperly denied an accommodation.\n\nHowever, assessing sincerity is full of pitfalls, enough to justify multiple articles on the topic. And employers have made mistakes in this area long before COVID-19, as the cases detailed in these articles show.\n\nIn short, there are some things employers should not do, and generally, if the employer appears to be acting arbitrarily or in bad faith, employers are taking a legal risk. Employers cannot condition an exemption on a letter from a religious leader, because that discriminates against believers who are not members of organized religions.\n\nIn addition, employers cannot try and assess the rationality of the employee\u2019s belief. And employers cannot refuse an exemption just because the employee\u2019s home religion supports vaccines \u2014 e.g. refuse an exemption to a Catholic because the Pope spoke in favor of COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 because their job is not to enforce the religion\u2019s rules on the employee, just to avoid discriminating against employees whose religion may conflict with a workplace rule.\n\nAnd again, an appearance of bad faith would work against the employer, even if it does not fall into these categories. For example, when I saw this case filed, I suspected the company is likely to lose if the allegations are true because its behavior looked like bad faith. In this case, apparently, the company required people requesting a religious exemption to sign that they agree that if their exemption is denied they are resigning, and then denied all exemptions, including those they found sincere.\n\nThis looks like the company pretended to offer a religious exemption and then did not take it seriously. That looks like bad faith. The company would likely have done better, if that was its intent, to openly say they will give no religious exemption and justify that, and stand on those grounds.\n\nNot only are disputes about the way employers monitor sincerity not new, but settlements of them are not new. Before COVID-19 I blogged about several of those. Note that some of the settlements here reflect an acknowledgment of the hospital that it made mistakes in implementing religious exemptions.\n\nThis is a tricky area of law, and mistakes can happen. However, that\u2019s not always the case. Settlements can also happen when a party thinks it has a good chance of winning but the litigation costs will be too high. Settlements do not have to be accurate, and in fact, may well not be a good reflection of the merits of the case. Settlements are private agreements between the parties, and they are often opaque, as is the reasoning behind them. In fact, it is usual \u2013 though apparently not the case here \u2013 for settlements to have non-disclosure clauses covering the amount and the basis.\n\nAs a final point, remember that settlements in law are binding between the parties to them, but they are not binding beyond the parties to the settlement.\n\nPhoto by Leon Seibert on Unsplash\n\nThe Doe v Northshore University Health Settlement\n\nThe settlement of the COVID-19 vaccine lawsuit applies to all 523 members of the group that was refused religious exemptions and has three parts.\n\nFinancial \u2014 Northshore agrees to create a fund of over ten million dollars, and pay from it: https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/legal-regulatory-issues/northshore-reaches-10-3m-settlement-in-vaccine-mandate-case.html $25,000 per employee that resigned or was dismissed, if they file a claim. $3,000 per employee that got vaccinated and stayed on and files a claim. An additional $20,000 to the thirteen plaintiffs who filed the claim and did not have a religious exemption (one did, and will not be paid).\n\nIn addition, Liberty Counsel will receive $2,061,500 for \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs\u201d for the lawsuit.\n\nWork-related \u2014 Northshore agreed to allow the class members to apply for re-employment. If they apply, they will receive a religious accommodation based on their request and may be rehired (\u201cbased on individual review and determination of qualifications for the open position\u201d \u2013 this clearly also depends on finding an open position). The employee would be rehired at the same level of seniority they had when they resigned or were fired. Operational \u2014 Northshore University Healthsystem will change its exemption process, though the specific changes are unclear. The new program is attached as \u201caddendum 1\u201d to the settlement and is fairly vague.\n\nWhy did NorthShore settle? Well, we do not know. It may be that their process was sufficiently shaky that their lawyers advised that they should settle, that they cannot defend the case. It may be that their lawyers advised that even though their process is appropriate, they are facing a hostile judge and cannot win, or cannot win without extensive litigation costs. The problem in a settlement like this is that it\u2019s not quite clear.\n\nThe complaint suggests that Northshore may have acted in a way that made it vulnerable to challenge, claiming:\n\nInitially, NorthShore denied all or virtually all exemption requests it received, regardless of merit. More recently, after being confronted with the illegality of its conduct, NorthShore switched tactics from denying all of the Plaintiffs\u2019 religious exemption requests to informing them that those same requests will now be \u201dapproved\u201d in theory and name only, but NorthShore then claimed that it would suffer an \u201cundue hardship\u201d if it allowed Plaintiffs to continue in their current positions. Instead, NorthShore has informed some of the Plaintiffs that \u201cit is considering an offer of fully remote work\u201d and the remaining Plaintiffs that they \u201cwill be offered the opportunity to apply for a fully remote position.\u201d NorthShore has not actually made any such offers to any Plaintiff.\n\nThis would suggest that, like the case above, NorthShore offered a religious exemption and never seriously considered any requests \u2013 which would be an issue in a case. But this is the complaint, and we do not know what NorthShore would have said.\n\nIf the complaint is right, this settlement was likely justified \u2013 but it says nothing about other companies that did have a process to review exemptions and did make a good-faith effort to assert sincerity.\n\nWhat does this settlement mean?\n\nAnti-vaccine activists are celebrating the settlement as a large win against vaccine mandates. They\u2019re not completely wrong, but they\u2019re not quite right, either.\n\nLegally, this is not news. Companies have settled cases claiming non-compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964\u2019s requirements before. It is not legal news that a company needs to consider religious exemption requests in good faith, and that wholesale rejection can get you into legal hot water. Nor is this an actual precedent for other companies.\n\nIn fact, legally, if the complaint\u2019s allegations were right, it does not even pose a viable threat for companies that did have a set process for assessing exemptions and did examine the sincerity of religious exemption.\n\nA claim that \u201cThis settlement should also serve as a strong warning to employers across the nation that they cannot refuse to accommodate those with sincere religious objections to forced vaccination mandates,\u201d\n\nThis is technically right, but not really relevant or a barrier for employers putting in place reasonable processes to examine sincerity and is not a barrier for refusing exemptions that seem non-sincere. And the existence of Novavax is going to make exemptions alleging the use of cell lines descended from fetal cells in mRNA vaccines (distant and weak as such use is, and bad an argument as it is even in that context a lot less relevant.\n\nThe problem is that hospitals may not notice these nuances and scared by the headlines, may conclude that they cannot police religious exemptions \u2013 something that this settlement does not mean. NorthShore itself practically agreed in the settlement to accept all exemption requests of the resigning or dismissed workers, even though with Novavax, their claims lose powers. On the plus side, 269 employees out of 17,000 are a trivial number, and not likely to have a huge effect. On the other hand, what happens when the next booster is due? The hospital does not have to automatically accept religious exemptions going forward but may hesitate to reject them.\n\nIf the hospital\u2019s policy was blanket refusal after purporting to give a religious exemption, settling was likely the right choice; the hospital was unlikely to win its case. But this can be misused to intimidate others, including hospitals with better policies, and that\u2019s a concern.\n\n________________________________________________Please comment below, positive or negative.

        "Complete vaccination against COVID-19 was linked to a reduced risk of cardiovascular events such as acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke as secondary complications of a COVID-19 infection. These results were published in a peer-reviewed journal recently.\n\nThis is another huge benefit of COVID-19 vaccination that should be convincing evidence that the vaccine has both short- and long-term benefits.\n\nAs I usually do, I will review the study and results so that you can use this paper as further evidence that COVID-19 vaccination saves lives.\n\nPhoto by Jair L\u00e1zaro on Unsplash\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination and reduced cardiovascular risks paper\n\nIn a research letter published on 22 July 2022 in JAMA, Jaehun Jung, MD, Ph.D., of Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea, and colleagues examined cardiovascular events in the 31 to 120 days after COVID-19 diagnosis for the fully vaccinated compared with those not vaccinated. Jung and colleagues compared COVID-19 patients who were never vaccinated (n=62,727) to those who were fully vaccinated (n=168,310). They used nationwide data Korean nationwide COVID-19 registry and the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. COVID-19-19 reporting is mandated and universal health care coverage is in place in Korea.\n\nThe key results were:\n\nComposite of hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke \u2014 adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 0.42, or a 58% reduction in risk for COVID-19 vaccinated versus unvaccinated.\n\nAcute myocardial infarction \u2014 adjusted HR = 0.48, or a 52% reduction in risk.\n\nIschemic stroke \u2014 adjusted HR = 0.40, or a 60% reduction in risk\n\nThe reduction in post-COVID myocardial infarctions and strokes among the fully vaccinated was observed across various subgroups. However, it did not reach statistical significance for people with a previous history of outcome events or those with severe or critical COVID-19.\n\nThese results are not different than another study that I previously discussed. Using data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs before widespread vaccine availability, the researchers had estimated strokes from 30 days after infection as occurring at a rate of 4.03 per 1,000 people at 12 months; post-COVID myocardial infarctions were reported at 2.91 per 1,000 people at 12 months.\n\nIn the Korean data, the stroke rate in unvaccinated individuals was 4.59 per million person-days and the myocardial infarction rate was 1.60 per million person-days in the 31 to 120 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\n\nSummary\n\nOnce again, there is robust and repeated evidence that the risk of long-term consequences of COVID-19 is reduced by COVID-19 vaccination. These vaccines are safe and effective, and they prevent cardiovascular events from COVID-19 such as heart attack and stroke. If this doesn\u2019t convince you to get the vaccine, I\u2019m running out of ideas.\n\nGet the vaccine, it saves your life.\n\nCitations\n\n________________________________________________Please comment below, positive or negative.

        "Across the internet, I keep reading about some relationships between vitamin D levels and COVID-19. I\u2019ve written about it twice (here and here), but I have never seen reliable, robust, and repeated clinical trial data that supports a link between vitamin D levels or deficiencies and COVID-19.\n\nSo, I thought I would take a look at it once again, and see if there\u2019s anything there. I keep wondering if vitamin D is just another \u201cmiracle supplement\u201d that, once you scratch the surface of data, you find that there is actually nothing there.\n\nWhat we know or think we know about COVID-19 seems to change daily, partially because the disease caught us by surprise. But every day we seem to get new data that contradicts something we thought or adds to our knowledge of the disease. And sometimes both.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the current data on vitamin D and COVID-19.\n\nPhoto by ready made on Pexels.com\n\nWhat is vitamin D?\n\nVitamin D is a group of fat-soluble secosteroids (it\u2019s a scientific name for steroids with a \u201cbroken\u201d ring). The most important chemicals in this group are vitamin D 3 (known as cholecalciferol) and D 2 (known as ergocalciferol).\n\nGenerally, when we measure vitamin D levels in the blood, we measure calcifediol (also written as 25(OH)D), which is a form of vitamin D produced in the liver by the hydroxylation of vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) by the enzyme vitamin D 25-hydroxylase.\n\nVery few foods contain either of the important types of vitamin D. However, some foods can be good sources of the vitamin:\n\nFatty fish, like tuna, mackerel, and salmon\n\nFoods fortified with vitamin D, like some dairy products, orange juice, soy milk, and cereals\n\nBeef liver\n\nCheese\n\nEgg yolks\n\nMany people with broad diets that include a lot of fish, eggs, and other foods can get sufficient vitamin D without supplementation. As I\u2019ve repeated often, short of chronic malnutrition, we get plenty of vitamin D.\n\nMoreover, vitamin D is produced by a process called dermal synthesis. That is, sunlight, specifically UV-B radiation, causes the synthesis of vitamin D in the skin. Technically, vitamin D isn\u2019t a vitamin, because we can manufacture it, it is a hormone. For this article, we\u2019ll just call it a vitamin, even though scientifically it is not.\n\nAlthough we can manufacture sufficient vitamin D by sunbathing every day, the body has a feedback loop that shuts down production to prevent toxicity. Yes, excess vitamin D is quite dangerous leading to many conditions such as over-absorption of calcium, from hypertension to fatigue. But it also can lead to some dangerous chronic conditions that we\u2019ll discuss later.\n\nAlthough humans can manufacture vitamin D by sitting in bright sun, there\u2019s one major problem \u2013 the risk of skin cancer. As I\u2019ve written before, there are very few ways to prevent cancer, but staying out of the sun is one of them.\n\nFinally, the vitamin D we consume or produce in sunlight is not biologically active. It is generally activated by enzymatic conversion (in a process called hydroxylation) in the kidneys and liver so that the body can use it.\n\nWhat does vitamin D do or don\u2019t do?\n\nBased on real scientific evidence, vitamin D has a very narrow, but important, set of effects.\n\nFirst, it is responsible for enhancing intestinal absorption of calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphate, and zinc, important minerals for the continued health of any human being. Many of these minerals (and vitamin D itself) are necessary for good bone health.\n\nSecond, since vitamin D is important to calcium homeostasis and metabolism, a deficiency of the vitamin results in rickets, or the adult form of the disease, osteomalacia. Rickets, because it happens in immature bones, leads to frequent fractures and skeletal deformities. Osteomalacia, because it occurs in adults with fully formed bones, usually only results in numerous fractures.\n\nAt this point, that\u2019s it. Robust evidence only supports those two physiological effects.\n\nHowever, here are a few claims made by the supplement-pushing crowd:\n\nDespite this utter lack of evidence, vitamin D has continued to be the panacea for all that ails humans. For those of us who only care about large, high-quality, peer-reviewed studies, vitamin D is overrated, unless you need to prevent rickets.\n\nPhoto by Pixabay on Pexels.com\n\nVitamin D and COVID-19 \u2014 clinical evidence\n\nAfter over two years of this pandemic, I assumed that there would be a lot of clinical evidence that would be published on the links (or lack thereof) between vitamin D levels and COVID-19. I am not going to review every single clinical trial that\u2019s been published because that would take forever. I\u2019m going to focus on high-quality studies (specifically systematic reviews or meta-analyses, which are at the top of the hierarchy of medical research) if any are available.\n\nIn a systematic review published in June 2021, the researchers examined 31 peer-reviewed observational studies that examined potential links between COVID-19 and vitamin D. There results did not find any statistically significant associations between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 outcomes. Many of the studies were of poor design or poor quality.\n\nThe authors concluded:\n\nWhile the available evidence to-date, from largely poor-quality observational studies, may be viewed as showing a trend for an association between low serum 25(OH)D levels and COVID-19 related health outcomes, this relationship was not found to be statistically significant. Calcifediol supplementation may have a protective effect on COVID-19 related ICU admissions. The current use of high doses of vitamin D in COVID-19 patients is not based on solid evidence. It awaits results from ongoing trials to determine the efficacy, desirable doses, and safety, of vitamin D supplementation to prevent and treat COVID-19 related health outcomes.\n\nAnother systematic review, published on 28 June 2021, showed a similar lack of association between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 outcomes. They examined five studies, which included a total of 467 patients (an incredibly small number), vitamin D levels were not linked to reduced mortality, reduced ICU admissions, and reduced requirements for ventilation.\n\nThe authors concluded:\n\nNo significant difference with vitamin-D supplementation on major health related outcomes in COVID-19. Well-designed RCTs are required addressing this topic.\n\nIn a meta-analysis published on 10 October 2020, the researchers were a bit more enthusiastic about vitamin D and COVID-19. The researchers analyzed six clinical studies. They found that patients with significantly lower serum levels of vitamin D had statistically higher risks of poorer COVID-19 outcomes.\n\nThe authors concluded that:\n\nSerum vitamin D levels could be implicated in the COVID-19 prognosis. Diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency could be a helpful adjunct in assessing patients\u2019 potential of developing severe COVID-19. Appropriate preventative and/or therapeutic intervention may improve COVID-19 outcomes.\n\nIn a meta-analysis published on 19 May 2021, researchers examined results from 532 patients in three separate studies. There appeared to be a statistically lower ICU requirement in those who received vitamin D supplementation compared to those that didn\u2019t.\n\nIn one more meta-analysis published on 23 September 2021, the researchers examined 21 studies that were found to be relevant to the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19 infection/outcomes. This included 205,869 total patients. I would consider this to be the most robust of the meta-analyses and systematic reviews that I have examined.\n\nThe results of this meta-analysis were:\n\nIndividuals with low serum vitamin D levels were 1.64X more likely to contract COVID-19.\n\nwere 1.64X more likely to contract COVID-19. The researchers found that people with serum 25(OH)D levels below 20 ng/mL or 50 nmol/L were 2.42X more likely to have severe COVID-19.\n\nHowever, the researchers found that low vitamin D levels did not affect COVID-19 mortality.\n\nSummary\n\nSo what are our takeaways from all of this data?\n\nIt\u2019s a bit all over the place, though the final meta-analysis I reviewed seemed to provide good (but not great) evidence that supports the hypothesis that lower blood vitamin D levels may lead to worse outcomes from COVID-19.\n\nBut that leads to two important claims made about vitamin D:\n\nThere is no evidence vitamin D can prevent COVID-19 except when used as a supplement when someone has a known vitamin D deficiency. Megadoses of vitamin D can be dangerous and do not improve COVID-19 outcomes.\n\nAnd we don\u2019t know why low vitamin D levels are linked to worse COVID-19 outcomes. It could be that individuals with low vitamin D levels have a lower immune response compared to those with normal vitamin D levels. And no, this does not mean that more vitamin D is going to miraculously boost your immune system so that COVID-19 will never strike. Get that out of your thinking immediately, because none of this evidence supports such a claim.\n\nAnd one more thing \u2014 we have zero evidence regarding vitamin D levels and outcomes from the new omicron variants. Maybe it\u2019s the same as COVID-19 in general, or maybe there\u2019s a difference. We will see.\n\nCitations\n\n________________________________________________Please comment below, positive or negative. Of course, if you find spelling errors, tell me!

And no, this does not mean that more vitamin D is going to miraculously boost your immune system so that COVID-19 will never strike. Get that out of your thinking immediately, because none of this evidence supports such a claim.\n\nAnd one more thing \u2014 we have zero evidence regarding vitamin D levels and outcomes from the new omicron variants. Maybe it\u2019s the same as COVID-19 in general, or maybe there\u2019s a difference. We will see.\n\nCitations\n\n________________________________________________Please comment below, positive or negative. Of course, if you find spelling errors, tell me!

        "COVID changed our world forever\u2014no one will forget the profound effect this modern pandemic has had on our everyday lives. Thankfully, we finally see the end of the pandemic, thanks in large part to the biotechnology industry. Without its immediate and tireless work to figure out what COVID-19 was, to develop therapeutics to treat it, and to finally find a way to protect against it with several vaccines, we might still be in dire straits today.\n\nBiotech definitively changed COVID, but did the virus change our industry? Today, we speak with experts about the lasting effect the pandemic has had on biotech and what changes we expect to see permanently.\n\nThe transmission and spread of COVID highlighted how intricately everything on the planet is connected\u2014the concept of \u201cOne Health.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe real basics behind the One Health concept is that the health of people, the health of animals, and the health of our environment are inextricably linked. So, changes in one affect the others,\u201d explains Dr. William Karesh, Executive Vice President for Health and Policy at the Echo Health Alliance. \u201cOne Health brings that together \u2013 rather than saying that human health and animal health, environmental health are separate and can be addressed separately, they can\u2019t be addressed separately because they interact so much.\u201d\n\nWith that idea of connection and oneness comes a natural need for collaboration, which we saw first-hand in the fight against COVID-19. Cartier Esham, BIO\u2019s Chief Scientific Officer, says \u201ccompanies jumped in because they wanted to help solve the global crisis\u2026It was their challenge to meet; and they did so.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd we are thankful they did.\n\nIt was truly an all-hands-on deck approach. Companies in the space pivoted from research projects to help. Aaron Sato, Chief Scientific Officer of Twist Bioscience, said that the company was able to provide scientific researchers at other biotech companies with synthetic versions of the virus to study which minimized their exposure risk. Helping other companies was not a fiscal decision, but a moral one.\n\nBecause of this collaboration for the public good, public opinion of the biotech industry has drastically improved. Ron Foshay of Service Research Insights says \u201cthe extraordinary effort made to develop safe and effective vaccines, one survey reported, shows that positive ratings of pharmaceutical companies went from 32% in early 2020 to 62% in early 2021. That\u2019s a really big jump.\u201d\n\nCollaboration and improved public opinion weren\u2019t the only good outcomes to come from battling COVID-19. Karesh highlights another \u2013 greater public understanding of the industry and clinical testing as a whole. And Esham hopes that the COVID-era change in clinical testing practices of bringing trials to patients will have a profound and beneficial impact on clinical trials of the future.\n\nBiotechnology has always been home to rapidly changing science, but COVID-19 fundamentally reshaped tenets of the industry in a way that will likely benefit more people.\n\nListen to the entire episode here.\n\nThis episode is sponsored by FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies."

        "Throughout 2021, there was a great deal of advances in the biotechnology sector in the United States \u2013 thanks, in part, to state-led and regional economic development initiatives which have created jobs, advanced educational opportunities, and championed innovation.\n\nAccording to the recently published report by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) and the Council of State Bioscience Associations (CSBA), \u201cDriving the Bioscience Economy Forward During the COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d, state and regional initiatives ensured that the United States continues to be competitive in the global marketplace as a leader in the bioscience industry.\n\nThe purpose of the report is \u201cto help our partners out there \u2026 understand how we are a part of the larger ecosystem in a growing number of states,\u201d said Pete Pellerito, Senior Policy Adviser for Federal/State Economic Development & Technology Transfer Lead at BIO. \u201cThis report really reinforces the depth and the diversity of our geographic footprint in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can build all the new buildings we want, we can bring all the new equipment we want, have all the intellectual property in place, but if we don\u2019t have the people to drive it \u2026 [all] forward, any state, any region, is going to be at a disadvantage,\u201d Pellerito continued.\n\nUltimately, the U.S. bioscience industry employs 1.87 million people across more than 101,000 U.S. businesses.\n\nHere are just a few examples of how states are driving the bioscience economy.\n\nBiomanufacturing\n\nBiomanufacturing is a type of manufacturing that leverages biological systems for the production of commercially vital biomolecules and biomaterials for medicines, food, and beverage processing as well as industrial use. State-level measures noted in the report to advance biomanufacturing include Ohio\u2019s Advanced Manufacturing Initiative, which is a competitive grant program to encourage new advanced manufacturing project and service activity.\n\nIn North Carolina, the state\u2019s Golden LEAF Biomanufacturing Training and Education Center (BTEC) provides hands-on education and training both in biomanufacturing methods as well as bioprocessing concepts. This training and education is in full compliance with cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practice), a set of regulations published by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Additionally, North Carolina provides both Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) state matching grants as well as a manufacturing sales tax exemption on equipment.\n\nMeanwhile, Connecticut has a Manufacturing Innovation Fund that offers worker training and apprenticeship programs, loans, grants, and vouchers. In addition, the state is aiming to support the creation of at least 15,000 new jobs over the next five years in advanced manufacturing, data science, and insurance technology.\n\nThe importance of public-private partnership\n\nPublic-private partnerships will continue to be key to the development of the bioscience industry in the United States.\n\nIn Massachusetts, Harvard and MIT came together in 2021 to start building a 40,000 square foot facility to create partnerships between the biopharmaceutical sector, academia, and medical leaders to advance the development of new treatment technologies for patients. The state government of Massachusetts is involved in this effort through the Massachusetts Life Science Center.\n\nOver in Tennessee, the state has directed $2.5 million of the state\u2019s budget during the 2021-2022 fiscal year towards the development of public-private partnerships to develop animal health drug products by working with universities, which have strong veterinary medicine and agricultural programs that study animal dermatological conditions and cancers.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for the bioscience industry?\n\nAs the 2022 elections are approaching, Pellerito stated \u201cI have never felt that support for our industry has been partisan. I think it\u2019s very bipartisan.\u201d\n\nNo matter what the political winds have in store later this year, the biotech sector will continue to play an integral role in job creation and innovation across different states and regions, he said.\n\nWhen asked regarding what efforts are being made to advance opportunities for members of historically underrepresented communities across different states and regions, Pellerito pointed to BIO\u2019s BIOEquality Agenda, stating that increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the bioscience industry is of the utmost importance both to BIO members as well as to various academic partners.\n\nAs the report makes clear, despite the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, the bioscience industry is in a strong position for continued growth. Ultimately, the success of the industry is dependent upon maintaining and expanding existing partnerships, all while creating new ones to further advance the opportunities that it provides in the communities it collaborates with and serves.",
        "It\u2019s been two years since COVID-19 was officially named a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), and it seems we are finally on the edge of moving from a pandemic to an endemic.\n\nBut what does this mean\u2014and what lessons can we take with us as we think about COVID-19 staying with us, or perhaps the next pandemic that may come sooner than we\u2019d like?\n\n\u201cYear 2 showed us that there's some durability to these vaccines,\u201d said Phyllis Arthur, BIO\u2019s Vice President of Infectious Diseases & Emerging Science. \u201cYear 2 showed us that we can vaccinate at younger ages, and we found that heterologous boosting could actually lead to very interesting duration protection, which is a powerful thing scientifically.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother thing we learned in Year 2 was the power of activating messengers to talk to their specific community about vaccination is incredibly important and that that is what we need to be doing across all kinds of health care,\u201d continued Arthur. \u201cThe lack of understanding also opened the window for those who are anti-vaccine to actually take advantage of those misgivings. And people spread misinformation in communities that they weren't even a part of.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the biggest vaccination campaign in American history\u2014but not everyone\u2019s on board. New #IamBIO Podcast episode features the voices of vaccine hesitancy and leaders building vaccine confidence, featuring @DrReedTuckson of the @BCAgainstCOVID. Listen: https://t.co/ckDrxBcU7R pic.twitter.com/OGqsUDZ7UQ \u2014 I Am Biotech (@IAmBiotech) April 20, 2021\n\n\u201cWhat does the end of the pandemic look like?\u201d asked Arthur. \u201cFor me, it's the stabilization of the incidence of disease and prevalence of the strains. That change is coming [\u2026] If you can literally, generally manage the number of people who are ill and hospitalized with existing medicine and have relatively controlled, or no, breakthroughs amongst people who are vaccinated, then we are kind of where the flu is.\u201d\n\nBut it is important to plan for the next pandemic now. \u201cEverybody wants to get on with the rest of their lives, and this is fine for the American people,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut the legislators and the administration needs to actually take the moment to step back and look at this and ask, what are the systems and safeguards I need to keep?\u201d\n\nWhy IP protection is critical to pandemic preparedness\n\nThe proposed waiver of IP for COVID vaccine technology could counteract future pandemic preparedness. While some have argued a waiver of the WTO Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement would facilitate COVID-19 vaccine development and distribution, the exact opposite is true, experts told us.\n\nWe\u2019ll say it again: Waiving IP rights would compromise global vaccination efforts. \u201cThey argue that eliminating IP protections would allow any willing company to produce lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines, making them cheaper and more widely accessible in low-income nations,\u201d BIO\u2019s Dr. Michelle McMurry-Heath responded succinctly. \u201cIf true, that would be a compelling argument. But it isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe problem with access is not so cut and dry, BIO\u2019s Senior Manager of International Affairs, Hillary Stiss, explains: \u201cIt is not an issue of IP that is preventing people from getting vaccines particularly in Africa. Really it is issues around African healthcare systems not being able to absorb vaccines and deliver it into arms.\u201d\n\nAs Hans Sauer, BIO\u2019s Deputy General Counsel and Vice President for Intellectual Property, further explained, there have been over 30 COVID vaccines developed\u2014not just the Pfizer, Modern, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines\u2014apparently without interference by anyone's patent rights. So, the idea that patents are getting in the way is incorrect.\n\nYet the very arguments used by governments to waive COVID IP rights seem to be a red herring to deflect from problematic global north government policy, while simultaneously disrespecting the work done by the private sector to step up and address this pandemic in record time \u2013 all with the added risk of disrupting investment, as well as R&D within biotech companies that would do absolutely nothing to help safeguard against the next big pandemic.\n\n\u201cThere are certain folks who are willing to trade the next decades\u2019 innovation for access today as opposed to thinking of ways to manage access in a way that doesn't trade future innovation,\u201d noted Arthur.\n\n\u201cYou don't sell the rug out from under companies in order to do that,\u201d she continued. \u201cCompanies' memories are actually quite long and if we have another pandemic and ask companies to help after forcing them to share their trade secrets they are going to resist.\n\nBiotech's Response to COVID-19, 2020-2022 Timeline\n\nYear 1",
        "Analysis of \"We'll Have Herd Immunity by April\" Published in Wall Street Journal , by Marty Makary on\n\nThree scientists analysed the article and estimate its overall scientific credibility to be very low. more about the credibility rating\n\nA majority of reviewers tagged the article as: Cherry picking, Misleading, Overstates scientific confidence.\n\n2.2k SHARES Share Tweet\n\nSCIENTISTS\u2019 FEEDBACK\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThis Wall Street Journal opinion piece, published on 18 February 2021, claimed in its headline that the U.S. will \u201chave herd immunity by April\u201d. Written by Marty Makary, a professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, the article received more than 220,000 interactions and 37,000 shares on Facebook, according to the social media analytics tool CrowdTangle. Its claim was also propagated through social media posts by other outlets, such as this video by former U.S. Representative Ron Paul and this article by Zero Hedge, labeled a \u201cconspiracy-pseudoscience\u201d source by Media Bias/Fact Check.\n\nHerd immunity is a state in which a certain proportion of individuals in a population are immune to an infectious disease. As explained in this article by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health:\n\n\u201cFor example, if 80% of a population is immune to a virus, four out of every five people who encounter someone with the disease won\u2019t get sick (and won\u2019t spread the disease any further). In this way, the spread of infectious diseases is kept under control. Depending how contagious an infection is, usually 50% to 90% of a population needs immunity to achieve herd immunity.\u201d\n\nThe headline\u2019s claim is built in large part on the assumption that \u201c55% of Americans have natural immunity\u201d to COVID-19 through prior infection. However, experts who reviewed the article told Health Feedback that this assumption wasn\u2019t supported by the data. [See our reviewers\u2019 overall feedback.]\n\nMarm Kilpatrick, a professor at the University of California Santa Cruz who studies disease ecology, found that the article\u2019s figures for the number of COVID-19 infections detected by testing, as well as the infection fatality rate\u2014which measures the proportion of infected people who die from the disease\u2014were unsubstantiated.\n\nKilpatrick explained that the proportion of COVID-19 infections detected by testing is unknown, since there are no representative serosurveys available for the U.S. Serosurveys, or seroprevalence studies, measure the proportion of people who have antibodies to a pathogen. These studies inform researchers about the extent of a pathogen\u2019s spread in a population.\n\n\u201cThe author uses a value of 15.4 percent (1/6.5), which produces a very different answer than if the author had used his other proposed value of 25 percent (1/4),\u201d Kirkpatrick pointed out. \u201cInstead of the 55 percent seroprevalence claimed, seroprevalence would be 34 percent. The fraction of infections detected by testing may even be higher than 25 percent, which would produce an even lower estimate of seroprevalence.\u201d\n\nThe article also extrapolated the total number of COVID-19 infections by relying on the infection fatality rate and the total number of deaths. However, the article underestimated the infection fatality rate. Given a fixed number of deaths, the higher the infection fatality rate, the smaller the size of the infected population.\n\n\u201cThe best available data for the U.S. population indicates a value of 0.6,\u201d Kilpatrick said, citing a study by O\u2019Driscoll et al.[1]. \u201cUsing the same number of deaths as the author\u201d, which is 0.15 percent of the U.S. population, this would translate to 25 percent of the U.S. population having been infected, \u201crather than two-thirds as the author claimed.\u201d\n\nIn short, the article\u2019s statement that \u201c55 \u2013 66 percent of the U.S. population has already been infected and has immunity is not supported by available data,\u201d he concluded.\n\nApart from the miscalculations in the total number of infections, the article also made several inaccurate assertions about COVID-19 reinfections and immunity.\n\nTara Smith, an epidemiologist and professor at Kent State University, refuted the article\u2019s claim that \u201cwhen [reinfections] do occur, the cases are mild\u201d, citing a case report documenting COVID-19 cases around the world that were more serious upon reinfection[2].\n\nVirologist Angela Rasmussen pointed out that the article misrepresented a study by Sekine et al. on T cells[3]: \u201cT cell immunity is presented [in the Wall Street Journal opinion piece] as being an indicator of protective immunity [\u2026] this is an incorrect interpretation of the data cited about T cells to support that assertion\u201d.\n\nEric Topol, a cardiologist and professor of molecular medicine at the Scripps Research Institute, highlighted several problems with the opinion piece in a Twitter thread:\n\nNo, we won't. A deeply flawed oped https://t.co/xkAQKU1hg6\n\n\u201455% of Americans do not have natural immunity\n\n\u20142/3 of the US population has not had covid\n\n\u2014Wrong on T-cell protection\n\n\u2014Very high Brazil infection rate was not protective\n\n\u2014150M will not be vaccinated by March end pic.twitter.com/NLGVnUJv2Y \u2014 Eric Topol (@EricTopol) February 18, 2021\n\nWilliam Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, pointed out that the article\u2019s use of the Brazilian city of Manaus as a real-life example of successful protection through natural infection is inaccurate and misleading.\n\n\u201cThe article fails to mention that since the research it cites was published, Manaus has suffered a surge of infections even worse than the one that it saw at the start of the pandemic[4],\u201d he said.\n\nAs reported in a study by Buss et al.[5], even though an estimated 76 percent of Manaus\u2019 population was infected, the spread of COVID-19 wasn\u2019t halted. In fact, news reports indicated that a second wave of infections overwhelmed hospitals in early 2021. Buss et al. warned that \u201cManaus represents a \u2018sentinel\u2019 population, giving us a data-based indication of what may happen if SARS-CoV-2 is allowed to spread largely unmitigated.\u201d\n\nCuriously, the Lancet commentary cited in the opinion piece to support the claim actually reported COVID-19 resurgence in Manaus despite the high level of infection in its population[4]. This contradicts the Wall Street Journal article\u2019s suggestion that Manaus had achieved protection through natural infection.\n\nOne reason for the resurgence may be the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants[4,6], although other factors, such as waning population immunity, may also be a contributing factor.\n\n\u201cIt is not known to what extent the circulating variant P.1 contributed to the surge, or how many cases were reinfections, but it should be more than enough to demonstrate the dangers of trusting to \u2018herd immunity\u2019 from infection for protection,\u201d Hanage said.\n\nCases in the U.S. have indeed been falling in recent weeks. The reason for this is still unclear, but this Washington Post article explored several possible explanations. Apart from vaccinations, other potential contributing factors that scientists highlighted were changes in people\u2019s behavior, such as greater adherence to physical distancing and the use of face masks, as well as fewer COVID-19 tests being performed due to a shift in focus from testing to vaccinating. However, an analysis of the number of cases and positivity rate in this Health Feedback review indicated that the decrease is genuine and not simply due to fewer tests being performed.\n\nIn summary, the Wall Street Journal opinion piece\u2019s claim that the U.S. will achieve herd immunity by April 2021 is unsupported by the available data. Its claim that natural infection confers sufficient herd immunity to end the COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S. also doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny, when we consider the example of Manaus. The city experienced a largely uncontrolled spread of COVID-19, which resulted in a high infection rate. Yet the city still saw a resurgence of COVID-19 that was worse than the first wave.\n\nWhile the U.S. is indeed experiencing a fall in the number of new COVID-19 cases, scientists have urged Americans to avoid complacency given the threat posed by the new virus variants.\n\nMasks, distancing, ventilation, avoiding gatherings, getting vaccinated when eligible. These are the tools we have to continue the long trip down the tall mountain. The variants may throw us a curve ball, but if we keep driving down transmission we can get to a better place. 7/7 \u2014 Caitlin Rivers, PhD (@cmyeaton) February 4, 2021\n\nFormer director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tom Frieden told CNN:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had three surges. Whether or not we have a fourth surge is up to us, and the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher.\u201d\n\nYou can read the original Wall Street Journal article here.\n\n\n\nSCIENTISTS\u2019 OVERALL FEEDBACK\n\nA. Marm Kilpatrick, Professor, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California Santa Cruz:\n\nThe article\u2019s claim that the U.S. is near herd immunity rests on two numbers: 1) the detection of infections by testing (claimed to be 10 \u2013 25 percent) and 2) the infection fatality rate (claimed to be 0.23 percent).\n\n1) The fraction of infections detected by testing is unknown, as there are no representative serosurveys for the U.S. on which to quantify this number. The author uses a value of 15.4 percent (1/6.5), which produces a very different answer than if the author had used his other proposed value of 25 percent (1/4). Instead of the 55 percent seroprevalence claimed, seroprevalence would be 34 percent. The fraction of infections detected by testing may even be higher than 25 percent, which would produce an even lower estimate of seroprevalence.\n\n2) The infection fatality rate is an age-specific value that also depends on gender and pre-existing morbidities. The best available data for the U.S. population indicates a value of 0.6 (95% CI: 0.51-0.7), which comes from Figure 2 of this study by O\u2019Driscoll et al.[1].\n\nUsing the same number of deaths as the author indicates that 0.15%/0.6% = 25% of the U.S. population has been infected, rather than two-thirds as the author claims.\n\nThus, the author\u2019s argument that 55 \u2013 66 percent of the U.S. population has already been infected and has immunity is not supported by available data.\n\nTara Smith, Professor, College of Public Health, Kent State University:\n\nThere are a lot of errors here, probably because the author has no background in infectious disease. The author of the T cell research cited says it\u2019s misused (see that and more info in this Twitter thread). And not all reinfections are mild[2].\n\nWilliam Hanage, Associate Professor of Epidemiology, Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health:\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list.\n\nThe estimates of how many have been infected do not tally with those of others (for example, see this analysis of attack rate). But because these numbers inevitably lag, the best way to show this is probably the section where the national per capita mortality is used to estimate how many people have been infected. In reality, this statistic varied hugely by state, with more than 2500/million dead in New Jersey, less than 1000/million in Virginia, and about 300/million in Hawaii. This suggests great regional differences in the amount of infection that has occurred and the resulting immunity. Note that the role of the holidays in producing a peak is illustrated by the fact that Hawaii saw a small peak around the same time as the rest of the country in early January, despite having little evidence of immunity and a very different climate. While cases are down nationally, in some regions\u2014including some with very high per capita mortality rates\u2014they are showing signs of plateauing.\n\nThere are numerous misstatements about the weight of evidence when it comes to reinfections. It should be noted that if your bar for reinfections is two PCR tests with a genome from each, that makes them very hard to detect\u2014even more so when, as the article states, many initial infections are never detected! Probably the best single counterpoint is the example of Manaus, which is held up in the article as an example of herd immunity. The article fails to mention that since the research it cites was published, Manaus has suffered a surge of infections even worse than the one that it saw at the start of the pandemic[4,5]. It is not known to what extent the circulating variant P.1 contributed to the surge, or how many cases were reinfections, but it should be more than enough to demonstrate the dangers of trusting to \u201cherd immunity\u201d from infection for protection.\n\nThe article\u2019s statement that \u201cmost infections are asymptomatic\u201d is not true[7].\n\nFinally, the arrival of the B.1.1.7 variant which is approximately 50% more transmissible means that a larger proportion of the population needs to be immune to drop the reproductive number below one[8]. While April may well be considerably better than the worst of the winter, this should be placed in the context of seasonality[9]. Overemphasizing population immunity is misleading and could discourage people from vaccination.\n\nREFERENCES",
        "CLAIM Lancet study showed that vaccinated people have lower immune function than unvaccinated people; COVID-19 vaccines suppress the immune system more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: Kenji Yamamoto, Tucker Carlson, Fox News, The Hodgetwins, 21 Jul. 2022 DETAILS Misrepresents source: The Lancet study cited in the video examined how COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness wanes over time. The study didn\u2019t examine immunity to infectious diseases in general nor did it find that COVID-19 vaccines weaken the immune system.\n\nMisleading: The review article by Seneff et al. provided no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines weaken the immune system. KEY TAKE AWAY No scientific evidence supports the claim that COVID-19 vaccination weakens the immune system. On the contrary, vaccination helps our immune system to better defend itself against infection. Large-scale clinical trials and scientific studies found that the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccines outweigh their risks.\n\nFULL CLAIM: A Lancet study \u201cshowed that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among the unvaccinated individuals\u201d; \u201cit's looking likely that the vaccine might suppress the immune system\u201d\n\nREVIEW\n\nOn 21 July 2022, Fox News host Tucker Carlson claimed that \u201cit\u2019s looking likely that [COVID-19] vaccines suppress the immune system\u201d. To support that assertion, Carlson cited a review article by Seneff et al. and a comment in Virology Journal by cardiologist Kenji Yamamoto. Carlson\u2019s news segment was shared by political commentators The Hodgetwins and cardiologist Peter McCullough, who previously made false claims about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Political commentator Ben Swann also made the same claim as Carlson in this video on Facebook, citing the same articles.\n\nThe claim isn\u2019t new; Health Feedback already debunked this claim here, here, and here. Claims like this illustrate how scientific publishing has proven to be an effective vehicle for spreading misinformation, by lending a sheen of credibility to inaccurate and misleading claims and narratives. This review will explain how this iteration of the claim by Carlson relies on speculations that lack scientific evidence as well as misrepresentations of a study published in the scientific journal The Lancet.\n\nArticle by Seneff et al. claiming that mRNA vaccines cause health problems like cancer is based on speculations that lack supporting evidence\n\nIn a review article, Seneff et al. claimed that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines could weaken the immune system through various biological pathways and increase the risk of infection and cancer. It should be noted that its lead author is Stephanie Seneff, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has no training in infectious diseases or vaccines. Seneff has claimed that vaccines cause autism, a claim that has been disproven by large-scale scientific studies which have thus far shown no association between vaccination and risk of autism.\n\nIn an email to Health Feedback, Angeline Rouers, a senior research fellow at the A*STAR Infectious Diseases Labs in Singapore, stated that she found the review to be misleading and based on misinterpretation of scientific studies. The authors claimed that the innate immune response, in particular type I interferon, is suppressed because COVID-19 vaccines favor the adaptive immune response instead. However, the fact that COVID-19 vaccination promotes adaptive immunity as opposed to innate immunity isn\u2019t surprising.\n\n\u201cIt is normal and expected to observe different immune profiles following vaccination and infection,\u201d said Rouers. \u201cThe vaccines provide long-term protection against COVID-19 without the sickness that comes from infection. Therefore, the immune reaction that vaccination elicits is different from that stimulated by infection.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the promotion of adaptive immunity by COVID-19 vaccination doesn\u2019t imply the suppression of the innate immune system and \u201chas no impact on the immunity against other pathogens or against cancer,\u201d Rouers clarified. [See Rouers\u2019 full remarks here.]\n\nIndeed, a group of scientists, led by oncologist J\u00e9r\u00f4me Barriere, published a reply to the review, available on the OSF preprint server, also remarking on the same issue, among others.\n\nBarriere et al. wrote that the authors\u2019 claim about type I interferon impairment is based on a preprint[1] showing \u201ca differential gene expression profile in peripheral dendritic cells based on vaccinal status, but do not support the authors\u2019 claim that there is Type I IFN suppression due to the vaccine. Reliable research shows this is simply the reaction expected from a vaccine: a high immune response without a systemic and uncontrolled inflammation\u201d.\n\nJeffrey Morris, professor of biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania, discussed the article by Seneff et al. in a Twitter thread. One of the most significant flaws in the article, he pointed out, is that it\u2019s primarily rooted in speculation. For instance, the authors suggested that mRNA vaccination is associated with diseases like herpes zoster reactivation, liver damage, and optic neuropathy, even though there\u2019s no evidence that a link exists.\n\nThe article also claimed to present \u201cevidence that vaccination induces a profound impairment in type I interferon signaling, which has diverse adverse consequences to human health\u201d. While it did discuss several biological pathways, the authors didn\u2019t present evidence demonstrating that these pathways are actually affected by mRNA vaccines.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, they link to other vaccines, old mRNA technology, or COVID-19 infection, but are not directly linked to mRNA vaccines,\u201d Morris said. Interestingly, he observed that much of the evidence cited was related to severe COVID-19, meaning that \u201cmuch content in this article might be better suited to a paper pointing out potential downstream dangers of severe COVID infections rather than raising alarm about mRNA vaccination\u201d.\n\nThe authors sought to strengthen their claim about the dangers of COVID-19 vaccines by citing reports from the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). For example, the authors analyzed VAERS reports of anosmia (loss of smell) and concluded that it was a sign the vaccine caused nerve damage. However, as Morris pointed out, anosmia is common with COVID-19, whereas it isn\u2019t with vaccination. Therefore, these cases of anosmia could be explained by a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. But the authors ignored this possible explanation for their observation.\n\nIn support of their claim, the authors also cited the fact that VAERS reports related to COVID-19 vaccines made up the majority of reports for 2021 compared to other vaccines like the flu vaccine. However, they failed to account for differences in reporting rates between vaccines and the possibility that people are more likely to file VAERS reports after a COVID-19 vaccine than for other vaccines. A similar claim was addressed by Health Feedback here.\n\nBy analyzing VAERS reports of various \u201cnegative control events\u201d\u2014events we can safely exclude as being linked to vaccination\u2014such as toothache, limb X-rays, and alopecia (hair loss), Morris found that reporting for COVID-19 vaccines is indeed disproportionately higher than for other vaccines. For example, 97.2% of reports about toothache and 88.3% of reports about limb X-rays were filed after a COVID-19 vaccine. We have no reason to believe that COVID-19 vaccines cause toothache or limb X-rays, meaning that the large proportion of reports attributed to COVID-19 vaccines are the result of people being more likely to report adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination, not because COVID-19 vaccines are harmful.\n\nOverall, the review presented a series of speculations about how mRNA vaccines might affect health\u2014all in favor of the narrative that COVID-19 vaccines are harmful\u2014but without presenting direct evidence that the changes they speculated would happen actually occur.\n\nAs Morris pointed out, the review at best provides \u201chypotheses to validate, not principles to assume true unless disproven\u201d. Furthermore, the responsibility for validating these hypotheses lies with the authors themselves, as Morris pointed out, but instead the authors demanded for public health authorities to prove them wrong\u2014a typical example of shifting the burden of proof.\n\nComment by Yamamoto misrepresented the research and findings of a study in The Lancet by Nordstr\u00f6m et al.\n\nYamamoto\u2019s comment in Virology Journal, published in June 2022, claimed that a Lancet study, published in February 2022, showed \u201cimmune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among unvaccinated individuals\u201d. Yamamoto also went on to assert that \u201cAs a safety measure, further booster vaccinations should be discontinued\u201d and that \u201cCOVID-19 vaccination is a major risk factor for infections in critically ill patients\u201d.\n\nHowever, this misrepresents the Lancet study performed by Nordstr\u00f6m et al. The study examined the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, and death up to nine months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose[2]. It reported that vaccine effectiveness decreased over time, meaning that the protection offered by the vaccines isn\u2019t permanent.\n\nIt also considered that its findings \u201c[strengthen] the evidence-based rationale for administration of a third vaccine dose as a booster, where the priority should be specific populations who are at higher risk of severe consequences of COVID-19 due to weaker and more rapidly waning vaccine-elicited immunogenicity\u201d. This is the complete opposite of Yamamoto\u2019s comment, which inaccurately extrapolated the findings of the study, which were related only to COVID-19, with infectious diseases in general.\n\nOther statements raise questions about the scientific credibility of Yamamoto\u2019s comment. In one example, he wrote that \u201cThe media have so far concealed the adverse events of vaccine administration, such as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), owing to biased propaganda\u201d.\n\nThis is false; on the contrary, multiple mainstream media reports about VITT exist, like these by Reuters, the BBC, and the CBC, and have received much attention from both the scientific community and the public. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that the risk of blood clots following COVID-19 is higher than after vaccination, as a study of more than 29.1 million people in the UK showed[3].\n\nYamamoto also claimed that \u201cIt has been hypothesized that there will be an increase in cardiovascular diseases, especially acute coronary syndromes, caused by the spike proteins in genetic vaccines\u201d. One of the scientific references he used to support this claim is an abstract by cardiothoracic surgeon Steven Gundry, which appeared in the medical journal Circulation in November 2021. An abstract is a brief summary of research findings, not a scientific study in itself.\n\nGundry\u2019s abstract received an Expression of Concern from the journal on 24 November 2021. The notice stated that \u201cthere is no data in the abstract regarding myocardial T-cell infiltration, there are no statistical analyses for significance provided, and the author is not clear that only anecdotal data was used\u201d. In other words, no evidence was presented for the claims made in the abstract. But Yamamoto made no mention of the Expression of Concern or the problems with the abstract.\n\nWhile it is true that certain COVID-19 mRNA vaccines increase the risk of heart inflammation, in particular young men, the risk of heart inflammation and other health problems is much greater after getting COVID-19[4]. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that teenage boys were two to six times more likely to develop heart complications after COVID-19 than after vaccination, while the risk was seven to eight times higher in young men[5].\n\nOverall, the comment entirely misrepresented the findings of a Lancet study and emphasized the risks of COVID-19 vaccination while leaving out the fact that the risks associated with COVID-19 is much higher. It paints a misleading picture of the scientific state of understanding regarding the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. In fact, the evidence shows that it is safer to get vaccinated than remain unvaccinated.\n\n\n\nSCIENTISTS\u2019 FEEDBACK\n\nAng\u00e9line Rouers, Senior Research Fellow, A*STAR Infectious Diseases Labs:\n\nThe review by Seneff et al. is misleading and based on a misinterpretation of scientific data. The review is based on independent scientific evidence which are then combined to lead to a false conclusion: mRNA vaccines weaken innate immunity, particularly interferon (IFN) response.\n\nIt is known that type I IFN, which is part of the innate immune system, is particularly important in cancer. Mutations of IFN-related genes contribute to the development of cancer and IFN is a common therapy to treat tumor growth[6]. As for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, studies have shown that they instead favor the adaptive immune response (antibodies, memory T and B cells). Based on these observations, the authors of the review raised the concern that the innate immune response, particularly the IFN response, is suppressed following vaccination, in contrast to strong inflammation during infection.\n\nHowever, it is normal and expected to observe different immune profiles following vaccination and infection[1]. The vaccines provide long-term protection against COVID-19 without the sickness that comes from infection. Therefore, the immune reaction that vaccination elicits is different from that stimulated by infection.\n\nIn the context of vaccination, promoting memory immune responses like B cells is the most important for antiviral immunity[7]. Innate responses have very limited memory and their stimulation via vaccination is less relevant.\n\nFurthermore, the limited IFN response following COVID-19 vaccination is not evidence of weakened immunity and has no impact on the immunity against other pathogens or against cancer. Thus, the claim that mRNA vaccines weaken the immune system isn\u2019t supported by scientific evidence.\n\nFinally, the comment by K. Yamamoto is another misinterpretation of a published study. His comment says: \u201cThe study showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among unvaccinated individuals\u201d. However, the actual observation of this study is that immunity wanes after vaccination. We already know this and it is this waning that justifies the need for a booster shot. In addition, the study reported that the unvaccinated always have a higher incidence of infection compared to vaccinated. In general, studies support the use of vaccine boosters to reduce the risk of hospitalization, even against Omicron[8].\n\nUPDATE (4 August 2022):\n\nThe review was updated to include an iteration of the claim by Ben Swann.\n\nUPDATE (29 July 2022):\n\nDr. Rouers\u2019 comment was received and included after the initial publication. This comment further supports the original verdict and did not modify it. A reference to the letter by Barriere et al. was also added to the review.\n\nREFERENCES",

Azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin\u201d; \u201cAnthony Fauci has admitted that [the COVID-19 vaccines] don\u2019t work very well\u201d\n\nREVIEW\n\nOn 17 July 2022, political activist Charlie Kirk published a video on Facebook, claiming that Canadian data showed COVID-19 vaccines increase the risk of death from COVID-19. The video was viewed more than 720,000 times and shared more than 21,000 times. Kirk also rehashed old, inaccurate, and misleading claims that COVID-19 vaccines are \u201cgene-altering therapy\u201d that hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin cure COVID-19, which have already been debunked by fact-checkers before, as we will show below.\n\nClaim 1 (Incorrect): \u201c\u2018Stunning\u2019 official Canadian data now shows vaccines raise the risk of death from COVID. Vaccinated people are more likely to be hospitalized or die from COVID.\u201d\n\nKirk cited an article by journalist Alex Berenson to support this claim. Berenson, who made multiple inaccurate and misleading claims about COVID-19 and vaccines, claimed in a Substack article that data from the Manitoban government showed that, vaccinated people \u201cwere about 50 percent more likely to be hospitalized or die of Covid than unvaccinated people\u201d in May 2022. Below is the graph referenced by Berenson.\n\n\n\nThe age-standardized rate of hospital admissions, ICU admissions, and deaths associated with COVID-19 in Manitoba for April (top) and May (bottom) 2022. Note how the trends in April contrast with those in May.\n\nWhile the data presented here accounted for differences in risk due to age\u2014which is important because severe COVID-19 is associated with advanced age\u2014 the difference in the number of vaccinated and unvaccinated people, and the amount of time a person spent in each vaccination status, there are other important factors that remain unaccounted for. For example, people with preexisting health conditions that increase their risk of severe COVID-19 are more likely to be overrepresented among vaccinated people. This, along with differences in infection levels, different variants, and differing levels in immunity from prior infection, mean that age-standardized rates don\u2019t necessarily reflect vaccine effectiveness, as the UK Office of National Statistics cautioned:\n\n\u201cThe [age-standardized mortality rates] give the age-adjusted risk of death for the people in the different vaccination status groups. Estimating vaccine effectiveness is challenging when vaccination status is not allocated at random, as factors that vary between the vaccination status groups and over time need to be accounted for to determine the causal impact of vaccines on mortality.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the data showed a different trend in April 2022, just a month before the one that Berenson used, indicating a lower rate of hospitalizations and deaths in both the vaccinated and the people who received a booster dose. Therefore, Berenson may have cherry-picked data that supported the narrative he wished to present and left out data that conflicted with his narrative.\n\nIf the COVID-19 vaccines contributed to the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, as Berenson and Kirk claimed, we would expect to see the same or even more pronounced trend in people who received a booster dose (the blue bar in the graph), since these people received the most doses among the three groups. However, the rate of death in people who received a booster dose is the same as in unvaccinated people, not higher. Berenson himself was aware of this, as he wrote: \u201cPeople who had received boosters had roughly the same risk of hospitalization or death as the unvaccinated\u201d. Nevertheless, he went on to claim that the \u201cdata show vaccines now RAISE the risk of death from Covid\u201d, which is demonstrably false.\n\nData for the whole of Canada\u2014which provides a larger sample size than just Manitoba alone\u2014also contradict Berenson\u2019s claim. Health Canada reported that from 9 May to 5 June 2022, \u201cunvaccinated cases were 4 times more likely to be hospitalized and 5 times more likely to die from their illness, compared to cases with a completed primary vaccine series. During the same 4-week period, unvaccinated cases were 4 times more likely to be hospitalized and 6 times more likely to die from their illness, compared to cases with a completed primary vaccine series and 1 or more additional doses\u201d.\n\nLarge-scale studies support this observation, finding that COVID-19 vaccines reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 and death. Indeed, a modeling study published in The Lancet Infectious Disease estimated that COVID-19 vaccination saved tens of millions of lives globally[1]. While the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has dampened vaccine effectiveness against disease[2,3], getting vaccinated remains safer than not getting vaccinated.\n\nClaim 2 (Misrepresents source): \u201cAnthony Fauci has admitted that [the COVID-19 vaccines] don\u2019t work very well\u201d\n\nAs evidence for this claim, Kirk highlighted a Fox News segment from 12 July 2022, in which Anthony Fauci, the White House chief medical advisor, said:\n\n\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s clear from the data [is] that even though vaccines \u2013 because of the high degree of transmissibility of this virus \u2013 don\u2019t protect overly well, as it were, against infection, they protect quite well against severe disease leading to hospitalization and death.\u201d\n\nHowever, Kirk only presented the part where Fauci said that \u201cvaccines \u2013 because of the high degree of transmissibility of this virus \u2013 don\u2019t protect overly well\u201d, leaving out the rest in which he clarified that COVID-19 vaccines are still effective at keeping people from becoming seriously ill and dying. By doing so, Kirk distorted the meaning of Fauci\u2019s words.\n\nClaim 3 (Factually inaccurate): COVID-19 vaccines are \u201cgene-altering therapy\u201d\n\nThis old claim is false and has been refuted many times. As explained in numerous fact-checks, the COVID-19 vaccines cannot alter our DNA. The mRNA used in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are unable to directly integrate into our DNA, because RNA is chemically different from DNA.\n\nNevertheless, some continued to propagate this false claim through various means, such as by citing an inaccurate Forbes article headline or a study by Lund University, which allegedly showed that RNA from the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was reverse-transcribed, or converted into DNA, and entered the cells. The study set out to determine if mRNA from the vaccine was reverse-transcribed and if so, whether the resulting DNA entered the nucleus of the cell, where DNA is stored. The experiments were conducted in human liver cells originating from a hepatocarcinoma (liver cancer). As this Health Feedback review explained, the experiments didn\u2019t show that vaccine mRNA was reverse-transcribed or that foreign DNA entered the nucleus of the cells, much less integrate into cell DNA.\n\nClaim 4 (Unsupported): \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they still talking about therapeutics? Azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin\u201d\n\nEarly in the pandemic, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and ivermectin were touted by some as preventative and curative medicine for COVID-19. However, there is no reliable scientific evidence to support this claim. As we reported in previous Health Feedback reviews, large-scale randomized controlled trials, including those conducted by the University of Oxford and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, didn\u2019t find any of these drugs to be effective at reducing the risk of infection, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19[4-7].\n\nREFERENCES",
        "Three scientists analyzed the article and estimate its overall scientific credibility to be low. more about the credibility rating\n\nA majority of reviewers tagged the article as: Biased, Flawed reasoning, Inaccurate, Misleading.\n\n1.3k SHARES Share Tweet\n\nSCIENTISTS\u2019 FEEDBACK\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nThis Washington Times opinion piece, published on 5 August 2021, made multiple claims about the evolution of virus variants, immune escape, as well as COVID-19 vaccine safety. Authored by Robert Malone, a scientist who formerly worked at the Salk Institute in the field of molecular biology, and Peter Navarro, an economist who served as the Director of the White House National Trade Council during the Trump administration, the opinion piece received more than 12,000 engagements on Facebook, including more than 4,800 shares, according to CrowdTangle, a social media analytics tool. The article also received some user engagements on Twitter and Reddit.\n\nMalone and Navarro claimed that universal vaccination was based on four \u201cflawed assumptions\u201d, namely that: 1) universal vaccination can eradicate the virus, 2) the COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, 3) the COVID-19 vaccines are safe and 4) vaccine-mediated immunity is durable.\n\nThe key argument made by Malone and Navarro as to the imprudence of a universal vaccination strategy\u2014in fact pursued by many other countries besides the U.S., despite the article\u2019s headline\u2014is that this would create an evolutionary \u201carms race\u201d, leading to the accelerated generation of vaccine-resistant variants. [Editor\u2019s note: Navarro went on to repeat the same claims in a Newsmax article published in November 2021.]\n\nExperts who reviewed the opinion piece found it to be inaccurate and misleading. They explained that Malone and Navarro\u2019s assertions of \u201cflawed assumptions\u201d about universal vaccination were themselves wrong. [See scientists\u2019 full comments.]\n\nAng\u00e9line Rouers, an immunologist and research fellow at the Infectious Diseases Labs of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research in Singapore, told Health Feedback that the argument by Malone and Navrro isn\u2019t grounded in scientific evidence. It is not widespread vaccination that promotes mutations and leads to \u201cexposure to more and more risk\u201d, she said. \u201cOn the contrary, the rapid vaccination of as many people as possible is crucial to stop the variants. The virus mutates, not because of vaccination but because it is a virus, and every virus in the world can mutate.\u201d\n\nEmma Hodcroft, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bern and co-developer of Nextstrain, a project which tracks the evolution of viruses including SARS-CoV-2, highlighted the fallacy of the argument.\n\n\u201cAny type of immunity present in the population will provide a selection pressure for the virus to get around this immunity, if it can,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not just vaccine immunity which provides this selection pressure: immunity from infection does as well.\u201d\n\nIndeed, of the four existing variants of concern to date, all four emerged in 2020, long before the start of public vaccination campaigns. In particular, the Delta variant, which has been making headlines around the world, was first detected in October 2020. This observation demonstrates that halting vaccination efforts won\u2019t stop the emergence of virus variants\u2014after all, variants are entirely capable of emerging in the absence of vaccination.\n\nIn addition, Malone and Navarro misleadingly cited the risk of side effects from the COVID-19 vaccines as a reason why universal vaccination wasn\u2019t optimal. Dale Fisher, a professor of medicine at the National University of Singapore who specializes in infectious diseases, refuted this notion. \u201cIt is very clear that the risks of vaccination are much lower than the risks of COVID-19,\u201d he said. \u201cThe article\u2019s discussion surrounding virologists\u2019 fears, unreferenced or substantiated, likewise is unhelpful fear-mongering when already many long-term effects of the disease itself are emerging and much more likely.\u201d\n\nFisher also found Malone and Navarro\u2019s claim regarding the \u201cdecided lack of durability\u201d of vaccine-mediated immunity to be unsubstantiated. Similarly, Rouers also pointed out that the article failed to provide any evidence or sources to support any of its claims. She found the article\u2019s suggestion that the \u201cfar more optimal strategy is to vaccinate only the most vulnerable\u201d to be \u201cnonsense\u201d.\n\nSome of those at high risk from COVID-19, like people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients and organ transplant recipients, \u201ccannot receive the full benefits of vaccination due to their medical history and will rely on indirect protection through the vaccination of others around them (i.e. herd immunity),\u201d she said.\n\nAll three reviewers agreed that variants with immune escape abilities would always remain a possibility, with or without vaccines. \u201cNo matter what action we take, we have a future where we will have to deal with a virus responding to immune pressure,\u201d Hodcroft said.\n\nScientists are well aware of this possibility and the dangers this poses, and measures are in place to mitigate the harm this can cause. Fisher cited genetic surveillance efforts as a top priority globally to observe for the emergence of escape mutants, which future versions of COVID-19 vaccines may need to cater for.\n\nBut even if the evolution of immune escape remains a concern with or without vaccines, how we choose to confront this problem will lead to significantly different outcomes for public health and the virus\u2019 ability to outsmart the immune system, Hodcroft pointed out.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that high population immunity can be achieved through infection, but this goes hand in hand with needless suffering and death that vaccination would prevent. It would also offer the virus much more opportunities to acquire mutations.\n\nOn the other hand, vaccination gives us an edge in the game, by reducing transmission rates while achieving a high level of population immunity. By reducing transmission and in turn infection, we deprive the virus of opportunities to acquire new mutations that make it more dangerous or transmissible.\n\nYou can read the original Washington Times article here.\n\n\n\nSCIENTISTS\u2019 OVERALL FEEDBACK:\n\nEmma Hodcroft, Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Basel:\n\nI will comment primarily on the claims about evolution and mutation in the context of vaccination or widespread infection. I\u2019m not a medical doctor, and so even though their claims about vaccine harms and drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine aren\u2019t consistent with the published literature and reports by governments, I will not comment on this.\n\nViruses are some of the fastest-evolving pathogens we know, which is part of what makes them so tricky. For instance, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) evolves so quickly that our immune systems can\u2019t keep up with \u201crecognizing\u201d it. That\u2019s part of why it\u2019s a chronic\u2014and if untreated, fatal\u2014disease.\n\nFor most human viruses we encounter, however, the outcome is much less grim. Our bodies learn to recognise it, which protects us from infection and/or serious outcomes when we meet it again in the future. However, for many viruses this is a dance we participate in for the rest of our lives\u2014though we learn to recognise what infects us, the virus will change, and we may not recognise it as well next time. In some cases, we may remain protected for the rest of our non-frail lives from serious outcomes, but not from infection itself, with or without mild symptoms.\n\nAny type of immunity present in the population will provide a selection pressure for the virus to get around this immunity, if it can. In many cases however, and particularly for viruses like coronaviruses, evidence suggests that this escape is usually not complete, particularly over shorter time periods. This means that even if you get infected, you benefit from \u201cimperfect immunity\u201d by being protected against severe outcomes.\n\nWe see this reflected in what we have learned from SARS-CoV-2 vaccination data. This means that even when viruses have selection pressure on them from population immunity, it is not correct to assume, as the article does (\u201cever more powerful vaccines will have to be developed\u201d), that just because we may see some level of immune escape, this means that booster vaccines will be needed forever, or beyond the most vulnerable, or very frequently.\n\nBut most importantly, it\u2019s not only vaccine immunity which provides this selection pressure: immunity from infection does as well, despite the impression given by the article (\u201cThe more people you vaccinate, the greater the number of vaccine-resistant mutations you are likely to get\u201d). In fact, it is hypothesized that some of the variants we have already seen, with some apparent immune escape like Gamma, arose in places where previous infection levels (and thus infection-mediated immunity) were high, and thus this may have put pressure for immune escape.\n\nThus no matter what action we take, we have a future where we will have to deal with a virus responding to immune pressure, whether through most of the population being infected eventually\u2014and with more transmissible variants like Delta as well as reopening, we can see this future clearly in the huge waves in areas with low vaccination rates\u2014through vaccine-mediated immunity, or through a combination of both.\n\nWhat\u2019s key is that there\u2019s a huge difference in how you reach these two goals. The risks of vaccination are incredibly low, particularly for the mRNA vaccines, and means we can keep the transmission rates of the virus low *while* getting high population immunity. On the other hand, we know that SARS-CoV-2 has very real risks for many people in our population. Even for age groups where the risk is relatively low, if you infect millions of people, you will see bad outcomes. Allowing the entire population to be infected\u2014even excluding the most vulnerable\u2014will cause a lot of hospitalizations, deaths, and suffering along the way, which is entirely preventable through vaccination.\n\nFinally, population-level immunity achieved through infection requires, by definition, high levels of virus transmission. This provides the most opportunity for the virus to find itself in people with the imperfect immunity where immune-avoiding mutations could be selected. On the other hand, vaccine-mediated immunity could be achieved with zero virus circulating. While that extreme may not be realistic, we can achieve it while keeping virus levels very low, minimizing the chance that the virus has to have these mutations selected for.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that except for eliminating SARS-CoV-2 entirely, we cannot entirely stop the virus from developing escape mutations, we can make this much harder. Even when vaccine-mediated immunity is imperfect, evidence suggests it makes it harder to be infected and harder to transmit\u2014these are opportunities we take away from the virus. Further, it may be that those who may be vaccinated & infected may be able to eliminate the virus faster from the body, or have fewer viruses circulating while infected\u2014all of which remove more opportunities for dangerous mutation.\n\nIn short, there is no future in which we won\u2019t have to potentially face mutations that escape immunity to some degree. However, the future that is much less risky is reached by minimizing the chance of these mutations and minimizing the risk by which we achieve population-level immunity, and that\u2019s through vaccination.\n\nFinally, to address this quote: \u201cThe clear historical tendency for viruses crossing over from one species to another is to evolve in a way that makes them both more infectious and less pathogenic over time.\u201d In fact, there is no clear historical tendency. Is HIV less fatal? Influenza?\n\nThe base fallacy here is that any virus that kills some hosts sometimes is under strong selection never to kill at all, when actually the selection is at the far end, which the authors illustrate that they recognize: \u201cA virus can\u2019t efficiently spread if, like with Ebola, it quickly kills its hosts.\u201d\u2014if it kills before it transmits. But if the virus transmits before it kills, it does not much care what happens to the host.\n\nParticularly, as is the case with SARS-CoV-2, when transmission has many opportunities (SARS-CoV-2 is respiratory, whereas Ebola spreads through fluids), death takes weeks (plenty of time to transmit), and occurs in a relatively (from the virus\u2019 point of view) small number of infections. Even in cases where viruses may be under selection to become less deadly (which does not seem obvious for SARS-CoV-2), \u201cless deadly\u201d does not equal \u201cnot deadly\u201d\u2014they may simply evolve to kill you after four weeks instead of four days, for example, or kill 15% rather than 30%.\n\nFurther, a lot of the \u201cattenuation\u201d we may observe for viruses over time, for those where we estimate they jumped into humans relatively recently, is likely due instead to immunity. A virus that is very dangerous at the first exposure is likely less dangerous once the entire population has some level of immunity, which in the past would have been after everyone had been infected).\n\nExposure at different ages also makes a difference. As we see with SARS-CoV-2, young children seem at relatively little risk. If everyone was exposed as a child (as they are to many, many other viruses, like influenza and seasonal coronaviruses), the virus may be inconsequential for almost the rest of their lives (old age seems to make people more vulnerable to respiratory viruses). But this is through early exposure and immunity (and possibly repeated exposure), not through the virus becoming less virulent.\n\nDale Fisher, Professor (Department of Medicine), National University of Singapore:\n\nThis article has inaccuracies throughout with a clear view to push an anti-vaccine agenda. The picture depicting a skull with eyes and nose made of coronaviruses in the shape of the U.S. is sensationalist. The opening line calls it Biden\u2019s strategy. It was also Trump\u2019s and is the strategy of every country and the WHO.\n\nFlawed assumption #1 in the article is wrong. No one believes the virus will be eradicated. It\u2019s also not about herd immunity. It\u2019s about turning this into a mild illness and reducing transmission.\n\nFlawed assumption #2 stemming from the first: No one believes it\u2019s perfect. We know transmission continues. Everything else is true and this is built into the strategies.\n\nFlawed assumption #3: Again, no one denies the risk of side effects. Indeed the scientific community and national authorities globally have been clear in discussing thrombotic, cardiomyopathic, and anaphylactic risks. It is very clear that the risks of vaccination are much lower than the risks of COVID-19. The article\u2019s discussion surrounding virologists\u2019 fears (unreferenced or substantiated) likewise is unhelpful fear-mongering when already many long-term effects of the disease itself are emerging and much more likely.\n\nFlawed assumption #4: There is no good evidence yet that the lack of durability exists. If it is true, we may find that some vaccines are more durable than others and even future generations of vaccines could be better. No one is saying we don\u2019t have more to learn and that R&D has stopped. It is true however that boosters may be necessary.\n\nIt is theoretically possible that variants could escape vaccine-related immunity, but all the variants of concern to date have shown increased transmissibility, and in some cases, immune escape in the absence of vaccines. The rest of the conjecture is just that: conjecture. Genetic surveillance has a high priority globally to observe for the emergence of escape mutants, and yes, future versions of the vaccine may need to cater for these. Malone and Navarro\u2019s list of \u201cnumerous other useful treatments\u201d is not consistent with the findings of most clinical trials and is not standard practice.\n\nAng\u00e9line Rouers, Senior Research Fellow, A*STAR Infectious Diseases Labs:\n\nThe article does not mention any source to support the claims. The only reference at the end is the fact that one author was the \u201cdiscoverer of the mRNA vaccine\u201d (which is an exaggerated claim) and that the other served in the White House as the Defense Production Act Policy Coordinator during the Trump administration. Neither of these statements offer support for the scientific claims they make in the article. To clarify the main claims and put the things at the right place:\n\nAbout assumption 1 in the article: There is a confusion about the relationship between vaccination and mutations. The massive vaccination of the population doesn\u2019t promote mutations and lead to \u201cexposure to more and more risk\u201d. On the contrary, the rapid vaccination of as many people as possible is crucial to stop the variants. The virus mutates not because of vaccination but because it is a virus, and every virus in the world can mutate.\n\nSome of the mutations make the virus stronger and sometimes more transmissible. Some vaccines may become useless against certain variants but for now\u2014even if it is demonstrated that there is a reduction in neutralizing activity against the variants\u2014vaccines are still effective. But if not enough people are vaccinated, the variants will continue to emerge. The massive immunisation\u2014through vaccination\u2014will stop the variant race, not elicit it!\n\nAbout assumption 2 in the article: All vaccines come with side effects. There is always the risk-benefit balance to take into account. In the context of COVID-19 vaccines, the eventual side effects observed remain very rare and don\u2019t reach an abnormal rate that justifies halting their use. Adverse events such as the disruption of women\u2019s menstrual cycle have been rarely observed, and up until now, not shown to be causally linked to vaccination. However, when these observations are made, scientists are encouraged to investigate more in detail to rule out all possible links.\n\nIt is true that certain kinds of vaccines can lead to unexpected reactions depending on the medical history of the individual. That\u2019s why this history or current health condition of the subject, such as pregnancy, is always taken into account when deciding which vaccine to give. Allergic reactions are recognized as a possible side effect, but people are closely monitored for this reaction after vaccination.\n\nAbout assumption 3 in the article: Vaccination of the most vulnerable only sounds like a nonsense strategy. Some of them cannot receive the full benefits of vaccination due to their medical history and will rely on indirect protection through the vaccination of others around them. That\u2019s the principle of herd immunity.\n\nANNOTATIONS\n\nThe statements quoted below are from the article; comments are from the reviewers (and are lightly edited for clarity).\n\n\u201cThe more people you vaccinate, the greater the number of vaccine-resistant mutations you are likely to get, the less durable the vaccines will become, ever more powerful vaccines will have to be developed, and individuals will be exposed to more and more risk.\u201d\n\nAny type of immunity present in the population will provide a selection pressure for the virus to get around this immunity, if it can. In many cases however, and particularly for viruses like coronaviruses, evidence suggests that this escape is usually not complete, particularly over shorter time periods. This means that even if you get infected, you benefit from \u201cimperfect immunity\u201d by being protected against severe outcomes. We see this reflected in what we have learned from SARS-CoV-2 vaccination data. This means that even when viruses have selection pressure on them from population immunity, it is not correct to assume, as the article does, that just because we may see some level of immune escape, this means that booster vaccines will be needed forever, or beyond the most vulnerable, or very frequently.\n\nBut most importantly, it\u2019s not only vaccine immunity which provides this selection pressure: immunity from infection does as well, despite the impression given by the article (\u201cThe more people you vaccinate, the greater the number of vaccine-resistant mutations you are likely to get\u201d). In fact, it is hypothesized that some of the variants we have already seen, with some apparent immune escape like Gamma, arose in places where previous infection levels (and thus infection-mediated immunity) were high, and thus this may have put pressure for immune escape.\n\n\u201cThe clear historical tendency for viruses crossing over from one species to another is to evolve in a way that makes them both more infectious and less pathogenic over time.\u201c\n\nIn fact, there is no clear historical tendency. Is HIV less fatal? Influenza?\n\nThe base fallacy here is that any virus that kills some hosts sometimes is under strong selection never to kill at all, when actually the selection is at the far end, which the authors illustrate that they recognize: \u201cA virus can\u2019t efficiently spread if, like with Ebola, it quickly kills its hosts.\u201d\u2014if it kills before it transmits. But if the virus transmits before it kills, it does not much care what happens to the host.\n\nParticularly, as is the case with SARS-CoV-2, when transmission has many opportunities (SARS-CoV-2 is respiratory, whereas Ebola spreads through fluids), death takes weeks (plenty of time to transmit), and occurs in a relatively (from the virus\u2019 point of view) small number of infections. Even in cases where viruses may be under selection to become less deadly (which does not seem obvious for SARS-CoV-2), \u201cless deadly\u201d does not equal \u201cnot deadly\u201d\u2014they may simply evolve to kill you after four weeks instead of four days, for example, or kill 15% rather than 30%.\n\nFurther, a lot of the \u201cattenuation\u201d we may observe for viruses over time, for those where we estimate they jumped into humans relatively recently, is likely due instead to immunity. A virus that is very dangerous at the first exposure is likely less dangerous once the entire population has some level of immunity, which in the past would have been after everyone had been infected).",
        "A fascinating new collaborative study, between researchers at the University of Oxford and Tufts University, has found two common viruses may be working in tandem to trigger the earliest stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The findings build on a growing body of evidence implicating the herpes virus in neurodegenerative disease.\n\nFor over half a century the idea that microbial infections are a trigger for neurodegenerative disease has been floating on the sidelines of neuroscience. In the 1980s a number of studies pointed to associations between the onset of Alzheimer's disease and herpes simplex viral infections, but exactly how this very common virus could be influencing neurodegeneration was not clear.\n\nA key 2020 study from a Tufts University team demonstrated exactly how a herpes infection could induce several pathological features of Alzheimer\u2019s. The study used a new kind of 3D bioengineered brain model that populated a sponge-like structure with neural stem cells that could be coaxed into a variety of brain cells.\n\nThis type of brain tissue model was incredibly novel, and the findings were the first to explicitly show how the common viral infection can lead to pathological signs of Alzheimer\u2019s. But a big question hovered over the findings. Considering more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s population carry herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1), there must be other factors that reactivate the dormant virus and trigger this cascade of events that lead to Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThis new study looked to another common virus that has been associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2013 varicella zoster virus (VZV). This virus causes chicken pox and, in later life, shingles. So using the 3D bioengineered brain model the researchers looked at whether VZV infection influences brain cells already seeded with dormant herpesvirus.\n\nInterestingly, the research found exposing brain cells harboring dormant HSV-1 to VZV led to a reactivation of the herpesvirus and a cascade of the toxic plaques known to be signs of Alzheimer\u2019s. However, all of these Alzheimer\u2019s signs did not appear when brain cells were exposed to VZV in the absence of herpesvirus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a one-two punch of two viruses that are very common and usually harmless, but the lab studies suggest that if a new exposure to VZV wakes up dormant HSV-1, they could cause trouble,\u201d said Dana Cairns, a researcher working on the project.\n\nWhile the study does confidently propose this two-pronged viral mechanism can lead to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, it does make clear this is likely only one pathway among many. And if reactivating dormant HSV-1 can trigger the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, there are probably a number of ways this can occur beyond an exposure to VZV.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still possible that other infections and other pathways of cause and effect could lead to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and risk factors such as head trauma, obesity, or alcohol consumption suggest they may intersect at the re-emergence of HSV in the brain,\u201d added Cairns.\n\nThe study also speculates potential future Alzheimer\u2019s problems may arise from the COVID-19 pandemic as SARS-CoV-2 infections have been known to reactivate dormant VSV and HSV-1 infections. It has been suggested the pandemic could increase future rates of neurodegenerative disease and the researchers behind this new study urge clinicians to keep a watchful eye on elderly patients over the coming years.\n\nThe new study was published in the Journal of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease.\n\nSource: Tufts University",
        "Wave Swell Energy's remarkable UniWave 200 is a sea platform that uses an artificial blowhole formation to create air pressure changes that drive a turbine and feed energy back to shore. After a year of testing, the company reports excellent results.\n\nAs we've discussed before, the UniWave system is a floatable device that can be towed to any coastal location and connected to the local energy grid. It's designed so that wave swells force water into a specially designed concrete chamber, pressurizing the air in the chamber and forcing it through an outlet valve. Then as the water recedes, it generates a powerful vacuum, which sucks air in through a turbine at the top and generates electricity that's fed into the grid via a cable.\n\nAs a result, it draws energy from the entire column of water that enters its chamber, a fact the team says makes it more efficient than wave energy devices that only harvest energy from the surface or the sea floor.\n\nThe UniWave 200 in place off King Island, Tasmania Wave Swell Energy\n\nWSE's key innovation here is that one-way generation; other devices that harvest the same effect use bi-directional turbines, requiring the ability to reverse blade pitch or redirect the airflow. WSE says its design allows for far cheaper and simpler turbines, that should also last longer since they're not getting as much salt water splashed through them when a big wave hits. Indeed, all this device's moving parts are above the waterline, a fact that should help extend its service life as well as making it completely harmless to marine life.\n\nInterestingly, the UniWave's design also makes it easy to incorporate into breakwaters and seawalls, where it can take a coastal erosion protection project and turn it into a clean energy source. You can see an animation showing how it works in the video below.\n\nWSE Technology and King Island Project\n\nA 200-kW test platform was installed last year off King Island, facing the notoriously rough seas of Bass Strait, which separates the island state of Tasmania from the mainland of Australia. There, it's been contributing reliable clean energy to the island's microgrid around the clock for a full 12 months. The WSE team has made a few live tweaks to the design during operation, improving its performance beyond original expectations.\n\n\u201cWe set out to prove that Wave Swell\u2019s wave energy converter technology could supply electricity to a grid in a range of wave conditions, and we have done that,\u201d said WSE CEO Paul Geason in a press release. \"One key achievement has been to deliver real-world results in Tasmanian ocean conditions to complement the AMC test modeling. In some instances, the performance of our technology in the ocean has exceeded expectations due to the lessons we\u2019ve learnt through the project, technological improvements and the refinements we have made over the course of the year.\"\n\n\"Our team is excited to have achieved a rate of conversion from wave power to electricity at an average of 45 to 50% in a wide range of wave conditions,\" he continues. \"This is a vast improvement on past devices and shows that the moment has arrived for wave power to sit alongside wind, solar and energy storage as part of a modern energy mix.\"\n\nWe asked Geason over email how much energy the device generated during the trial. \"It's important to stress that the demonstration at King Island was not about producing high volumes of electricity,\" he responds. \"Rather, it was to prove the capabilities of our technology in a variety of wave conditions. The results have met and at times exceeded our expectations. As an example, when the unit is generating 40 kW of power in reasonable wave conditions, you could extrapolate the amount of energy to be in the order of 1MWh in a 24 hour period.\"\n\nThe UniWave can turn erosion protection projects into clean power sources Wave Swell Energy\n\nThe King Island platform will remain in place at least until the end of 2022, and the company is now gearing up to go into production.\n\n\"Having proven our device can survive the toughest conditions the Southern Ocean and Bass Strait can throw at it, and deliver grid compliant electricity, our priority now shifts to commercializing the technology,\" said Gleason. \"For Wave Swell this means ensuring the market embraces the WSE technology and units are deployed to deliver utility scale clean electricity to mainland grids around the world.\u201d\n\nGeason tells New Atlas that commercial deployments could vary in size. \"The units can scale up from 200 kW,\" he writes. \"Exact size will depend upon the attributes of the wave climate at any particular location. The sweet spot, as you put it, will be site dependent. We're currently engaged with a number of third parties that are seeking to deploy commercial units, and our efforts and resources are focused on further deployments and commercialization of our technology.\"\n\nSee the UniWave 200 test platform running in the video below.\n\nWaveSwell PowerUp\n\nSource: Wave Swell Energy\n\nEditor's note: this piece has been updated on August 2, to include responses from our communications with WSE CEO Paul Gleason.",
        "Remember when everyone was experimenting with different kinds of cloth face mask designs back in 2020? For many, the frustration of mask wearing could be offset by the creative ways cloth masks were decoratively deployed.\n\nAs the pandemic wore on, new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged and we learned more about how this novel virus spread. Cloth masks simply weren\u2019t enough, so many people shifted to using surgical masks. But soon it became clear they weren\u2019t that effective either. In a world permanently changed by the emergence of the stunningly infectious Omicron variant, well-fitted N95 masks became the only real option for those seeking good protection from this airborne virus.\n\nNow it\u2019s 2022, and you could be forgiven for pausing a moment before you put in an order for yet another box of disposable N95 masks. There has to be a more efficient way. This virus is not going to suddenly disappear, so is the future going to be an endless cycle of buying and dumping disposable masks?\n\nThe accumulating waste problem from disposable masks is nothing short of catastrophic. Not only are hundreds of millions of face masks disposed of every single day, but the plastic fibers in the masks are adding to a frightening microplastic problem. One recent study found masks can easily leach plastics into waterways.\n\nThe solution seems simple \u2013 reusable face masks. And they do already exist. They are known as elastomeric respirators, and most of us are probably familiar with their two-chambered gas mask aesthetic. They certainly don\u2019t look elegant, and have never really taken off in health care contexts.\n\nBut traditional elastomeric respirators look the way they do because of fundamental technological limitations. To make a respirator with 95 to 99% filtration, you need a fair bit of surface area. Every time you inhale, all the air coming in needs to move through a thick filter, so the bigger the surface area the less a wearer feels like they are trying to pull each breath through a thick cloth.\n\nCurrent elastomeric respirators are big, bulky, and aesthetically imposing Depositphotos\n\nCan there be a better way?\n\nThis is exactly what Flo Mask creator Kevin Ngo wondered all the way back in 2018. Devastating wildfires that year led to his neighborhood in the San Francisco Bay Area being blanketed with toxic smoke for several weeks. He quickly whipped on a N95 but struggled to find something that worked well for his children.\n\n\u201cAnd that's when I said, 'you know what, there's got to be a solution out there, I make products for a living, I'm gonna find the best mask that they make for kids,'\u201d Ngo explains in an interview with New Atlas. \u201cBecause I'm wearing an N95 to work, and if I'm already getting headaches, my eyes are burning and tearing up from all the wildfires smoke, I can only imagine what, you know, a kindergartener or third grader\u2019s feeling at the time.\u201d\n\nThe kids' Flo Mask took two years to develop Flo Mask\n\nNgo is your classic Silicon Valley geek. For the better part of 20 years he has worked in product development for everyone from Logitech to Motorola. He currently works at Google, and after a frustrating evening in 2018 searching all over the internet for a good kids' mask he realized what he needed simply didn\u2019t exist.\n\nSo what does a Silicon Valley tech guy do when he realizes what he needs doesn\u2019t exist? He gets a bunch of friends, all award-winning product designers, and spends two years developing the best kids mask they can imagine. Ngo called in favors from all over the tech world as he tinkered with the designs for a kids' mask. Every step of the way he came across other parents willing to help out to make this thing a reality \u2013 from wrangling weekend use of one of the most advanced 3D scanners in the world to scan dozens of child faces, to leveraging silicone mold knowledge from designers on the team familiar with popular commercial products.\n\nKevin Ngo, the creator of the Flo Mask Flo Mask\n\nAnd then \u2026 2020\n\nThe pandemic hit just as Ngo was at the tail end of his first kids' Flo Mask development. By the end of 2020, the kids' Flo Mask was out but the world of pandemic masks still hadn\u2019t caught up to where Ngo was. His perfectly sealed elastomeric masks seemed overkill in a world playing around with cloth and surgical masks.\n\nAs time passed, demand grew for an adult iteration of the Flo Mask. The problem was an adult mask is a much more complicated design challenge. Kids' faces are relatively uniform, so getting close to a one-size-fits-all design wasn\u2019t too hard. Plus, new kinds of filters would be needed for adult masks to get up above the 95% efficiency expected by people currently wearing N95 masks.\n\nThe big eureka moment, according to Ngo, came when he learned a next-generation filter material had been developed in late 2019. Initially, the material was only being used by the Department of Defense but due to a random confluence of events, Ngo got his hands on a load and went about testing its efficiency.\n\nThe results were the game changer he needed to create the adult mask. Testing the material revealed it had the ability to filter with 99% efficiency over a tiny surface area while maintaining extraordinary breathability.\n\n\u201cSo if you think about the science of masks, the machine [that tests filter efficiency] uses a surface area of 100 centimeters squared,\u201d Ngo explained. \u201cIn order to hit N95 the masks they test covers up almost 100 centimeters squared. So filtration surface area correlates to how high the efficiency is. You're getting about 95%, or better, at 100 centimeters squared. The filter for flow mask, it's 57 centimeters squared, so almost half the size, but we're still getting 99% filtration, with equivalent breathability of an N95, if not better. So this is next level stuff. And that's how we're able to achieve what we've achieved.\u201d\n\nDesigning a mask to fit a variety of adult face shapes was a major challenge Flo Mask\n\nThe face challenge\n\nThe other big challenge for designing the adult Flo lay in trying to accommodate the breadth of adult face shapes. Again, the team looked at a mass of 3D face scans and came up with two design iterations based on nose bridge size \u2013 a low to medium size for people of Asian and African decent, and a medium to high nose bridge size for those of European descent.\n\nNgo calculated between these two sizes, around 90% of all adults should be accommodated by the Flo Mask. But now the mask is out in the real world it's turning out 90% was an underestimate.\n\n\u201cWe have a success rate of 98% which is pretty phenomenal,\u201d Ngo explained, after the company has now been shipping masks out to customers for a few months. \u201cConsidering we felt like, you know, we could get nine out of 10 users in our mask, of the users who have bought we're getting 98%, which is like pretty spectacular.\u201d\n\nThe adult Flo Mask went through over a dozen different design iterations before its final version arrived Flo Mask\n\nAll in all, the mask went through at least a dozen design iterations before the final version was settled upon. From painstaking work getting a glass indentation perfectly placed in the silicone mold, to working out the optimal way for the filters to sit over the mask, the attention to detail in the Flo Mask is impressive.\n\nNevertheless, there are still challenges ahead, particularly in navigating the slow bureaucracy of N95 certification. For a mask like this to be formally certified as N95 or higher in the United States it needs to go through an organization called NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health), which Ngo said may take some time.\n\nBut the Flo Mask has been selected to be a finalist in a Mask Innovation Moonshot Challenge, spearheaded by several US government agencies including NIOSH, BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority), and NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology).\n\nIn the spirit of absolute transparency, Ngo makes no claims to Flo Mask being equivalent to an authorized N95. However, as part of the Mask Innovation Challenge, the Flo Mask has been through NIOSH\u2019s testing protocol and those results have been published on YouTube.\n\nFlo Mask Pro - NIOSH & NIST Tests\n\nWhy are we still using disposable masks?\n\nTrying on the Flo Mask for the first time was a pretty eye-opening experience. After battling ill-fitting, tight, uncomfortable, disposable N95 masks for months, the Flo's silicone gasket instantly created a surprisingly good seal. The filter was easy to breathe through and my voice wasn\u2019t muffled at all talking through it.\n\nThe only slightly unusual aspect was the way the mask is designed to sit above my chin. Two years of wearing various masks that sit under my chin meant it certainly took a few moments to adjust to the very unique way the Flo Mask sits on the face.\n\nAfter a few days of using the Flo Mask I was left with one big question: Why aren\u2019t these kinds of elastomeric respirators widely used? Sure, the imposing qualities of older two-chamber respirators may have presented an unfavorable aesthetic for health care environments in the past, but that\u2019s not a problem anymore.\n\nA recent New York Times investigation into elastomeric masks had one major researcher describing the lack of adoption in health care contexts as puzzling. Emily Haas, a scientist working for NIOSH, suggested the biggest challenge in moving hospitals from disposable N95s to reusable respirators is cultural. These health care environments have for decades used disposable masks and changing that norm will take work.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been so much research in the last 10 years that has really supported elastomerics, so in some ways the issue right now is cultural,\u201d Haas said. \u201cNo one likes change, and introducing a whole new system of respiratory protection can be a heavy lift.\u201d\n\nThe US-government-led Mask Innovation Challenge seems to be part of an attempt to change these old behaviors. And Flo Mask is certainly one of the Challenge\u2019s finalists with the potential to radically alter the way we think about masks.\n\nBut right now, Flo Mask is still a labor of love for Ngo. Talking to New Atlas at 10 pm on a weeknight, after a day\u2019s work at Google and an evening spent with his kids, it\u2019s clear the years of work put into the Flo Mask have been all done in his spare time with thousands of dollars of personal savings on the line. And so far, the business is still run mostly by him, responding to emails from customers at midnight in between family life and a day job.\n\nToday in testing the @flo_mask Pro:\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Used the Everyday Filter & inhaling feels fine. No odd plasticky smells. Feels quite cool underneath w/o air leaks on exhalation.\n\n\u2611\ufe0f Unlike w/ N95s, it doesn't get dislodged while speaking.

Scrolling through Flo's Twitter account delivers a torrent of people sharing images of themselves proudly wearing the mask after somehow finding out about the Flo.\n\n\u201cI don't claim to know everything, but I've learned a lot [while developing the Flo Mask],\u201d said Ngo. \u201cAnd I feel like this is hands down the best mask anyone's ever made. Because we're taking these ginormous respirator elastomerics that you've seen for decades, and we've taken it to a size that is unheard of, with the same level of protection or almost equivalent. And, you know, it's kind of weird that a few tech guys who love making products happen to have built the best mask in the world.\u201d",
        "Concern over unknown, future side effects is by far the most common reason I hear people give for why they aren\u2019t vaccinating against COVID. At a quick glance, that may seem reasonable, but when you start really looking into the science, it quickly becomes clear that there is simply no reason to suspect that there will be dangerous long-term consequences of these vaccines. Indeed, based on everything we know about the immune system, vaccines in general, and these vaccines specifically, it is extremely unlikely that they will cause unknown, serious, wide-spread side effects in the future, and the known risks from COVID far outweigh the hypothetical risks from the vaccines.\n\nIn this post, I\u2019m going to carefully go over the science and logic that allows us to be so confident in the long-term safety of these vaccines, but before I do that, I want to briefly explain who my target audience is here, namely, the \u201cvaccine hesitant.\u201d I am refereeing to the people who usually would not consider themselves \u201canti-vaccers\u201d and would usually vaccinate themselves and their children but have been swept up in the maelstrom of misinformation and fear about the new COVID vaccines. If you are someone who is truly seeking information and trying to think for yourself, then please hear me out and seriously consider the arguments and evidence that I am going to present. Do not give in to the baseless fearmongering that is rampaging through the internet and media.\n\nTo that end, I want to point out right at the start that this tactic of stirring up fear of future, unknown, long-term consequences is not new or unique to COVID vaccines. It is straight out of the traditional anti-vaccine playbook. It is something I was writing about long before COVID, and the argument is just as flawed now as it was then. So, if you are someone who eschews the title \u201canti-vaccer,\u201d but are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of the arguments about unknown, long-term effects, please realize that these are not new arguments that arose out of legitimate concerns specifically about COVID vaccines. Rather, stoking fear of future unknowns is a standard (and flawed) anti-vaccer tactic that they have been using for decades and are now dressing up and presenting as if it is a novel concern for COVID vaccines. Do not be fooled by this tactic.\n\nThis post is necessarily long, because there\u2019s a lot to talk about in order to cover this topic properly, but, again, I have written this for people who are truly trying to think for themselves, and are truly seeking information. So if that is you, please read this carefully in its entirety.\n\nBecause of the length of this post, I will summarize key points in bullets below, before elaborating on each of them.\n\nSummary: TL;DR\n\nmRNA vaccines have been being studied for over a decade (including human trials). Current COVID vaccines have been extremely well studied, with sample sizes of hundreds of thousands of people, and studies have been compiled into large meta-analyses/systematic reviews. Thus, the short-term risks of the vaccines are extremely well-documented, and the benefits outweigh the risks. The only \u201cunknown\u201d is about long-term effects; however\u2026 No vaccine has ever caused the type of widespread, serious side effect years down the road that everyone is afraid of. Nearly all side effects occur shortly after vaccination (see #2). The only example of a sided effect that showed up months later appear within a year (whereas we\u2019ve been using COVID vaccines for over a year) and was rare. The vaccine benefits still outweighed the risks. Vaccines rarely cause long-term (future) side effects because they use low doses over a short time. Vaccines simply train your immune system. Vaccines are quickly removed from the body. Most vaccine components were well-studied, and their safety is known. mRNA: mRNA does not alter your DNA. mRNA is very quickly broken down and removed. mRNA in vaccines cannot make your body produce entire viruses. You are constantly exposed to mRNA from viruses (e.g., from colds) If you catch COVID, your cells will use viral mRNA to make proteins just like they do from the vaccine, but\u2026 Your cells will make entire viruses, not just a single protein. You will be exposed to far higher levels of mRNA. Side effects from immune stimulation will usually happen right away and will usually be worse from actual infection with COVID. A demand for long-term studies is meaningless unless you can justify why a particular length of time is needed. No matter how long something has been studied, it is always technically possible that an effect won\u2019t show up until slightly after the length of that study. This is true for all medications, foods, minerals, vitamins, etc., yet we don\u2019t fear most of them. Therefore, you must provide actual evidence or reasoning to think that a futre side-effect is actually likely. Focusing on a highly-unlikely, unknown, hypothetical risk from the vaccine while downplaying the very real and serious risk from COVID is bad risk assessment. Fears over unknown long-term effects of the vaccines are baseless. The burden of proof is on anyone claiming that the vaccines are dangerous.\n\nNot as new as you might think\n\nBefore we go into the details of the COVID vaccines, we need some background information to put them in context, and I think it is important to point out that these vaccine technologies are not as new as people are often led to believe. Sure, these exact vaccines were developed recently, but mRNA vaccines have been being developed and tested for years. Thus, the underlying technology is well-studied.\n\nLet me direct you to a review paper published in 2018 (before COVID) titled, \u201cmRNA vaccines \u2014 a new era in vaccinology\u201d (Pardi et al. 2018). This review covers over a decade of research on mRNA vaccines, including safety and efficiency trials on mice (Fleeton 2001; Geall et al. 2012; Magini et al. 2016), ferrets (Brazzoli et al. 2015), pigs (Schnee et al. 2016), monkeys (Brito et al. 2014), and yes, even humans (Craenenbroeck et al. 2015; Bahl 2017; Alberer et al. 2017). As you\u2019d expect in a rapidly growing field, even more studies were published following that review, (but prior to COVID). Feldman et al. (2019), for example tested mRNA influenza vaccines in over 200 people, including following them for a full year after the vaccines to assess safety and effectiveness. Similarly, studies like Alberer et al. (2017) followed patients for a year prior to publishing and continued to follow them after publication.\n\nTo be clear, those human trials were small trials; my point is simply that we were able to develop these COVID vaccines so quickly not by rushing, but rather by utilizing a robust body of research that had already been conducted. All of the information was there, waiting to be applied to something like COVID.\n\nThe way that people (including politicians and the media) are talking about these vaccines, you\u2019d think that they represent totally uncharted territory. Reading the comments on my page, people are acting like we have almost no knowledge about them and are shooting in the dark, recklessly plowing into the unknown, but that\u2019s simply not true. In reality, we knew a ton about mRNA vaccines before COVID, and that should really change your perspective on these vaccines.\n\nIt is so easy to give into fear of the unknown, particularly when you are so constantly bombarded with people\u2019s concerns. I don\u2019t blame anyone for that;\u2019 it\u2019s human nature, but it\u2019s important that we use logic and facts to overcome our base fears, and if you step back and start to rationally look at the wealth of knowledge these vaccines were based on (including human trials spanning a year or more), that really should paint these vaccines in a different light and help to alleviate those fears.\n\nNote that I only cited a small handful of the studies that had been conducted prior to COVID.\n\nWhat we know: proximate (short-term) side effects\n\nThe crux of the concern over these vaccines is fear of the unknown, so before we can talk about the unknown, we need to be clear on what we do know, as well as clearly defining what we mean by \u201cunknown, long-term effects.\u201d\n\nThere are basically two categories of effects we need to talk about:\n\nProximate effects (short-term) = effects that first occur shortly after vaccination\n\nUnknown future effects (long-term) = effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination (Note 1)\n\nIt is important to make this distinction, because I often find that people meander back and forth between these two without having a clear understanding of what is actually known or how it is known. So let me try to be as clear as possible: we have an extremely robust understanding of proximate effects, and the fact that the vaccines are new is 100% irrelevant.\n\nProximate effects are fairly straightforward to test. First, scientists conduct phase 1\u20133 human trials using a randomized, placebo-controlled approach, where they follow thousands of patients for several weeks following vaccination. Then, once the vaccine is released to the general public, scientists continue to monitor it for side effects using things like large cohort studies and case-controlled studies. As the sample sizes increase, so does our ability to detect increasingly rare events. With tens of thousands of participants, we can detect events that occur every few thousand people, but we will miss events that happen once for every 10,000 people. At a few hundred thousand people, we can detect events that occur once per tens of thousands of people, but will miss events that happen once for every 100,000 people, etc. (Note: numbers are approximations).\n\nThere are two critical points here. First, because our ability to detect rare side effects is dependent on sample size, as the sample size increases, any new side effects will, by definition, be increasingly rare. By the time we are into the millions (as we are with COVID vaccines) we aren\u2019t going to suddenly find a new common serious side effect, because those would have been picked up at much smaller sample sizes.\n\nSecond, the novelty of the vaccines is completely and totally irrelevant. Because we are talking about events that happen within a few weeks of being vaccinated, it does not matter if the vaccines have been available for two months or two hundred years. The only thing that matters is the sample size (i.e., number of participants). Let me say that again (in bold), our ability to confidently know the rates of proximate side effects depends entirely on the sample size; the age of the vaccine is 100% irrelevant.\n\nIn the case of COVID, we were able to get these sample sizes extremely quickly because there were so many cases of COVID and governments dumped so much money into massive vaccine campaigns. All of the currently recommended vaccines passed their initial phase 3 trials with large sample sizes. For example, Pfizer used over 43,000 participants (Polack et al. 2020), and Moderna used over 30,000 (Mahase 2020).\n\nFollowing those phase 3 trials, numerous large studies have been released. Indeed, so many studies have been conducted that we can do systematic reviews and meta-analyses. As explained here, these combine the data from multiple studies to look for overarching effects and are the highest level of scientific evidence. Qianhui et al. (2021), for example, included 87 different safety studies, and concluded that, \u201cAvailable evidence indicates that eligible COVID-19 vaccines have an acceptable short-term safety profile.\u201d\n\nYet more studies have been conducted since that review/meta-analysis, and some of them are truly massive. Barda et al. (2021), for example, compared over 800,000 vaccinated individuals to over 800,000 unvaccinated individuals to look at the rates of adverse events from the Pfizer vaccine as well as the rates of those same events in people who develop COVID. Not only did the vaccine have low rates of serious side effects, but, for most conditions (including myocarditis and myocardial infarction), the rates of those events were higher in people who caught COVID than in people who received vaccines (Note 2).\n\nOther calculations of the rates of specific adverse events have had even large sample sizes. For example, the Israel Ministry of Health used over 5 million people to calculate the rate of myocarditis following vaccination. Similarly, in the USA, the CDC has several hundred million vaccine doses to use in its calculations.\n\nThe point is that we are extremely confident about the short-term consequences of the vaccines. It\u2019s hard to overstate the massive volume of data we have. Barda et al. (2021), for example, is one of largest cohort studies I have ever read. It is larger than most studies on the safety of well-established vaccines that have been available for decades. Indeed, we have been able to quickly collect so much data that our knowledge of the short-term safety of COVID vaccines is equal to or greater than our knowledge of the short-term safety of many standard vaccines.\n\nAgain, to be 100% clear, the fact that the vaccines are relatively new simply does not matter for these short-term effects. Further, these studies aren\u2019t the result of \u201crushing.\u201d Rather, it is simply matter of vaccinating so many people so quickly that we were able to rapidly collect the data that would usually take years to accumulate. It is the size and volume of the studies that matters, and we have numerous truly massive studies unequivocally showing that serious side effects are rare and the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nTo put it simply, the short-term side effects of the COVID vaccines have been thoroughly studied and are extremely well-documented. Scientifically, these vaccines are no longer experimental (with the exception of their application to young children, in some cases). They have already passed numerous experiments and the evidence is clear (Pfizer isn\u2019t \u201cexperimental\u201d legally either). Insisting that we haven\u2019t studied the vaccines well-enough to know the short-term side effects is, at this stage, science denial.\n\nSee Note 3 regarding the supposed vaccine-related deaths and injuries reported in VAERS.\n\nVaccines don\u2019t cause wide-spread, long-term adverse events\n\nNow we can finally turn our attention specifically to the topic of unknown, long-term effects (which, remember, are effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination; Note 1). I realize I took a long time getting here, but that background was important, because I have shown that we have a massive body of studies showing that the COVID vaccines have few serious side effects shortly after receiving them. Thus, the only way to doubt their safety without outright science denial is to raise concerns over presently unknown, long-term effects, but, as I will show, those concerns have no scientific merit.\n\nThe type of future long-term consequence that everyone seems so afraid of (i.e., the type that only manifests months or years down the road) is virtually unheard of from vaccines. I looked long and hard for examples of this occurring, and in the entire history of vaccines, I was only able to find one: Pandemrix, an H1N1 vaccine used in Europe for the 2009\u20132010 flu season was associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy that usually only manifested weeks or months after the vaccine. You can read more details on Thoughtscapism and Skeptical Raptor, but there are just three points I want to make.\n\nDepending on the study, the lag between vaccination and onset of narcolepsy was 0-242 days (median = 42; Partinen et al. 2012) or 0-360 days (median not reported; Nohynek et al. 2012). Pfizer and Moderna both began their phase 3 COVID vaccine trials on 27 July 2020 (~400 days ago) and received emergency use authorization (thus starting mass vaccination campaigns in the USA) in December 2020 (~260 days ago). Indeed, Israel had already administered over 1 million doses by the end of 2020. This means we are already past the time frame where we should have started picking up something comparable to the long-term effects of Pandemrix. As is so often the case with vaccine side effects, the disease they prevent (influenza in this case) also causes the same side effect. This side effects was rare (between 1 in 52,000 doses and 1 in 57,500 doses in England [Miller et al. 2013] and 1 in 16,000 in Finland [Nohynek et al. 2012; for unclear reasons, Finland had a high rate that could not be generalized to other countries), and the benefits of the vaccine still outweighed the risk.\n\nThat last point is really important, because for it to turn out that avoiding the COVID vaccines was the safer choice, unknown future side effects would not only have to exist, but they would have to be so common and so serious that they outweigh the enormous known benefits of the vaccines, and that is a situation that has never occurred for any vaccine (Note 4). For reasons that I\u2019ll explain in the next sections, that\u2019s simply not how vaccines interact with the body.\n\nSo, if you are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of a fear of unknown, serious, long-term side effects, ask yourself, is that fear really rational given that future, long-term side effects of vaccines are virtually unheard of, and there has never been a case where those side effects were widespread and outweighed the benefits of the vaccines?\n\nWhy vaccines don\u2019t cause future long-term effects: Low dose, short exposure\n\nLet\u2019s now talk about why vaccine side effects nearly always show up shortly after vaccination. The type of long-term consequence we are talking about typically comes from one of two causes: a very large dose over a short time, or a small dose over a prolonged period of time. Vaccines don\u2019t fit either of those categories. They are fundamentally different from most medications because they simply train your immune system before being quickly removed. Your own immune system is what provides a lasting benefit. Further, vaccines do this via low, non-toxic doses. Remember, the dose makes the poison. Everything, even water (Garigan and Ristedt 1999), is toxic at a high enough dose and safe at a low enough dose. So people who scream about \u201cTOXIC CHEMICALS\u201d in vaccines are ignoring basic chemistry. There is no such thing as a toxic chemical, there are only toxic doses, and the doses in vaccines are not toxic.\n\nOne of the most common arguments I hear people making to justify concerns over COVID vaccines is, \u201clook at all the examples of drugs that were approved, then years later long-term effects were found.\u201d Those examples are, however, nearly always for drugs that were taken repeatedly. It\u2019s the cumulative effect that causes the risk (particularly for chemicals that persist in your body for long periods of time). Vaccines, in contrast, have limited exposure, and your body quickly eliminates them. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, the vaccine itself has been totally eliminated from your body. The long-term protection comes from immune system memory, not from the vaccines themselves.\n\nThis is really important, because it means we don\u2019t have a mechanism through which COVID vaccines would cause long-term harm. Because vaccines are a low doses given 2-3 times, we expect any consequences to happen quickly, which is exactly what we find. The most common side effects are things like soreness and moderate flu symptoms that start within a few hours or days of receiving the vaccine. These effects aren\u2019t because the vaccine is \u201ctoxic\u201d but rather because it is doing exactly what it was designed to do and stimulating your immune system. It\u2019s that activation of your immune system that makes you feel unwell, but that activation is critical, because it is how your immune system learns to identify and fight COVID. Similarly, serious side effects from the vaccines, while rare, usually show up shortly after vaccination.\n\nSide effects that don\u2019t show up for months or years simply aren\u2019t expected from vaccines because of how vaccines work. Nevertheless, in the following sections, let\u2019s look more closely at the three main hypothetical sources of long-term harm: adjuvants/preservatives, mRNA, and immune activation.\n\n#1: Adjuvants and preservatives\n\nVaccines typical consist of three basic components: a representation of the infectious agent (antigens, weakened viruses, virus particles, mRNA, etc.), an adjuvant that simulates the immune system and/or aids in delivery of the antigen, mRNA, etc., and preservatives (usually salts, metals, and sugars) to avoid contamination and stabilize the other components.\n\nThe later two categories (adjuvants and preservatives) are historically the things that anti-vaccers have targeted (e.g., the infamous, and completely false, accusation that thimerosal [ethyl-mercury] caused autism). These accusations have, however, never stood up to scrutiny. Vaccine components have been well-studied and are safe at the doses used in vaccines.\n\nSpecifically for COVID vaccines, their components differ from one vaccine to the next, but the safety of the components is well-known. Many of them use standard salts/metals that have been used in numerous previous vaccines and medications, and the non-mRNA vaccines usually use the adjuvants that have already been used in other vaccines.\n\nSpecifically for the mRNA vaccines, they use a different type of antigen known as a \u201clipid nanoparticle\u201d (basically a small, fancy fat) that stimulates the immune system and serves as a delivery mechanism for the mRNA. These are new for a commercially available vaccines (because we\u2019ve never had commercially available mRNA vaccines before), but that doesn\u2019t make the nanoparticles themselves new, and there is a wealth of studies on them (including studies on other vaccines that have been being developed [see previous section on the history of mRNA vaccines]). See Hou et al. (2021) for an extensive review of the topic.\n\nMy point is simply that while the vaccines are \u201cnew,\u201d their components have been well-studied, and there is simply no reason to think that they pose a long-term danger.\n\n#2: mRNA\n\nNow let\u2019s turn our attention to the big one that has so many people worried: mRNA. At the outset, we need to be clear on what mRNA is and which it does. Your cells contain DNA stored in the nucleus. This provides the plans for your body and how it runs, and it is what you pass on to make your offspring when you procreate. For the actual day-to-day running of your body, however, it has to be transcribed into mRNA (aka \u201cmessenger RNA\u201d). This is a single stranded copy of your double-stranded DNA. The mRNA can then leave the nucleus and go to the ribosomes (little protein factories in your cells) which translate the mRNA into amino acids which are then strung together and folded to form proteins. This is happing millions of times in your body each second. Importantly, the process does not alter your DNA. Your genetic code is unaffected. Think of it like taking a master copy of a recipe, photocopying it, then giving that photocopy to someone who then follows the instructions on it.\n\nViruses are actually pretty neat and replicate by tapping into this system. They can\u2019t reproduce on their own. Instead, they insert their DNA or RNA into your cells and hijack your molecular machinery by making the ribosomes translate their RNA and build new virus (some viruses have DNA and require a transcription step, others [like COVID] store their genetic material as RNA).\n\nThe mRNA vaccines tap into this same process. They include a small fragment of the RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus (specifically for the spike protein), thus causing your cells to produce that spike protein. Your immune system is then stimulated to attack the spike protein, and in the process, it learns to attack the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus. Take a minute to stop and marvel at the ingenuity of this system, because it\u2019s incredible.\n\nThere are several important points that need to be made here:\n\nThis process does not alter your DNA. The viral mRNA does not get integrated into your DNA. This is not gene therapy. All that happens is protein production by ribosomes. Again, this is like handing your cells a photocopy of a set of instructions. mRNA is a very fragile, short-lived molecule. During my PhD, I worked in a laboratory where some people do RNA research, and they often joked that if you looked at the vials the wrong way the RNA would vanish. The point is that the mRNA from the vaccines very quickly breaks down and is removed from your body. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, it is totally gone. The vaccines only contain the mRNA for a single protein. It is impossible for them to cause your body to make the full virus. They simply don\u2019t contain that information. This is a process that is already happening constantly in your body. Right now, you almost certainly have some viruses (even if you are healthy), and those viruses are hijacking your cells with their RNA and forcing your cells to make virus for them. Indeed, unlike with the vaccine, they are making your body produce entire viruses, not just a single protein. Similarly, anytime you become infected with a cold, the flu, etc., your body is exposed to tons of viral RNA which it then translates into proteins (entire viruses) (related to #4) If you become infected with COVID, this process is going to happen anyway, but unlike with the vaccine, your cells are going to produce the entire virus, and, because the virus will be replicating, you will be exposed to substantially more viral RNA for a longer period of time.\n\nThat last point is incredibly important, because it means that any fears you have about the mRNA in the vaccine should be even greater for the virus itself. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to simultaneously downplay the seriousness of COVID while fearing the mRNA in the vaccines, because if you catch COVID, you are going to be exposed to substantially higher doses of viral RNA!\n\nAs you can hopefully see, none of this lends credence to the idea that the vaccine will cause long-term effects. There is simply no mechanism through which the mRNA could cause long-term harm, and even if there was a concern over long-term effects, that concern would be even higher from actually catching COVID!\n\n#3. Immune activation\n\nThe final way in which vaccines could, in concept, cause harm is as a side effect of the inflammatory immune response they stimulate. Indeed, that is the cause of most vaccine side effects. The vaccine sets off a cascade of immune responses, and sometimes your body gets caught in the crossfire, though this rarely causes serious problems.\n\nImportantly, however, this happens while your immune system is being stimulated. This isn\u2019t a pathway that we would expect to not cause any noticeable problems shortly after vaccination, then suddenly cause massive problems down the road. It could, in concept, cause a problem that starts shortly after vaccination and persists long-term, but it\u2019s unlikely to cause problems that don\u2019t appear until months or years later.\n\nThis is important because, again, problems that arise shortly after vaccination and persist aren\u2019t what we are talking about. Those aren\u2019t unknown. Rather, we already know that those are rare because we can detect them shortly after vaccination (see previous section on short-term studies).\n\nFinally, as I\u2019ve alluded to several times already, problems that arise as a result of immune activation should also arise as the result of actual infection with SARS-CoV-2, and they\u2019d usually be expected to be worse or more common from an actual infection. Indeed, that\u2019s exactly what Barda et al. (2021) found.\n\nSo, once again, it makes no sense to fear this as a consequence of the vaccine while downplaying the seriousness of COVID, because infection with COVID is more likely to cause this problem (see Note 2 on absolute risk).\n\nHow long is long enough?\n\nThis is an issue that I\u2019ve written about several times before (e.g., here and here), but in short, the demand for long-term data becomes extremely problematic unless \u201clong-term\u201d is carefully defined and justified beforehand. We already have over a year of data on COVID vaccines, plus many years of data on mRNA vaccines more generally. For most scientists, based on everything we know, that is plenty long enough to be confident in the safety of these vaccines, but if you are going to claim that it is not long enough, the questions become \u201cwhy?\u201d and \u201chow long is long enough?\u201d\n\nAs I said earlier, anti-vacces have used this argument against vaccines for ages, and the problem is that they constantly shift the goal posts. If you show them a 3-year study, they say, \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 5 years.\u201d If you show them a 5-year study, they say \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 10 years.\u201d If you show them a 10-year study, they switch to 15 years, 20 years, etc. They can keep extending it all the way until the end of the human life-span, and beyond the fact that continually shifting the goal posts is an ad hoc fallacy (and this whole thing is an argument from ignorance fallacy), demanding 15 years of data is only slightly more irrational than demanding 10 years, or even 5 years or 3 years.\n\nReally think about this. Given that no vaccine has ever had a wide-spread, serious side effect that only shows up more than a year after vaccination, what is the justification for demanding 3 years of data instead of accepting the year+ of data we have? How is the demand for 3 years of data more logical than a demand for 10 years, or 20 years, or 60 years? All of those are time categories where we\u2019ve never seen a vaccine suddenly cause new problems and for which we have zero reason to expect these vaccines to cause problems. The probability of a long-term effect only showing up over a year after vaccination is pretty close to zero, which means that it is close to zero for 3 years, 5 years, etc.\n\nBad risk assessment\n\nAs I\u2019ve shown throughout this post, there is simply no good evidence to suggest that the COVID vaccines will have serious long-term consequences that only show up in the future. It\u2019s a baseless fear. Meanwhile, we know that COVID itself is very serious. In the USA alone, it has killed over 650,000 people. In 2020, it was the third leading cause of death in the USA, and in early 2021, it briefly spiked to the #1 slot before dropping back to position #3. We should not be downplaying something that is so prevalent and deadly that it is the third leading cause of death. Further, beyond death, many people suffer serious complications from COVID, some of which will likely persist into the future (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020).\n\nTherefore, based on everything we know (which is a lot), risk assessment clearly shows that you are safer with the vaccine than without it, and while it is technically possible that there will be future unknown consequences of the vaccine, these would be even more likely from COVID itself, and it is incredibly unlikely that they will happen from the vaccines and be serious and widespread enough to alter the risk assessment.\n\nBy avoiding the vaccine, you are placing more weight on an unknown and unlikely hypothetical future risk than you are placing on a very real and serious known risk.\n\nSee the following posts for more details including the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument, precautionary principle argument, and COVID comorbidities.\n\nLong-term fears are baseless: The burden of proof\n\nAs I\u2019ve explained throughout, there is not one shred of evidence nor a single logical argument that makes it likely that the vaccines will have unknown long-term consequences. This is a completely made-up concern. This isn\u2019t a situation where we have preliminary data suggesting a concern, or a logical/scientific basis for thinking that there is a risk. Rather, this is a concern that was pulled out of thin air with absolutely no evidence behind it.\n\nFurther, to be clear, the fact that something is new does not make it likely that there are unknown long-term effects. Indeed, everything we know about vaccines and the immune system makes it extremely unlikely that there will be future, unknown, wide-spread, long-term consequences. Is it technically possible? Sure, but there are an infinite number of technically possible things that will probably never happen. \u201cTechnically possible\u201d is not a valid justification for a fear, particularly if that fear will prevent you from taking a medication that greatly lowers your risk of disease and death.\n\nFor future unknown consequences to be a logically valid reason for not vaccinating, the probability of serious consequences occurring would need to be high enough to trump the massive known benefits of the vaccines. We would need some really compelling preliminary evidence to suggest that these future injuries will occur, and we simply don\u2019t have it, not one scrap of it.\n\nI say again, this is a made-up concern. Although it makes a certain amount of sense from the standpoint of the psychology of our panicky primate brains, it is a concern that is not based on any evidence or logic. You can\u2019t just make up a concern, then demand action based on that concern. You need actual evidence to support the concern.\n\nIn medicine (and science more generally), it is not enough to simply say that something is technically possible. Rather, you have to show that there is a reasonable probability of it being true before it makes sense to treat it seriously (this is something known as the \u201cprior probability\u201d).\n\nImagine, for example, that I decide that taking aspirin while drinking soda is dangerous, and when asked to justify that fear, I simply say, \u201cwell we don\u2019t know that it isn\u2019t dangerous. It\u2019s technically possible that it\u2019s dangerous, and look at how many drugs have been recalled because of some complication with another chemical.\u201d\n\nI think that we can all agree that my fear would be irrational, right? In technical terms, it would be an argument from ignorance fallacy. The fact that something is unknown, doesn\u2019t mean that I can act as if that thing is known to be dangerous. There are an infinite number of things that are unknown. There are an infinite number of potential interactions and long-term effects for all treatments, including vitamins, supplements, herbs, etc. There haven\u2019t been, for example, any 30-year studies on the effects of regularly taking most vitamins or supplements, and given that those are taken daily, they are far more likely to cause long-term issues. So why not be concerned about them?\n\nDo you see the point that I am getting at here? The fact that we haven\u2019t looked at 3-year effects of the vaccines (or 5 years, or 10 years, etc.) would only matter if we actually had evidence to suggest that there would be problems down the road, and we don\u2019t have that evidence. Indeed, all of the evidence suggests the opposite. Therefore, this is a baseless fear and the burden of proof is on those who are avoiding the vaccine based on these concerns.\n\nNow you could try to quibble with me and say that, \u201cNo one is saying that there definitely are long-term effects. We are just saying that we don\u2019t know if there are and, therefore, we should not take the vaccine until we do know.\u201d But, again, that doesn\u2019t work for all the reasons that I\u2019ve laid out. A lack of knowledge simply isn\u2019t sufficient in and of itself. This is an abuse of the precautionary principle, and although you may not be claiming that there are, in fact, long term effects, by choosing to avoid the vaccines, you are, nevertheless, acting as if there will be those effects. As explained earlier, that\u2019s bad risk assessment.\n\nI want to conclude this with some questions. If you are not vaccinating because of concerns over unknown long-term effects, ask yourself, \u201cwhy do I have those concerns?\u201d Can you point to any actual data to justify them, or is it simply a fear of the unknown? If the latter, ask yourself how likely it is that those fears will come true. The fact that something is new or unknown doesn\u2019t make it dangerous. Given the very real risk of COVID, the decade+ of research on mRNA vaccines, the decades of research on vaccines in general, the massive studies on the COVID vaccines, and the fact that no vaccine has ever had the type of serious, widespread, unknown, long-term side effect that everyone is so afraid of, does it really make rational sense to avoid the vaccines out of fear of the unknown? Does it really seem more likely that you will be injured by this totally hypothetical and unprecedented vaccine injury than by a virus that is currently the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA?\n\nNotes\n\nNote 1: When we talk about unknown long-term effects, we are not talking about adverse events that happen shortly after vaccination and continue to cause problems into the future (those are proximate events that have long-term consequences). We aren\u2019t talking about something like myocarditis which, in rare cases, occurs shortly after vaccination and (in a small subset of the most extreme cases) can cause long-term damage. We already know that those events are extremely rare, because we\u2019ve already been able to detect them. They aren\u2019t unknown. In other words, because those events are first detected shortly after vaccination, we have been able to test them with the current short-term studies and have shown that they are extremely rare.\n\nNote 2: Barda et al. (2021) was comparing rates among the vaccinated with rates among the infected, not absolute risk. Absolute risk depends on how likely you are to become infected. However, other analyses (e.g., Gargano et al. 2021) have shown that in high-risk countries like the USA, your absolute risk of serious injury and death is lower with the vaccine than without it, even if you are in a low-risk COVID group.\n\nNote 3: There are many false claims floating around about thousands of deaths following vaccination. These claims are based on VAERS which includes anything observed following vaccination and does not establish causation. With millions of people receiving vaccines, it is inevitable that a few thousand will die shortly afterwards just by chance. In the vast majority of cases, there is simply no reason to think that the vaccines were responsible. Similarly, while some of the adverse events reported in VAERS may have been caused by vaccines, most probably weren\u2019t. The database is self-reported (anyone can make entries), and some truly wacky submissions have been included. Further, again, the fact that something happened after vaccination absolutely does not mean that the vaccine caused it (that\u2019s a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy; more details here and here). To quote the CDC \u201cFDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it\u2019s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines\u201d (the bold was in the original). More details on VAERS here.\n\nNote 4: Again, to be 100% clear, we are talking about injuries that won\u2019t show up until later down the road. You certainly can find examples from decades ago where there were issues with a vaccine rollout (particularly concerning polio vaccines), but those issues were immediate, and that\u2019s not what we are talking about here. The COVID vaccines all underwent massive randomized controlled trials and have been carefully monitored following release to the public, and with the hundreds of millions of doses that we have administered, we have a very clear picture of the immediate risks and benefits. Those aren\u2019t unknowns.\n\nRelated posts\n\nLiterature cited",
        "Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the argument that \u201c99% of COVID patients survive\u201d has been repeatedly used as an excuse to oppose public health measures including mask mandates, lockdowns, and, more recently, vaccines. It asserts that because COVID has a ~99% survivorship, is not really that big of a concern and vaccines, masks, lockdowns, etc. are not needed.\n\nThere are many issues with this argument, but before I talk specifically about COVID-19, I want to discuss a hypothetical disease. Imagine that the majority of people who become infected with this hypothetical disease are fine. Roughly 70% of people are asymptomatic. Really serious consequences that could alter the rest of the victim\u2019s life only occur in about 0.5% of cases, and over 99.5% of patients make a full recovery. Actual mortality is even lower. The exact number varies, but even on the high end, over 99.9% people survive.\n\nNow, when I present this hypothetical disease like that, it probably doesn\u2019t sound that bad. Simply giving you those numbers without any additional context makes the disease sound pretty benign, and you might be tempted to use this \u201c>99% live\u201d argument and argue that we don\u2019t really need a massive vaccine push and should just wait for natural herd immunity.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing though. I lied when I said this was a hypothetical disease. Those are the stats for polio (CDC Pinkbook), a notoriously horrible disease that was once a scourge on our planet causing thousands of cases of paralysis and even death. It is a disease that, thanks to vaccines, we very rightly sent into oblivion in nearly every part of the world. If, however, instead of using vaccines, we had listened to this \u201c99% live\u201d argument, we would still have polio in countries like the USA, and children would still be getting infected, paralyzed, and even killed by this disease. Ninety-nine percent survival is not as high as it sounds, nor is it the only factor that has to be considered, but it can sound very persuasive when it is presented without the other necessary pieces of information.\n\nPlease, keep this in mind as we now turn our attention to COVID. If you are tempted to dismiss the severity of COVID or the necessity of vaccines because COVID \u201conly\u201d kills 1% of patients, keep in mind that polio \u201conly\u201d paralyzed 0.5% of its victims and killed less than 0.1%.\n\nNote: The actual COVID case fatality rate is affected by many factors (e.g., age). As such, it is far more complicated than a simple \u201c99%,\u201d and you should not confuse that number with the notion that you personally have a 99% chance of survival. Nevertheless, 99% is the number I keep seeing people use, and it is a rough approximation of an average for many parts of the world, so for simplicity, I will continue using it here.\n\nInfection prevalence matters\n\nOne of the key problems with the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it completely ignores the importance of transmissibility and infection prevalence (i.e., how easily a disease can spread). You see, a disease can be a serious threat to a population (in terms of mortality) either by having a high case fatality rate (i.e., killing a large percentage of patients) or by being highly contagious (i.e., infecting a large number of people), and case fatality rates can be very misleading by themselves.\n\nConsider, for example, two hypothetical diseases (A and B). A has an extremely high case fatality rate of 100%, but it is not very contagious and has a very low prevalence in the population. Only about 1 in 1 million people will catch it. In contrast, disease B has a much lower case fatality rate (1%), but is extremely contagious, and about 1 in 10 people will catch it.\n\nThis means that in a population of 10 million people, disease A will kill 10 people, whereas disease B will kill 10 thousand people! So, which of those diseases should you be more concerned about? Obviously disease B is more concerning, right? You are at a higher risk of dying form disease B, even though 99% of patients survive. Why? Because it is so common.\n\nIf you admit this basic fact, that disease B would be more concerning than disease A, then you have just admitted that case fatality rate is not sufficient in and of itself to tell you how concerning a disease is. If we had relied only on case fatalities, we would have incorrectly concluded that disease A was the bigger risk. This clearly demonstrates that the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is not a good argument, because we have to look at other factors besides just survivorship (the opposite of case fatalities), and even a disease with a 99% survival rate can be very dangerous to both populations at large and you personally if it is highly contagious.\n\nTo put it simply, when considering risk, you need to consider both how likely you are to be infected, and how likely you are to die (or suffer serious consequences) if you are infected.\n\nIn the case of COVID19, a large part of why it is so dangerous is its high rate of transmission, with new variants like the Delta strain making the situation even worse. That is why it has been able to kill over 4 million people world-wide, with over 600,000 deaths in the US alone.\n\nThose are sobering numbers, which should really make you stop and think long and hard about the veracity of the \u201c99% survival\u201d argument. To me, it seems self-evident that a disease that has already killed over 600,000 people in the US alone is a serious problem that merits something like a massive vaccination campaign, and the argument that the disease is not dangerous/doesn\u2019t merit vaccines is clearly flawed.\n\nIndeed, in 2020, COVID was the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA, behind only cancer and heart disease (Ahmad and Anderson 2021), and in early 2021, it spiked to the #1 cause of death in the US (a situation that is no longer the case thanks in part to vaccines). That\u2019s what COVID looks like when it is not controlled by measures like vaccines, and it should be abundantly apparent from that situation that simply having a 99% survival rate does not mean that a disease isn\u2019t a serious threat. Indeed, if you are going to argue that we don\u2019t need to be that worried about COVID 19, then you had better make that same argument about literally every other cause of death, because when allowed to spread, COVID kills more than any of them (or if you want to arbitrarily restrict yourself to the 2020 data, you\u2019d better make that argument about every cause of death other than cancer and heart disease).\n\nTo put all of that another way, a 99% survival rate is only comforting if the spread of the disease is being controlled by something like vaccines. A 99% survival rate without vaccines still results in hundreds of thousands of people dying. That is a simple fact.\n\nNatural herd immunity is a misnomer\n\nProponents of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument often say that we will eventually achieve natural herd immunity, at which point people will be protected even without vaccines. Let me briefly explain why that is a terrible idea.\n\nThe term \u201cherd immunity\u201d really only makes sense within the context of vaccines. Vaccine-induced herd immunity = a population that is protected from a disease. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d = a survivorship bias in which the survivors of the outbreak are protected from future infection and many previous herd members died. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d is a bloodbath. It\u2019s a nonsense term.\n\nEstimates for what it would take to achieve herd immunity to COVID vary, but even at the (probably) unrealistically low end of 60% immune, getting there in the US without vaccines would involve the deaths of roughly 2 million Americans! At what is probably the more realistic threshold of 90% immune, without vaccines, we are looking at about ~3 million dead Americans.\n\nThat\u2019s not herd immunity; that\u2019s herd culling. Alternatively, we can achieve actual herd immunity with vaccines without killing 2\u20133 million people.\n\nDisease risk is more than just death\n\nOne of the many deceptive aspects of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it acts as if COVID infection is a strictly binary situation: either you die or you are totally fine. That is, however, a completely false dichotomy. Since when is death the only outcome we care about? Many people who catch COVID live, but still undergo tremendous suffering physically, mentally, and financially. When we are considering the risks and benefits of something like a vaccine for COVID, we should not just look at whether or not you are likely to die. Things like time off work and physical suffering matter.\n\nThere is a vast spectrum of responses from \u201ctotally fine\u201d to \u201calive, but extreme suffering (and in the US, often financial difficulty).\u201d Good estimates of hospitalization rates are a bit hard to come by, and are usually expressed in terms of rate per population size, not rate per infection, but by taking the cumulative overall hospitalization rate per 100,000 people from the CDC, the US population size, and the cumulative cases in the US, we find that roughly 5% of COVID cases result in hospitalizations. A scientific study using more sophisticated methods provides a similar estimate of 4.5% (Reese et al. 2020) [note: as with the case fatality rate, these are crude rates for the whole population and actual rates vary by age group]. Indeed, COVID is so rampant, that roughly 0.5% of the entire US population has been hospitalized for it. That\u2019s actually an incredible number. One out of every 200 people in America has been hospitalized for COVID (again if we average across the population), and that\u2019s just actual hospitalizations, many more have been at home sick, took time off work, etc.\n\nFurther, the complications from the disease can be serious. COVID can set off a cytokine storm that affects multiple of your body\u2019s major systems. It\u2019s too early to know exactly what that means long-term, but based on what we know about COVID and other viral diseases, there is good reason to be concerned that many people who survive will have long-term lung and heart issues (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). To be clear, we need to wait for more data before knowing for sure if there will be long-term complications, but the reasonably high probability that there will be is certainly something to think about when considering the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and it\u2019s something that is completely ignored by this unreasonably simplistic \u201c99% survive\u201d argument.\n\nVaccines: benefits outweigh the risks\n\nFinally, let\u2019s briefly turn our attention to the COVID vaccines. This would take many posts to cover in proper detail, so I\u2019ll try to be brief and just hit the key points.\n\nAll vaccines have side effects, but serious side effects are rare, and your risk of a getting COVID and having a serious complication from it is much higher than your risk of a serious complication from vaccines. Countries with large vaccination programs (e.g., Israel; Rossman et al. 2020) are seeing massive drops in COVID infection, hospitalization, and death rates thanks to vaccines, and there has not been a comparable increase in injuries, hospitalizations, and deaths from vaccines. In other words, the vaccines are reducing risk.\n\nIn the USA, an analysis of data in May (by which time roughly 40% of the country had received both doses of the vaccine and 50% had at least one dose) found that out of over 107,000 COVID hospitalizations, fewer than 1,200 were for vaccinated individuals, and out of 18,000 COVID deaths, only ~150 of them were for vaccinated individuals. In other words, over 99% of COVID deaths were from unvaccinated individuals, as were nearly 99% of COVID hospitalizations. That trend has continued, and now with over half the country fully vaccinated, officials like Dr. Fauci are likewise reporting that over 99% of COVID deaths and over 97% of COVID hospitalizations are from the unvaccinated. The vaccines clearly work.\n\nFurther, we have not seen hospitalization or mortality rates from vaccine side effects rising to meet those numbers. In other words, with roughly half the population vaccinated, if the vaccine was truly more dangerous than the disease, we should see vaccine deaths and serious injuries at a rate that exceeds the rate for COVID. So where are the >18,000 individuals in May who died from the vaccine? Where are the >100,000 hospitalizations from the vaccine? They don\u2019t exist, because serious side effects are extremely rare.\n\nThis clearly shows that your total risk is lower with the vaccine than without it. These numbers make that undeniable. Yes, the disease has a ~99% survival, and yes, the vaccine does have side effects, but the disease is exceptionally common, and series side effects of the vaccine are exceptionally rare, which, when taken together, results in your risk of serious injury or death being substantially lower when you have the vaccine.\n\nJust to really drive this home, let\u2019s look specifically at myocarditis following the mRNA vaccines. It is still not entirely clear if this is actually a side effect of the vaccines, but there is growing evidence that it is causal. Exact rates vary, but every calculation shows them to be low (Shay et al. 2021). A large data set from Israel reported a mere 148 cases within 30 days of vaccination out of over 5 million people who were vaccinated (Israel Ministry of Health). Even if all of those were caused by the vaccine, that would be a rate of 0.003%! Further, 95% of those cases were mild.\n\nIn the USA, with over 150 million people vaccinated, using data from VAERS (much of which has not been verified), the WHO calculated the following myocarditis rates per fully vaccinated individual: 0.041% for males aged 12\u201329, 0.004% for females aged 12\u201329, and 0.002% for males and females over 29. Further, again, most of those cases were mild and did not require serious medical intervention. I have not so far seen any confirmed deaths from this. In contrast, COVID has a case fatality rate of ~1%.\n\nNow, I hear you saying, \u201cbut I am a male under 30, which means I\u2019m at a low risk of death from COVID and higher risk of myocarditis, so for me the risk outweighs the benefit,\u201d however, that math still doesn\u2019t work. From the start of the outbreak in the US (based on the current CDC data), there have been 2,462 deaths from COVID in males under 30, and 1,594 deaths in females under 30. There is no evidence to suggest that the vaccines are causing comparable carnage.\n\nScientists actually ran the numbers on this and calculated that for males under 30, every 1 million second doses of an mRNA vaccine will result in 39\u201347 cases of myocarditis, but will prevent 11,000 COVID cases, 560 hospitalizations, 138 ICU admissions, and 6 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021). Also, remember again that most of these myocarditis cases are mild, whereas for COVID, even just the expected number of ICU admissions is 3 times the number of mostly mild myocarditis cases! Further, that is for a group with a relatively low COVID risk and relatively high myocarditis risk. The benefits of the vaccine are even more exaggerated for other groups. In men over 29, for example, 1 million second doses will only result in 3\u20134 cases of myocarditis, and will prevent 15,300 COVID cases, 4,598 hospitalizations, 1,242 ICU admissions, and 700 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021)!\n\nAlso, notice how those who like to cast aspersions on vaccines try to downplay death from COVID while hyping mostly mild injury from the vaccine. Indeed, this \u201c99% survive\u201d argument would have us believe that a 1% fatality is too low to be seriously concerned, but a 0.002\u20130.041% rate of generally mild myocarditis is unacceptably high. It is crazy to think that 3\u20134 mostly mild cases of myocarditis is worse than 700 deaths! That\u2019s simply not how math works.\n\nThe numbers are undeniable: your personal risk* is lower with the vaccine than without the vaccine, even though \u201c99% of people survive.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been focusing on the concerns around Pfizer and Moderna because those are the prominent vaccines where most of my readers are, but we can do the same sorts of calculations with any of the vaccines currently available. They all have various risks, but in every case, the risks associate with not getting the vaccine outweigh the risks associated with getting it.\n\n*Obviously some people have pre-existing conditions that make vaccines dangerous for them. That is not what I am talking about here. I am addressing people who have no known health conditions that would prevent them from getting the vaccine.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument completely ignores the high prevalence of COVID and completely ignores the importance of non-lethal effects (including hospitalization, possibly long-term effects, time off work, etc.). Further, using this argument against the necessity for vaccines massively and inappropriately downplays the risk from COVID while exaggerating the risks from vaccines. The empirical reality is that COVID is very dangerous, with over 600,000 dead in the US alone, whereas the vaccines are very safe. Given that over 50% of the US population is currently vaccinated, if the vaccines were truly more dangerous than the risk from getting COVID, we\u2019d expect the rates of vaccine deaths and serious injuries to be surpassing the rates of deaths and serious injuries from COVID. In reality we are, of course, not seeing anything even remotely like that. Deaths and serious injury from COVID remain common in the unvaccinated, whereas serious injuries from the vaccines are extremely rare and deaths virtually unheard of.\n\nI think part of the problem is that we often view taking an action as the inherently riskier choice. After all, you can\u2019t get myocarditis from the vaccine if you never get the vaccine. That reasoning, while understandable, ignores the fact that not getting the vaccine is also an action, and that action puts you at a much greater risk of death or serious illness. Indeed, that risk from COVID is so great, and the risk from vaccines is so small, that even if you are young and healthy, the risk associated with not getting the vaccine is far higher than the risk associated with getting the vaccine. This is a mathematical fact.\n\nPlease read this post before making an argument about \u201cunknown long-term effects\u201d from vaccines.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nLiterature Cited",

At what is probably the more realistic threshold of 90% immune, without vaccines, we are looking at about ~3 million dead Americans.\n\nThat\u2019s not herd immunity; that\u2019s herd culling. Alternatively, we can achieve actual herd immunity with vaccines without killing 2\u20133 million people.\n\nDisease risk is more than just death\n\nOne of the many deceptive aspects of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it acts as if COVID infection is a strictly binary situation: either you die or you are totally fine. That is, however, a completely false dichotomy. Since when is death the only outcome we care about? Many people who catch COVID live, but still undergo tremendous suffering physically, mentally, and financially. When we are considering the risks and benefits of something like a vaccine for COVID, we should not just look at whether or not you are likely to die. Things like time off work and physical suffering matter.\n\nThere is a vast spectrum of responses from \u201ctotally fine\u201d to \u201calive, but extreme suffering (and in the US, often financial difficulty).\u201d Good estimates of hospitalization rates are a bit hard to come by, and are usually expressed in terms of rate per population size, not rate per infection, but by taking the cumulative overall hospitalization rate per 100,000 people from the CDC, the US population size, and the cumulative cases in the US, we find that roughly 5% of COVID cases result in hospitalizations. A scientific study using more sophisticated methods provides a similar estimate of 4.5% (Reese et al. 2020) [note: as with the case fatality rate, these are crude rates for the whole population and actual rates vary by age group]. Indeed, COVID is so rampant, that roughly 0.5% of the entire US population has been hospitalized for it. That\u2019s actually an incredible number. One out of every 200 people in America has been hospitalized for COVID (again if we average across the population), and that\u2019s just actual hospitalizations, many more have been at home sick, took time off work, etc.\n\nFurther, the complications from the disease can be serious. COVID can set off a cytokine storm that affects multiple of your body\u2019s major systems. It\u2019s too early to know exactly what that means long-term, but based on what we know about COVID and other viral diseases, there is good reason to be concerned that many people who survive will have long-term lung and heart issues (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). To be clear, we need to wait for more data before knowing for sure if there will be long-term complications, but the reasonably high probability that there will be is certainly something to think about when considering the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and it\u2019s something that is completely ignored by this unreasonably simplistic \u201c99% survive\u201d argument.\n\nVaccines: benefits outweigh the risks\n\nFinally, let\u2019s briefly turn our attention to the COVID vaccines. This would take many posts to cover in proper detail, so I\u2019ll try to be brief and just hit the key points.\n\nAll vaccines have side effects, but serious side effects are rare, and your risk of a getting COVID and having a serious complication from it is much higher than your risk of a serious complication from vaccines. Countries with large vaccination programs (e.g., Israel; Rossman et al. 2020) are seeing massive drops in COVID infection, hospitalization, and death rates thanks to vaccines, and there has not been a comparable increase in injuries, hospitalizations, and deaths from vaccines. In other words, the vaccines are reducing risk.\n\nIn the USA, an analysis of data in May (by which time roughly 40% of the country had received both doses of the vaccine and 50% had at least one dose) found that out of over 107,000 COVID hospitalizations, fewer than 1,200 were for vaccinated individuals, and out of 18,000 COVID deaths, only ~150 of them were for vaccinated individuals. In other words, over 99% of COVID deaths were from unvaccinated individuals, as were nearly 99% of COVID hospitalizations. That trend has continued, and now with over half the country fully vaccinated, officials like Dr. Fauci are likewise reporting that over 99% of COVID deaths and over 97% of COVID hospitalizations are from the unvaccinated. The vaccines clearly work.\n\nFurther, we have not seen hospitalization or mortality rates from vaccine side effects rising to meet those numbers. In other words, with roughly half the population vaccinated, if the vaccine was truly more dangerous than the disease, we should see vaccine deaths and serious injuries at a rate that exceeds the rate for COVID. So where are the >18,000 individuals in May who died from the vaccine? Where are the >100,000 hospitalizations from the vaccine? They don\u2019t exist, because serious side effects are extremely rare.\n\nThis clearly shows that your total risk is lower with the vaccine than without it. These numbers make that undeniable. Yes, the disease has a ~99% survival, and yes, the vaccine does have side effects, but the disease is exceptionally common, and series side effects of the vaccine are exceptionally rare, which, when taken together, results in your risk of serious injury or death being substantially lower when you have the vaccine.\n\nJust to really drive this home, let\u2019s look specifically at myocarditis following the mRNA vaccines. It is still not entirely clear if this is actually a side effect of the vaccines, but there is growing evidence that it is causal. Exact rates vary, but every calculation shows them to be low (Shay et al. 2021). A large data set from Israel reported a mere 148 cases within 30 days of vaccination out of over 5 million people who were vaccinated (Israel Ministry of Health). Even if all of those were caused by the vaccine, that would be a rate of 0.003%! Further, 95% of those cases were mild.\n\nIn the USA, with over 150 million people vaccinated, using data from VAERS (much of which has not been verified), the WHO calculated the following myocarditis rates per fully vaccinated individual: 0.041% for males aged 12\u201329, 0.004% for females aged 12\u201329, and 0.002% for males and females over 29. Further, again, most of those cases were mild and did not require serious medical intervention. I have not so far seen any confirmed deaths from this. In contrast, COVID has a case fatality rate of ~1%.\n\nNow, I hear you saying, \u201cbut I am a male under 30, which means I\u2019m at a low risk of death from COVID and higher risk of myocarditis, so for me the risk outweighs the benefit,\u201d however, that math still doesn\u2019t work. From the start of the outbreak in the US (based on the current CDC data), there have been 2,462 deaths from COVID in males under 30, and 1,594 deaths in females under 30. There is no evidence to suggest that the vaccines are causing comparable carnage.\n\nScientists actually ran the numbers on this and calculated that for males under 30, every 1 million second doses of an mRNA vaccine will result in 39\u201347 cases of myocarditis, but will prevent 11,000 COVID cases, 560 hospitalizations, 138 ICU admissions, and 6 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021). Also, remember again that most of these myocarditis cases are mild, whereas for COVID, even just the expected number of ICU admissions is 3 times the number of mostly mild myocarditis cases! Further, that is for a group with a relatively low COVID risk and relatively high myocarditis risk. The benefits of the vaccine are even more exaggerated for other groups. In men over 29, for example, 1 million second doses will only result in 3\u20134 cases of myocarditis, and will prevent 15,300 COVID cases, 4,598 hospitalizations, 1,242 ICU admissions, and 700 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021)!\n\nAlso, notice how those who like to cast aspersions on vaccines try to downplay death from COVID while hyping mostly mild injury from the vaccine. Indeed, this \u201c99% survive\u201d argument would have us believe that a 1% fatality is too low to be seriously concerned, but a 0.002\u20130.041% rate of generally mild myocarditis is unacceptably high. It is crazy to think that 3\u20134 mostly mild cases of myocarditis is worse than 700 deaths! That\u2019s simply not how math works.\n\nThe numbers are undeniable: your personal risk* is lower with the vaccine than without the vaccine, even though \u201c99% of people survive.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been focusing on the concerns around Pfizer and Moderna because those are the prominent vaccines where most of my readers are, but we can do the same sorts of calculations with any of the vaccines currently available. They all have various risks, but in every case, the risks associate with not getting the vaccine outweigh the risks associated with getting it.\n\n*Obviously some people have pre-existing conditions that make vaccines dangerous for them. That is not what I am talking about here. I am addressing people who have no known health conditions that would prevent them from getting the vaccine.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument completely ignores the high prevalence of COVID and completely ignores the importance of non-lethal effects (including hospitalization, possibly long-term effects, time off work, etc.). Further, using this argument against the necessity for vaccines massively and inappropriately downplays the risk from COVID while exaggerating the risks from vaccines. The empirical reality is that COVID is very dangerous, with over 600,000 dead in the US alone, whereas the vaccines are very safe. Given that over 50% of the US population is currently vaccinated, if the vaccines were truly more dangerous than the risk from getting COVID, we\u2019d expect the rates of vaccine deaths and serious injuries to be surpassing the rates of deaths and serious injuries from COVID. In reality we are, of course, not seeing anything even remotely like that. Deaths and serious injury from COVID remain common in the unvaccinated, whereas serious injuries from the vaccines are extremely rare and deaths virtually unheard of.\n\nI think part of the problem is that we often view taking an action as the inherently riskier choice. After all, you can\u2019t get myocarditis from the vaccine if you never get the vaccine. That reasoning, while understandable, ignores the fact that not getting the vaccine is also an action, and that action puts you at a much greater risk of death or serious illness. Indeed, that risk from COVID is so great, and the risk from vaccines is so small, that even if you are young and healthy, the risk associated with not getting the vaccine is far higher than the risk associated with getting the vaccine. This is a mathematical fact.\n\nPlease read this post before making an argument about \u201cunknown long-term effects\u201d from vaccines.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nLiterature Cited",

        "Recently, the CDC released data on COVID comorbidities, including data showing that 6% of COVID-19 deaths only listed COVID on the death certificate, while the remaining 94% of COVID deaths also listed other conditions. Many have jumped on this as proof that COVID is far less deadly than previously claimed, and they are arguing that most reported COVID deaths are actually just people who died of some other condition while happening to have COVID. In particular, I keep seeing an analogy of someone who has COVID getting hit by a car, then the death being attributed to COVID. This is a very bad analogy (and faulty argument in general) that horribly mischaracterizes these data. So, I want to briefly explain what is actually going on.\n\nFirst, you need to realize that when a patient dies, doctors list all of the factors that contributed to the death. This often includes multiple conditions, at which point we call them \u201ccomorbidities.\u201d In the case of COVID, two main things are happening. First, in some cases, people have a pre-existing condition that interacts with COVID and makes them more likely to die from COVID. Second, COVID leads to conditions that then contribute to the death.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the pre-existing condition situation. We know that people with some health conditions are more prone to die from COVID than people without those conditions, because those conditions make them more vulnerable to COVID. Thus, there is an interaction between COVID and the pre-existing condition, with both contributing to the death. Importantly, however, in most cases, the person would not have died at this particular point in time had it not been for COVID. In other words, something like an existing respiratory problem makes people more sensitive to COVID, resulting in a higher death rate when infected with COVID. That does not mean that COVID wasn\u2019t a key factor in their deaths. It is simply that it was not the only factor.\n\nBy way of analogy, imagine that someone with asthma gets trapped in an environment with lots of smog, ultimately resulting in an inability to breathe and subsequent death. What killed them? Well, both the asthma and the smog played a role. The smog was a serious problem because of the asthma, but conversely, they could have kept on living with the asthma had it not been for the smog. If we could have prevented them form being exposed to the smog, they would have lived.\n\nEven so, for many people, COVID is fatal because of interactions with other conditions, but that still means that COVID was fatal. It still means that they would have lived had it not been for COVID.\n\nTo give one final analogy, imagine a disease that is far deadlier in men than in women. Imagine that we look at the mortality statistics form that disease and see that 94% of deaths were from men. It would clearly be absurd to say, \u201cthey didn\u2019t die form the disease, it was being a male that killed them.\u201d That would obviously be nuts. It would be apparent to everyone that there was an interaction between the disease and sex that causes men to be more sensitive to it. Even so, there are interactions between many pre-existing conditions and COVID that make people with those conditions more sensitive to COVID and more likely to die from it.\n\nOn the flip side, many of the reported comorbidities are actually caused by COVID. Look at the data from the CDC. The single most common comorbidity category* (68,004) was influenza/pneumonia. These diseases are often secondary infections that happen as a result of viral infections. Similarly, respiratory failure was present in 54,803 cases. Again, this is something that we know COVID causes. So many of these comorbidities are actually caused by COVID!\n\n*Technically, the most common category was \u201cother\u201d which includes a very wide range of conditions that were grouped together because each was too uncommon to merit its own category. Thus the influenza/pneumonia category was the most common category for discrete diseases, rather than the large hodgepodge of conditions.\n\nBy way of analogy, the argument being made by science deniers is no different from someone bleeding out from a gunshot wound, then someone else saying, \u201cbullets aren\u2019t dangerous, because she died from blood loss, not the bullet.\u201d That\u2019s obviously a dumb argument. She only lost the blood because of the bullet. Even so, many people are only dying from conditions like respiratory failure or heart failure because of COVID19.\n\nIt is also worth noting that, as is often the case, this argument is straight out of the anti-vaccine playbook. For diseases like measles, secondary infections with diseases like pneumonia often contribute to children\u2019s deaths. Thus, anti-vaccers incorrectly argue that measles isn\u2019t deadly because the pneumonia is what killed them. Just like COVID and my gunshot example, however, they only developed pneumonia because of measles.\n\nSo now, with all of that in place, let\u2019s circle back the analogy of someone getting hit by a car. I like analogies a lot. I have frequently argued that they are valuable for testing whether consistent reasoning is being applied. However, as I have explained before, for the analogies to be useful, they must follow the same logical structure as the original argument. That is very clearly not the case here. Someone who happens to have COVID getting hit by a car is a very, very different thing from either someone with a pre-existing condition that predisposes them to complications from COVID dying from an interaction between the condition and COVID or COVID itself causing a secondary condition.\n\nDo you see the difference? The vast majority of comorbidities listed are directly related to COVID either as a factor that exacerbates the situation or as a result of COVID. In contrast, the car accident has nothing to do with COVID. They are not analogous, and anyone who would use such a clearly terrible argument obviously does not know what they are talking about.\n\nHaving said all of that, there are almost certainly some cases in this database where COVID truly wasn\u2019t the cause. There are probably some cases where someone who had COVID just happened to have a heat attack that would have happened without the COVID, or where someone who had COVID was in an accident, but when you start looking closely at the data, those are clearly a very tiny minority, and the vast majority of comorbidities relate to COVID. Indeed, beyond these data and all the data looking at how COVID attacks the body, we also know that there have been far more deaths this year in the US than there were during the same time period last year (Weinberger et al. 2020). Indeed, there are more excess deaths than the total number of reported COVID deaths. Understanding exactly what that means is very complicated because there are many contributing factors. We may be underestimating COVID deaths, but also, there may be increased deaths due to factors like people not seeking medical help for conditions for which they normally would seek help. Conversely, things like a decrease in car accidents could pull the number the other direction. However, several pieces of evidence (such as a spike in excess deaths in places that had large outbreaks with many reported COVID deaths; e.g., New York city) indicate the COVID is a key factor in the number of excess deaths seen this year, and it is very unlikely that we are grossly overestimating the COVID mortalities.\n\nAs others have pointed out, the correct way to look at this 6% figure is not that only 6% of reported COVID deaths were actually from COVID. Rather, it means that of all the people who died from COVID, 6% did not have any other reported conditions. In other words, these data show that some people are more vulnerable to COVID than others due to existing health conditions (which we already knew) and COVID often results in secondary problems which contribute to patients\u2019 demise (again, which we already knew). Stop trying to twist science to fit your personal agenda and look rationally at the facts. Think critically and don\u2019t blindly believe something just because you saw it on Facebook or Twitter.",
        "The COVID era has been a golden age of misinformation. It has seen the development of innumerable false claims and shoddy arguments, and it has breathed new life into ancient anti-vaccine tropes. Indeed, I find it impossible to make any posts about this topic on social media without the comments immediately becoming a raging dumpster fire of falsehoods. The arguments are so innumerable that trying to debate them with someone quickly becomes an exercise in futility that feels like fighting the mighty hydra. As soon as one argument is debunked, several more pop up to take its place.\n\nThis article is my attempt to ameliorate that situation by compiling most of the common arguments I encounter into a single location where they can all be debunked in one fell swoop. Because there are so many of them, I will address each one only briefly and provide citations to the relevant studies as well as links to articles that go into more detail. To those fighting the good fight against misinformation, rock on, and I hope this article will make a useful addition to your arsenal. To those who arrived on this page because someone directed you here when you made one of these bad arguments, please actually look at the evidence. Please stop listening to your favorite politician, commentator, youtuber, fringe doctor, etc. and look at the actual evidence.\n\nMany of these arguments are interrelated and somewhat redundant, but they are often presented as separate arguments, so I wanted to deal with each explicitly here. They are ordered roughly into the following categories:\n\n1\u20138 = Arguments about COVID risk/mortality rates\n\n9\u201313 = Arguments based on the novelty of the vaccines\n\n14\u201320 = Arguments about vaccine effectiveness\n\n21\u201323 = Arguments about the reliability of science\n\n24\u201330 = Miscellaneous: conspiracy theories, VAERS, anecdotes, etc.\n\nWith that out of the way, let\u2019s do this.\n\nBad argument #1: COVID isn\u2019t dangerous\n\nReality: Yes it is; millions are dead\n\nOver 5.5 million people have already died, including over 850,000 in the USA alone. Something that has killed millions of people in only two years is, by definition, dangerous. Indeed, COVID was the 3rd highest cause of death in the USA in 2020 (Murphy et al. 2021) and 2021 (only cancer and heart disease were higher), and during outbreaks, it spiked to the #1 slot (see graph here). So unless you are going to tell me that accidents, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s, and every other cause of death that COVID beat aren\u2019t dangerous, please stop making the insane claim that COVID isn\u2019t dangerous. Finally, death is not the only possible negative outcome, and hospitalization, long-term effects, time off work, etc. should all be considered (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020).\n\nBad argument #2: 99.9% survive\n\nReality: That still means millions of deaths\n\nThe survival rate varies greatly among ages, populations, strains, etc. So a blanket number like this isn\u2019t accurate or useful. That is still a high death rate, and it has resulted in millions of deaths (see #1). Diseases can be very dangerous to a population either by having a high mortality rate or by having a high infection rate (or both), and COVID has a very high infection rate. If you have two diseases, one of which has a 10% mortality rate but only infects 100,000 people, and the other of which only has a 0.1% mortality rate but infects 10,000,000 people, you end up with 10,000 deaths either way.\n\nMore details here\n\nBad argument #3: People only die because of comorbidities, so the actual COVID death rate is very low/COVID death rates are inflated by comorbidities.\n\nReality: Comorbidities don\u2019t change the fact that these people died as a result of COVID\n\nComorbidities are simply additional factors that contributed to a death, and their existence does not negate the critical role of COVID in those deaths. If someone with a blood clotting disorder is stabbed and bleeds to death, the clotting disorder will be listed as a comorbidity because it was a contributing factor, but it would be insane to argue that this death is \u201cinflating stabbing mortality rates\u201d or that \u201cstabbing wasn\u2019t really the cause of death, because they had a clotting disorder.\u201d The fact remains that they would not have died at that point in time if it had not been for the stabbing, and something that would have prevented the stabbing would also have prevented their death. The same is true with COVID comorbidities. In most cases, these people would not have died at this particular point in time if it wasn\u2019t for COVID. Further, a huge portion of people have conditions that predispose them to severe COVID and would count as comorbidities if they die (CDC: People with Certain Medical Conditions).\n\nMore details here.\n\nBad argument #4: It\u2019s no worse than the flu\n\nReality: Yes it is\n\nIn the United States of America, influenza kills between 12,000 and 52,000 people annually, with a total of 342,000 flu deaths from the 2010\u20132020 seasons (CDC flu data). In sharp contrast, COVID has already killed >850,000 Americans, and in 2020 alone, the USA suffered 377,883 COVID deaths (Ahmad et al. 2021), with an even higher number of deaths in 2021. In other words, COVID kills more people in a single year than the flu kills in a decade. So please stop with this nonsense that it is no worse than the flu.\n\nBad argument #5: I\u2019m young and healthy, so I don\u2019t need a vaccine\n\nReality: You can still become seriously ill and/or spread it to others\n\nBeing young and healthy lowers your risk, but it does not eliminate it. There are thousands of previously young healthy people who have died of COVID, and thousands more who became seriously ill (see CDC data). Further, young healthy people can still spread it to those who aren\u2019t young and healthy (see #).\n\nAlso see #25\n\nBad argument #6: I trust my immune system, so I don\u2019t need vaccines\n\nReality: Your immune system is only as good as its training\n\nEven a healthy immune system has to learn how to fight a novel disease before it can do so effectively. Vaccines simply train your immune system so that it knows how to fight a disease like COVID when it encounters the real thing. This argument is about like saying, \u201cI trust the military, so I don\u2019t think they need intelligence reports on the enemy.\u201d\n\nDetails here\n\nBad argument #7: Humans have survived for thousands of years without vaccines\n\nReality: The species has lived, but millions of individuals have died.\n\nHomo sapiens as a species has survived, but countless individuals died, and since their invention, vaccines have saved untold millions of lives. No one is saying that COVID is going to wipe us our as a species. Rather, we are saying that millions of individuals could be saved with the vaccines.\n\nMore details here\n\nBad argument #8: Maybe previous strains were dangerous, but Omicron isn\u2019t\n\nReality: Omicron is less dangerous, but still dangerous\n\nEarly evidence does suggest that Omicron is less deadly than other strains, but that does not mean it isn\u2019t dangerous. Further, the current data also suggest that it is more easily transmitted, which means that your total risk may still be high, because risk is determined by the combination of the probability of catching the disease and probability of serious injury or death if you catch the disease (see #2). Further, even a less-deadly strain can still have substantial impacts by flooding hospitals with thousands of infected patients, which is exactly what is happening. Indeed, the USA just set a new record for hospitalized COVID patients, and remember that deaths always lag behind infections and hospitalizations.\n\nBad argument #9: The vaccines alter your DNA\n\nReality: mRNA cannot alter your DNA, and this is not genetic engineering.\n\nDNA is the master copy of your genetic material and is stored in your cells\u2019 nuclei. Think of DNA like the original architectural plans for a building. To make proteins, that double-stranded DNA gets transcribed in single-stranded RNA, and the RNA is then transported to ribosomes which use it as the plans for making proteins. Think of RNA like the blueprints used at a worksite that have been copied from the master plans. Thus, mRNA does not alter your DNA, because that\u2019s simply not what RNA does. Further, you get exposed to substantially more COVID mRNA during an actual COVID infection, and your body is already teaming with RNA from the millions of micro-organisms that live in and on you.\n\nMore details here\n\nBad argument #10: The vaccines are too new/rushed\n\nReality: No, they aren\u2019t/weren\u2019t\n\nMore details here and here\n\nBad argument #11: We don\u2019t know the long-term effects\n\nReality: Yes, we do\n\nNo vaccine has ever caused a serious, unpredicted adverse event that only showed years down the road. That is simply not how vaccines work. Because vaccines train the immune system before being quickly eliminated, their effects happen quickly (within minutes or days, not years later). We now have way more than enough data to be highly confident in the safety of these vaccines (see #10). This concern is completely unjustified and has no scientific basis. Further, if we are going to play the game of fearing the unknown, it is far more likely that COVID itself will have long-term adverse effects than it is that the vaccines will.\n\nMore details here and here\n\nBad argument #12: My children and I aren\u2019t lab rats and won\u2019t take an experimental vaccine\n\nReality: The vaccines have already passed experimental testing\n\nAgain, these vaccines have been thoroughly studied using massive sample sizes (see # 10). They are no longer experimental. They have passed the experimental stage. So this argument is nonsense. It blindly ignores all of those studies.\n\nBad argument #13: Children and pregnant women shouldn\u2019t be vaccinated\n\nReality: They are safer with vaccines\n\nHospitalization and death from COVID are less common in children, but they still happen, which is both tragic and preventable. The vaccines have been tested in children, and are safe and effective, resulting in 10x lower risk of hospitalization (Delahoy et al. 2021, Olson et al. 2022, Principi and Esposito 2022, Stein et al. 2022).\n\nIn contrast to children, pregnant women are actually at an increased risk of serious adverse events from COVID, but like children, the vaccines have been well-studied, and a large study (>40,000 participants) found that COVID19 vaccination is safe during pregnancy (Lipkind et al. 2022).\n\nBad argument #14: The vaccines aren\u2019t 100% effective\n\nReality: Nothing is 100% effective, but they are still very useful\n\nThis one is an anti-vaccer classic that has been around for ages. The reality is that almost nothing is 100% effective. Helmets, parachutes, seat belts, air bags, birth control, etc. are all less than 100% effective, yet clearly the are very useful. Risk is inherently about probabilities, not absolutes. So, when we talk about how well vaccines work, we are always talking about risk reduction, not risk elimination, and the vaccines do greatly reduce risk (see #10, 15, 16).\n\nMore details here and here.\n\nBad argument #15: The vaccines don\u2019t prevent you from getting COVID (breakthrough cases)\n\nReality: They reduce risk and severity\n\nAgain, almost nothing is 100% effective (see #14), but the vaccines reduce your risk. This has been borne out by study (Polack et al. 2020) after study (Mahase 2020) after study (Fowlkes et al. 2021) after study (Mart\u00ednez-Baz et al. 2021). Further, even if you become infected, the vaccines dramatically reduce your risk of getting a serious infection, and the rates of hospitalizations and deaths are substantially lower among the vaccinated than among the unvaccinated (Mart\u00ednez-Baz et al. 2021, Self et al. 2021, Tenforde et al. 2021). Indeed, the CDC data (COVID tracker) for October (the most recent complete month at the time I\u2019m writing this; see update below) showed that, compared to vaccinated individuals, unvaccinated individuals were 5 times more likely to test positive for COVID and 14 times more likely to die from COVID (also see Yek et al. 2022)!\n\nThis argument is like saying, \u201ccar safety features like ABS brakes, seat belts, and air bags don\u2019t prevent you from getting into a car accident.\u201d Sure, they don\u2019t completely prevent it, but some of them (e.g., brakes), make it less likely, and even if you are in an accident, they greatly reduce the risk that you will be seriously injured by the accident.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever had to do a risk assessment for a job, you know that risk involves both the likelihood of an event and severity if the event occurs.\n\nUpdate 30-1-2022: The updated CDC data (going through December 25 2021) show that the unvaccinated are 13X more likely to test positive for COVID and 68X more likely to die from COVID, compared to people with three doses of the vaccine.\n\nBad argument #16: The vaccines don\u2019t prevent you from spreading (transmitting) COVID\n\nReality: They reduce risk of transmission\n\nVaccinated individuals can spread the virus, but you have to be infected with COVID before you can spread COVID, and the vaccines greatly reduce your risk of becoming infected (see #15). Further, multiple studies (some of them quite large) have compared the COVID infection rates among family members of people who did or did not receive the vaccine, and exactly as you\u2019d expect from herd immunity, infection rates were lower for the people with a vaccinated family member (Anoop et al. 2021, Geir et al. 2021a, Geir et al. 2021b, Singanayagam et al. 2021). So yes, breakthrough cases do happen (see #15) because nothing is 100% effective (see#14), but again, the risk is greatly reduced by the vaccines, and the data are unequivocal: vaccinating protects those around you.\n\nBad argument #17: Most people who catch COVID are vaccinated\n\nReality: You have to look at ratios, not raw numbers\n\nThis claim is often untrue, but even when it is true, that is only because most people are vaccinated. We have to look at the rates not the raw numbers. By way of analogy, most car accidents involve sober drivers, but that doesn\u2019t mean it is safer to drive drunk; it\u2019s simply that most people drive sober, and we can see this when we look at the rates. Even so, when it comes to vaccines, the rates (infections per person) clearly show that the vaccines work and reduce risk (Polack et al. 2020, Mahase 2020, Fowlkes et al. 2021, Mart\u00ednez-Baz et al. 2021, see #10 and 15).\n\nMore details here and here\n\nBad argument #18: The vaccines are less effective against Omicron\n\nReality: They still help, and boosters largely restore effectiveness\n\nOmicron is still too new for us to have a completely clear picture of this. Current evidence does suggest that the vaccines are less effective against omicron than they were against delta (particularly when it comes to completely preventing asymptomatic infection, but see #20 regarding boosters), but they current evidence also suggests that they still greatly reduce your risk of getting a serious infection that would require hospitalization. Indeed, a report that was just released by the UK Health Security Agency (2021) found that 3 doses of the vaccine were 88% effective at preventing hospitalization from omicron. Similarly, data from South Africa showed that even just two doses of the Pfizer vaccine resulted in 70% effectiveness at preventing hospitalization from omicron (Collie et al. 2021).\n\nSee #20 on boosters\n\nBad argument #19: If vaccines work, why do you care if I am vaccinated?\n\nReality: Because I care about others\n\nVaccines greatly reduce risk, but they aren\u2019t 100% effective (see #14\u201316). Many people can\u2019t be vaccinated due to medical issues, but when everyone else is vaccinated, they are protected by herd immunity. Outbreaks can overwhelm the medical system and prevent others from getting the treatments they need (multiple uninfected people have died because of this; Sabbatini, et al. 2021). When most people are vaccinated, the risk of new strains emerging is reduced because it is harder for the virus to replicate (which is where new mutations come from) and spread. Outbreaks hurt everyone by harming the economy, causing lockdowns and restrictions, interfering with travel, etc.\n\nBad argument #20: They said we\u2019d only need two doses, but now it\u2019s three\n\nReality: So what? Why is that a problem?\n\nBad argument #21: But science has been wrong before\n\nReality: This is a misunderstanding of how science works\n\nScience is inherently the process of discrediting previous ideas, but in the modern era, previous ideas generally turn out to be incomplete more than entirely wrong, particularly for topics like vaccines where the evidence for their safety and effectiveness of vaccinees is overwhelming (see #10, 13\u201316). Further, the fact that scientific conclusions have been wrong before absolutely does not mean that you can blindly assume that the current evidence is wrong. If it did, you could reject any scientific result you like on the basis that science has been wrong before. You have to present actual evidence that the current conclusions are wrong, and there is simply no evidence that we are wrong about these vaccines.\n\nDetails here and here.\n\nAlso, see posts here, here, and here regarding the nature of a scientific consensus.\n\nSee this post regarding the claim that most scientific studies are wrong.\n\nBad argument #22: They laughed at Galileo and Columbus\n\nReality: This is a misconception and doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re right\n\nGalileo was mostly criticized by the church (i.e., people who were ignoring evidence because of ideology) not his fellow scientists. Also, critically, he had actual evidence, not conjecture, conspiracy theories, or a blind denial of evidence. Columbus, on the other hand was painfully wrong about the size of the earth (everyone already knew it was round) and just got lucky that there was another continent that Europeans didn\u2019t know about. Finally, again, you must have actual evidence that current conclusions are wrong (see #21).\n\nDetails here and here and here.\n\nBad argument #23: There used to be a consensus that smoking was safe\n\nReality: No there wasn\u2019t\n\nThis is a complete myth. Scientists have known since WWII that smoking was dangerous (Proctor 2012). Tobacco companies never managed to buy off more than a handful of doctors and scientists. What they had was a good PR team, not a scientific consensus (also see #21 and 22).\n\nSee posts here, here, and here regarding the nature of a scientific consensus.\n\nSee this post regarding the claim that most scientific studies are wrong.\n\nBad argument #24: I just don\u2019t trust pharmaceutical companies/It\u2019s all about money\n\nReality: It\u2019s about trusting science, not \u201cbig pharma\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t trust \u201cbig pharma\u201d either, and I\u2019m all for tight regulations and oversight, removing lobbyist, making drugs affordable, etc. I do, however, trust the science, a very large portion of which has been conducted by independent scientists who are not funded by pharmaceutical companies. The thing about science is that it is self-correcting. If pharmaceutical companies faked their data, other scientists would find out and report it. Keep in mind also that there are multiple competing pharmaceutical companies who would love to discredit each other\n\nSee posts here and here for more on the \u201cfollow the money\u201d argument.\n\nBad argument #25: [insert personal anecdotes]\n\nReality: Anecdotes are pretty meaningless in science\n\nThe fact that event A happened before event B does not indicate (or even suggest) that event A caused event B (that\u2019s known as a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy). At best, anecdotes can suggest things to be studied, but to actually determine causation, safety, or efficacy we need large properly controlled studies, and those have shown that these vaccines are safe and effective (see #10, 13\u201316). Anecdotes simply are not reliable evidence of causation.\n\nAdditionally, one specific anecdote I\u2019d like to deal with is the argument that, \u201cI got COVID and was fine; therefore, it\u2019s not dangerous.\u201d This is known as a survivorship bias: i.e., those who died are inherently not here to share their stories. The fact that you were fine does not alter the fact that millions weren\u2019t. Similarly, if you are unvaccinated, before you go around boasting that you have an incredible immune system because you haven\u2019t caught COVID, consider the fact that every single person who has caught COVID could have bragged about not catching COVID until the moment they caught it. In other words, contemplate the possibility that you simply haven\u2019t caught it yet.\n\nMore details here and here and here.\n\nBad argument #26: There are tens of thousands of vaccine injuries and deaths on VAERS\n\nReality: Being reported in VAERS does not mean that the vaccine caused the problem\n\nVAERS is a self-reported database that often contains all manner of absurdities. It is meant as an early warning system, and you have to be very, very careful when using it. The fact that something was reported in VAERS absolutely does not mean that the vaccine caused it. VAERS itself is explicit about that (see screenshot below [bold was in the original]; also see #25).\n\nMore details here\n\nBad argument #27: But there are real risks from the vaccines\n\nReality: Yes, but they are rare, and the benefits outweigh the risks\n\nAdverse events exist for all real medications. For vaccines, however, serious side effects are very rare, and the benefits from the vaccines far outweigh the risks from the disease. Risk assessment is an exercise in probabilities, and for almost any medicine, there will be some small subset who end up worse off because of it, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that your risk (i.e., your probability of injury) is lower with the vaccines than without them. As a result, vaccines save millions of lives, with COVID vaccines already having saved hundreds of thousands of lives (Mesle et al. 2021).\n\nSee studies cited in #10, 13\u201316\n\nBad argument #28: Various conspiracy theories/FDA corruption\n\nReality: Science is about evidence, not conjecture and conspiracy theories\n\nConspiracy theories are endless, but they all suffer the same fundamental problems of not having any credible evidence and stating assumptions as if they are facts. No actual evidence has been presented to show that data were faked, FDA officials were bought off to push the vaccines, etc. Further, this argument ignores the facts that there are countries other than the USA and health/regulatory agencies from around the world are in widespread agreement about the safety and effectiveness of these vaccines. The research is being conducted by tens of thousands of researchers from hundreds of universities, companies, and agencies from around the world. Faking these data would require a truly insane conspiracy in which virtually all of the world\u2019s scientists, health agencies, governments, and major pharmaceutical companies agreed to work together to lie and endanger the public. If that level of agreement among rival nations and countries sounds absurd, that\u2019s because it is absurd.\n\nBad argument #29: It\u2019s my choice/freedom. We shouldn\u2019t have vaccine mandates\n\nReality: You don\u2019t have the right to endanger others or ignore public health\n\nThis is a political argument, not a scientific argument, but I will briefly make three points. First, a large portion of the people I see making this argument also use the other arguments in this post, suggesting that they are letting political views override facts. Second, personal freedoms always end as soon as they endanger someone else, and refusing to vaccinate does endanger others (see #16, 19). This is why you have the freedom to drive a car, but not the freedom to drive recklessly or while drunk. Third, at least in most countries, the mandates simply place restrictions on the unvaccinated (e.g., requiring vaccination for a workplace), which is not the same thing as \u201cforcing\u201d someone (e.g., the government doesn\u2019t \u201cforce\u201d you to be sober, it simply restricts your right to drive unless you are sober; even so, you aren\u2019t being \u201cforced\u201d to vaccinate, your ability to work certain jobs is simply being restricted to protect your coworkers).\n\nBad argument #:30 But I heard on Youtube, Facebook, Joe Rogan, Fox, OAN, some random guy with cool sunglasses sitting in a pickup truck, etc\u2026\n\nReality: Those are not good sources\n\nPlease just stop. Stop with the deluded belief that you know more than the experts. Stop listening to unqualified people. Stop cherry-picking your experts. Multiple massive studies have clearly showed that COVID is dangerous and the vaccines are safe, effective, and help protect you and those around you. Either you accept that evidence or you deny it.\n\nMore on fact checking\n\nRelated posts\n\nLiterature cited",
        "Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the argument that \u201c99% of COVID patients survive\u201d has been repeatedly used as an excuse to oppose public health measures including mask mandates, lockdowns, and, more recently, vaccines. It asserts that because COVID has a ~99% survivorship, is not really that big of a concern and vaccines, masks, lockdowns, etc. are not needed.\n\nThere are many issues with this argument, but before I talk specifically about COVID-19, I want to discuss a hypothetical disease. Imagine that the majority of people who become infected with this hypothetical disease are fine. Roughly 70% of people are asymptomatic. Really serious consequences that could alter the rest of the victim\u2019s life only occur in about 0.5% of cases, and over 99.5% of patients make a full recovery. Actual mortality is even lower. The exact number varies, but even on the high end, over 99.9% people survive.\n\nNow, when I present this hypothetical disease like that, it probably doesn\u2019t sound that bad. Simply giving you those numbers without any additional context makes the disease sound pretty benign, and you might be tempted to use this \u201c>99% live\u201d argument and argue that we don\u2019t really need a massive vaccine push and should just wait for natural herd immunity.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing though. I lied when I said this was a hypothetical disease. Those are the stats for polio (CDC Pinkbook), a notoriously horrible disease that was once a scourge on our planet causing thousands of cases of paralysis and even death. It is a disease that, thanks to vaccines, we very rightly sent into oblivion in nearly every part of the world. If, however, instead of using vaccines, we had listened to this \u201c99% live\u201d argument, we would still have polio in countries like the USA, and children would still be getting infected, paralyzed, and even killed by this disease. Ninety-nine percent survival is not as high as it sounds, nor is it the only factor that has to be considered, but it can sound very persuasive when it is presented without the other necessary pieces of information.\n\nPlease, keep this in mind as we now turn our attention to COVID. If you are tempted to dismiss the severity of COVID or the necessity of vaccines because COVID \u201conly\u201d kills 1% of patients, keep in mind that polio \u201conly\u201d paralyzed 0.5% of its victims and killed less than 0.1%.\n\nNote: The actual COVID case fatality rate is affected by many factors (e.g., age). As such, it is far more complicated than a simple \u201c99%,\u201d and you should not confuse that number with the notion that you personally have a 99% chance of survival. Nevertheless, 99% is the number I keep seeing people use, and it is a rough approximation of an average for many parts of the world, so for simplicity, I will continue using it here.\n\nInfection prevalence matters\n\nOne of the key problems with the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it completely ignores the importance of transmissibility and infection prevalence (i.e., how easily a disease can spread). You see, a disease can be a serious threat to a population (in terms of mortality) either by having a high case fatality rate (i.e., killing a large percentage of patients) or by being highly contagious (i.e., infecting a large number of people), and case fatality rates can be very misleading by themselves.\n\nConsider, for example, two hypothetical diseases (A and B). A has an extremely high case fatality rate of 100%, but it is not very contagious and has a very low prevalence in the population. Only about 1 in 1 million people will catch it. In contrast, disease B has a much lower case fatality rate (1%), but is extremely contagious, and about 1 in 10 people will catch it.\n\nThis means that in a population of 10 million people, disease A will kill 10 people, whereas disease B will kill 10 thousand people! So, which of those diseases should you be more concerned about? Obviously disease B is more concerning, right? You are at a higher risk of dying form disease B, even though 99% of patients survive. Why? Because it is so common.\n\nIf you admit this basic fact, that disease B would be more concerning than disease A, then you have just admitted that case fatality rate is not sufficient in and of itself to tell you how concerning a disease is. If we had relied only on case fatalities, we would have incorrectly concluded that disease A was the bigger risk. This clearly demonstrates that the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is not a good argument, because we have to look at other factors besides just survivorship (the opposite of case fatalities), and even a disease with a 99% survival rate can be very dangerous to both populations at large and you personally if it is highly contagious.\n\nTo put it simply, when considering risk, you need to consider both how likely you are to be infected, and how likely you are to die (or suffer serious consequences) if you are infected.\n\nIn the case of COVID19, a large part of why it is so dangerous is its high rate of transmission, with new variants like the Delta strain making the situation even worse. That is why it has been able to kill over 4 million people world-wide, with over 600,000 deaths in the US alone.\n\nThose are sobering numbers, which should really make you stop and think long and hard about the veracity of the \u201c99% survival\u201d argument. To me, it seems self-evident that a disease that has already killed over 600,000 people in the US alone is a serious problem that merits something like a massive vaccination campaign, and the argument that the disease is not dangerous/doesn\u2019t merit vaccines is clearly flawed.\n\nIndeed, in 2020, COVID was the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA, behind only cancer and heart disease (Ahmad and Anderson 2021), and in early 2021, it spiked to the #1 cause of death in the US (a situation that is no longer the case thanks in part to vaccines). That\u2019s what COVID looks like when it is not controlled by measures like vaccines, and it should be abundantly apparent from that situation that simply having a 99% survival rate does not mean that a disease isn\u2019t a serious threat. Indeed, if you are going to argue that we don\u2019t need to be that worried about COVID 19, then you had better make that same argument about literally every other cause of death, because when allowed to spread, COVID kills more than any of them (or if you want to arbitrarily restrict yourself to the 2020 data, you\u2019d better make that argument about every cause of death other than cancer and heart disease).\n\nTo put all of that another way, a 99% survival rate is only comforting if the spread of the disease is being controlled by something like vaccines. A 99% survival rate without vaccines still results in hundreds of thousands of people dying. That is a simple fact.\n\nNatural herd immunity is a misnomer\n\nProponents of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument often say that we will eventually achieve natural herd immunity, at which point people will be protected even without vaccines. Let me briefly explain why that is a terrible idea.\n\nThe term \u201cherd immunity\u201d really only makes sense within the context of vaccines. Vaccine-induced herd immunity = a population that is protected from a disease. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d = a survivorship bias in which the survivors of the outbreak are protected from future infection and many previous herd members died. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d is a bloodbath. It\u2019s a nonsense term.\n\nEstimates for what it would take to achieve herd immunity to COVID vary, but even at the (probably) unrealistically low end of 60% immune, getting there in the US without vaccines would involve the deaths of roughly 2 million Americans! At what is probably the more realistic threshold of 90% immune, without vaccines, we are looking at about ~3 million dead Americans.\n\nThat\u2019s not herd immunity; that\u2019s herd culling. Alternatively, we can achieve actual herd immunity with vaccines without killing 2\u20133 million people.\n\nDisease risk is more than just death\n\nOne of the many deceptive aspects of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it acts as if COVID infection is a strictly binary situation: either you die or you are totally fine. That is, however, a completely false dichotomy. Since when is death the only outcome we care about? Many people who catch COVID live, but still undergo tremendous suffering physically, mentally, and financially. When we are considering the risks and benefits of something like a vaccine for COVID, we should not just look at whether or not you are likely to die. Things like time off work and physical suffering matter.\n\nThere is a vast spectrum of responses from \u201ctotally fine\u201d to \u201calive, but extreme suffering (and in the US, often financial difficulty).\u201d Good estimates of hospitalization rates are a bit hard to come by, and are usually expressed in terms of rate per population size, not rate per infection, but by taking the cumulative overall hospitalization rate per 100,000 people from the CDC, the US population size, and the cumulative cases in the US, we find that roughly 5% of COVID cases result in hospitalizations. A scientific study using more sophisticated methods provides a similar estimate of 4.5% (Reese et al. 2020) [note: as with the case fatality rate, these are crude rates for the whole population and actual rates vary by age group]. Indeed, COVID is so rampant, that roughly 0.5% of the entire US population has been hospitalized for it. That\u2019s actually an incredible number. One out of every 200 people in America has been hospitalized for COVID (again if we average across the population), and that\u2019s just actual hospitalizations, many more have been at home sick, took time off work, etc.\n\nFurther, the complications from the disease can be serious. COVID can set off a cytokine storm that affects multiple of your body\u2019s major systems. It\u2019s too early to know exactly what that means long-term, but based on what we know about COVID and other viral diseases, there is good reason to be concerned that many people who survive will have long-term lung and heart issues (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). To be clear, we need to wait for more data before knowing for sure if there will be long-term complications, but the reasonably high probability that there will be is certainly something to think about when considering the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and it\u2019s something that is completely ignored by this unreasonably simplistic \u201c99% survive\u201d argument.\n\nVaccines: benefits outweigh the risks\n\nFinally, let\u2019s briefly turn our attention to the COVID vaccines. This would take many posts to cover in proper detail, so I\u2019ll try to be brief and just hit the key points.\n\nAll vaccines have side effects, but serious side effects are rare, and your risk of a getting COVID and having a serious complication from it is much higher than your risk of a serious complication from vaccines. Countries with large vaccination programs (e.g., Israel; Rossman et al. 2020) are seeing massive drops in COVID infection, hospitalization, and death rates thanks to vaccines, and there has not been a comparable increase in injuries, hospitalizations, and deaths from vaccines. In other words, the vaccines are reducing risk.\n\nIn the USA, an analysis of data in May (by which time roughly 40% of the country had received both doses of the vaccine and 50% had at least one dose) found that out of over 107,000 COVID hospitalizations, fewer than 1,200 were for vaccinated individuals, and out of 18,000 COVID deaths, only ~150 of them were for vaccinated individuals. In other words, over 99% of COVID deaths were from unvaccinated individuals, as were nearly 99% of COVID hospitalizations. That trend has continued, and now with over half the country fully vaccinated, officials like Dr. Fauci are likewise reporting that over 99% of COVID deaths and over 97% of COVID hospitalizations are from the unvaccinated. The vaccines clearly work.\n\nFurther, we have not seen hospitalization or mortality rates from vaccine side effects rising to meet those numbers. In other words, with roughly half the population vaccinated, if the vaccine was truly more dangerous than the disease, we should see vaccine deaths and serious injuries at a rate that exceeds the rate for COVID. So where are the >18,000 individuals in May who died from the vaccine? Where are the >100,000 hospitalizations from the vaccine? They don\u2019t exist, because serious side effects are extremely rare.\n\nThis clearly shows that your total risk is lower with the vaccine than without it. These numbers make that undeniable. Yes, the disease has a ~99% survival, and yes, the vaccine does have side effects, but the disease is exceptionally common, and series side effects of the vaccine are exceptionally rare, which, when taken together, results in your risk of serious injury or death being substantially lower when you have the vaccine.\n\nJust to really drive this home, let\u2019s look specifically at myocarditis following the mRNA vaccines. It is still not entirely clear if this is actually a side effect of the vaccines, but there is growing evidence that it is causal. Exact rates vary, but every calculation shows them to be low (Shay et al. 2021). A large data set from Israel reported a mere 148 cases within 30 days of vaccination out of over 5 million people who were vaccinated (Israel Ministry of Health). Even if all of those were caused by the vaccine, that would be a rate of 0.003%! Further, 95% of those cases were mild.\n\nIn the USA, with over 150 million people vaccinated, using data from VAERS (much of which has not been verified), the WHO calculated the following myocarditis rates per fully vaccinated individual: 0.041% for males aged 12\u201329, 0.004% for females aged 12\u201329, and 0.002% for males and females over 29. Further, again, most of those cases were mild and did not require serious medical intervention. I have not so far seen any confirmed deaths from this. In contrast, COVID has a case fatality rate of ~1%.\n\nNow, I hear you saying, \u201cbut I am a male under 30, which means I\u2019m at a low risk of death from COVID and higher risk of myocarditis, so for me the risk outweighs the benefit,\u201d however, that math still doesn\u2019t work. From the start of the outbreak in the US (based on the current CDC data), there have been 2,462 deaths from COVID in males under 30, and 1,594 deaths in females under 30. There is no evidence to suggest that the vaccines are causing comparable carnage.\n\nScientists actually ran the numbers on this and calculated that for males under 30, every 1 million second doses of an mRNA vaccine will result in 39\u201347 cases of myocarditis, but will prevent 11,000 COVID cases, 560 hospitalizations, 138 ICU admissions, and 6 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021). Also, remember again that most of these myocarditis cases are mild, whereas for COVID, even just the expected number of ICU admissions is 3 times the number of mostly mild myocarditis cases! Further, that is for a group with a relatively low COVID risk and relatively high myocarditis risk. The benefits of the vaccine are even more exaggerated for other groups. In men over 29, for example, 1 million second doses will only result in 3\u20134 cases of myocarditis, and will prevent 15,300 COVID cases, 4,598 hospitalizations, 1,242 ICU admissions, and 700 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021)!\n\nAlso, notice how those who like to cast aspersions on vaccines try to downplay death from COVID while hyping mostly mild injury from the vaccine. Indeed, this \u201c99% survive\u201d argument would have us believe that a 1% fatality is too low to be seriously concerned, but a 0.002\u20130.041% rate of generally mild myocarditis is unacceptably high. It is crazy to think that 3\u20134 mostly mild cases of myocarditis is worse than 700 deaths! That\u2019s simply not how math works.\n\nThe numbers are undeniable: your personal risk* is lower with the vaccine than without the vaccine, even though \u201c99% of people survive.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been focusing on the concerns around Pfizer and Moderna because those are the prominent vaccines where most of my readers are, but we can do the same sorts of calculations with any of the vaccines currently available. They all have various risks, but in every case, the risks associate with not getting the vaccine outweigh the risks associated with getting it.\n\n*Obviously some people have pre-existing conditions that make vaccines dangerous for them. That is not what I am talking about here. I am addressing people who have no known health conditions that would prevent them from getting the vaccine.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument completely ignores the high prevalence of COVID and completely ignores the importance of non-lethal effects (including hospitalization, possibly long-term effects, time off work, etc.). Further, using this argument against the necessity for vaccines massively and inappropriately downplays the risk from COVID while exaggerating the risks from vaccines. The empirical reality is that COVID is very dangerous, with over 600,000 dead in the US alone, whereas the vaccines are very safe. Given that over 50% of the US population is currently vaccinated, if the vaccines were truly more dangerous than the risk from getting COVID, we\u2019d expect the rates of vaccine deaths and serious injuries to be surpassing the rates of deaths and serious injuries from COVID. In reality we are, of course, not seeing anything even remotely like that. Deaths and serious injury from COVID remain common in the unvaccinated, whereas serious injuries from the vaccines are extremely rare and deaths virtually unheard of.\n\nI think part of the problem is that we often view taking an action as the inherently riskier choice. After all, you can\u2019t get myocarditis from the vaccine if you never get the vaccine. That reasoning, while understandable, ignores the fact that not getting the vaccine is also an action, and that action puts you at a much greater risk of death or serious illness. Indeed, that risk from COVID is so great, and the risk from vaccines is so small, that even if you are young and healthy, the risk associated with not getting the vaccine is far higher than the risk associated with getting the vaccine. This is a mathematical fact.\n\nPlease read this post before making an argument about \u201cunknown long-term effects\u201d from vaccines.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nLiterature Cited",

        "I\u2019ve been a fan of Jon Stewart for a long time. I usually find him to be both funny and insightful. It was, therefore, with great dismay that I watched him spread a conspiracy theory and inaccuracies about science on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and I regret that it is now my duty to explain his errors.\n\nIn the clip, which you can see here, Stewart begins by saying that we owe a great debt to science for helping to ameliorate the COVID19 crisis. That much I absolutely agree with. Scientists deserve an enormous amount of gratitude for developing the vaccines that are currently saving lives and reducing suffering around the world. Unfortunately, the interview quickly took a turn for a worse as Stewart endorsed the conspiracy theory that the virus that causes COVID19 escaped from the lab in Wuhan and made numerous dangerous, false statements about how scientists operate.\n\nMischaracterizations of science and scientists\n\nBefore I get to the conspiracy theory, I want to respond to a more general comment he made which really bothered me, because it is a common and damaging misconception about science and scientists. He said,\n\n\u201cThis is the problem with science. Science is incredible, but they don\u2019t know where to stop, and nobody in the room with those cats ever goes, \u2018ya know, I don\u2019t know if we should do that.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis is an inherently untrue statement that is, unfortunately, a very common misconception about science, perhaps most famously stated by Dr. Ian Malcom in Jurassic Park as, \u201cYour scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn\u2019t stop to think if they should.\u201d\n\nIn reality, most of us scientists spend a great deal of time thinking about the implications of our work and whether it is a good idea, and even if we didn\u2019t want to do that, we are forced to do that by ethics committees. The days of \u201cmad scientists\u201d operating in isolation doing dangerous, unethical experiments are long gone. In modern science, you have to submit proposals before you do research, and those proposals get reviewed by ethics boards (which, btw, usually include scientists and non-scientists) who will approve, reject, or insist on modifications to your proposal. If you get approved, you then have to submit reports on what you actually did, and there are usually audits. Further, if you want to work with something dangerous, you often need additional government clearance and approval. Things are checked and regulated, particularly in a major lab like the one in Wuhan.\n\nIndeed, Stewart went on to give an example that undercut his whole argument. In a deranged monologue in which he asserted (I hope jokingly) that scientists would be the death of humanity, he inaccurately described scientists\u2019 re-animation of the virus that caused the 1918 flu,\n\n\u201cThey had a little sample of [the virus], and it hadn\u2019t been a scourge in the earth for 100 years, and they thought to themselves, \u2018what if we just, I don\u2019t know, woke it up?\u2019 And nobody in the room was like, \u2018No. Let\u2019s not do that.'\u201d\n\nThe reality of the situation was quite different. The research was conducted by the CDC and went through both an Institutional Biosafety Committee review and an Animal Care and Use Committee review before being conducted. The risks and benefits were carefully thought out, evaluated, and discussed by several groups of people, and very strict bio-safety guidelines were put in place and followed. This wasn\u2019t a scientist working in their garage doing whatever popped into their head. It was, carefully planned, well-thought out, closely monitored, rigorously controlled research in a secure, state-of-the-art laboratory (you can read the details on the CDC\u2019s website).\n\nTo be 100% clear, that obviously does not mean that no one ever goes rogue and operates outside of the system. There will always be people who break the rules, but those cases are rare, they are pretty close to impossible at a lab facility like Wuhan, and when those people get caught, the consequences are generally serious (such as loss of funding, loss of job, and sometimes prosecution). So, this notion that no one is telling scientists not to do things is simply false. There are constantly people checking our proposals and telling us not to do things.\n\nThis misconception matters, because it paints scientists as people who are totally disconnected from reality, blindly doing whatever interests us regardless of the dangers, but that\u2019s a caricature, not reality. Scientists are normal people. We think about things like ethics and broad implications, and we have people checking us. Further, this sort of caricature downplays the importance of labs like the Wuhan lab. It\u2019s not full of \u201cmad scientists.\u201d It\u2019s full of incredibly intelligent, thoughtful people doing important work that needs to be done if we are going to prevent future disease outbreaks and mitigate the ones that we fail to prevent. Indeed, that Spanish Flu research that Stewart mocked gave us important insights into how highly virulent pathogens operate, and those insights help us to prepare for future outbreaks. This sort of mischaracterization of scientists undermines the critical work that scientists do.\n\nThe lab leak conspiracy theory\n\nMoving on, I\u2019m not going to go into great detail debunking the Wuhan lab leak conspiracy theory, because it has been thoroughly covered elsewhere (e.g., Siegel 2021). Instead, I\u2019ll just hit a few highlights and point out some errors in Stewart\u2019s reasoning. Before I start, I do realize that much of what he said was deliberate hyperbole for comedic effect, so I have no intention of nitpicking his jokes and will instead focus on the broad strokes.\n\nThe crux of his argument was basically just proximity:\n\nThere is a lab in Wuhan that studies novel coronaviruses The novel coronavirus originated in Wuhan Therefore, it escaped from the lab\n\nTo anyone familiar with logic, this reasoning is clearly fallacious. It\u2019s a non sequitur fallacy. Just because the two things occurred in proximity doesn\u2019t mean that there was any relationship between them (note: you might argue that this is a correlation fallacy, but that generally involves trends, not isolated incidents; it is arguably a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy [i.e., there was a lab in Wuhan, then there was an outbreak; therefore the lab caused the outbreak]).\n\nIt is entirely possible for the co-occurrence of two things to be a coincidence, or for there to be some other factor that caused those two things to line up. In this case, the latter is true. Infectious disease labs very often focus on the pathogens around them, and as Colbert tried to point out to Stewart, China has many coronaviruses, and Wuhan is a massive city with an active wildlife trade. In other words, if a novel coronavirus was going to jump to humans, we would expect it to be in a city like Wuhan, which is why there was a coronavirus lab in Wuhan. As one virologist (Vincent Munster) commented,\n\n\u201cNine out of ten times, when there\u2019s a new outbreak, you\u2019ll find a lab that will be working on these kinds of viruses nearby\u201d (Maxem and Mallapaty 2021).\n\nSo, no, the fact that the outbreak originated in a city that has a coronavirus lab does not suggest that the outbreak was a result of a lab leak. That is extremely circumstantial evidence and totally ignores the fact that labs are often positioned in the areas where we\u2019d expect an outbreak.\n\nSimilarly, Stewart dismissed the abundance of bats around Wuhan by pointing out that there are also lots of bats in Texas, but the outbreak didn\u2019t start there. This is more specious logic (indeed, it\u2019s a reductio ad absurdum fallacy). It\u2019s not simply that there are bats in China, but rather that China is a hot spot of human-wildlife interactions. It is those interactions that are problematic and, it is something scientists have been warning about for years. Back in 2007, a paper in Clinical Microbiology Reviews said,\n\n\u201cThe presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is a time bomb\u201d (Cheng et al. 2007).\n\nThis isn\u2019t a virus that came out of nowhere with no warnings. It\u2019s something scientists have worried about for a long time, which, once again, is why labs that study these diseases are so important, and why it is so dangerous to undercut them by spreading this kind of conspiracy theory. It\u2019s also, again, why this lab was in China.\n\nAs you can hopefully see, Stewart\u2019s arguments are bogus, but what should we make of the lab leak hypothesis more generally? As I said, I\u2019m not going to go into a ton of detail, because that is a whole series of posts in itself, but here are a few highlights.\n\nFirst, the WHO investigation into the Wuhan laboratory concluded that it was \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d that the virus had escaped from the lab. Second, scientific assessments of the sequences in SARS-CoV-2 have shown that it is most likely natural. Andersen et al. (2020) found no evidence to suggest that it was man-made and,\n\n\u201cstrong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not the product of purposeful manipulation.\u201d\n\nIf the virus was engineered, we\u2019d see evidence of that in the genome, but we don\u2019t see that evidence. This is critical, because it means that even if it escaped from a lab, it was probably a natural virus that was being stored there, not one that was engineered. As you will see, however, the arguments for the lab leak hypothesis generally center around the virus not being natural (you can read more about this research and how we know the virus wasn\u2019t man-made in these articles: Bryner 2020; Hayes 2020; Saey 2020).\n\nSo, where does this leave the lab-leak hypothesis? It leaves it solidly in the territory of conspiracy theories that ignore official reports, cherry pick experts, and spin fanciful tales that attempt to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d based on circumstantial evidence. This hypothesis inherently requires that scientists and governments have lied and falsified records, but there is no actual evidence of that happening. It is just something that has to be blindly assumed in order for this conspiracy theory to be possible, and as a scientist, I have an aversion to making more assumptions than necessary.\n\nThe more scientific arguments for the lab leak hypothesis have tended to focus either on the fact that we have yet to find the original virus in the wild yet or on an unusual CGG-CGG sequence. The fact that we have not confirmed the original host is, however, hardly surprising. It often takes many years to track novel virus back to the original host. It took 14 years to find the origin of the SARS epidemic (Maxem and Mallapaty 2021). So, 1.5 years of failed searching is hardly enough to conclude that it probably isn\u2019t natural. The other argument is that the furin cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 has a CGG-CGG sequence that is unusual. CGG codes for the amino acid arginine, but there are several other ways to produce arginine, and CGG is relatively uncommon in coronavirus. This led David Baltimore to famously refer to the double CGG as a \u201csmoking gun\u201d that the virus was man made. That statement was, however, misleading, because about 3% of the arginine sequences in SARS-CoV-2 are CGG, and CGG is found in plenty of other coronaviruses. It is, therefore, entirely possible for CGG-CGG to arise naturally, and even Baltimore has now acknowledged that it could be natural (Maxem and Mallapaty 2021). Dr. Anderson, who wrote the study I mentioned earlier, explained the situation in more detail, here.\n\nFinally, what are we to make of various governments and even Dr. Fauci saying there should be thorough investigations? First, as I explained in a previous post this week, we should never conflate government decisions with scientific evidence. Second, if people like Fauci want more investigations, I don\u2019t really object (I don\u2019t think they are necessary, but I\u2019m not going to rant in opposition of them either). However, critically, as it stands right now, the weight of evidence is strongly against the lab leak hypothesis, and arguments to the contrary inevitably stray into the realm of conspiracy theories, conjecture, and baseless assumptions. As such, it is extremely problematic for a man like Stewart to insist on national television that the virus originated in a lab. Look, if you want to say, \u201cthe current evidence suggests that it did not escape the lab, but out of an abundance of caution and in the interest of being as certain as possible, we should conduct another investigation\u201d I don\u2019t necessarily have a problem with that, but that is a very, very different thing from the type of proclamation that Stewart made or the types of conspiracy theories that I\u2019m seeing online. Further, it absolutely does not justify Stewart\u2019s rant about what he perceives as the dangers of science.\n\nLet me conclude this with a question. If you doubt the official reports and want another investigation, will you accept the results of that investigation if it shows the disease was natural? To put that another way, how many investigations are required to convince you? This is a question that is worth thinking about. It is always a good idea to ask yourself what it would take to convince you that you were wrong.\n\nUpdate 1-Sept-2021: A new review paper (Holmes et al. 2021) which was released after this post has reviewed the evidence for the lab leak hypothesis in even more detail, and concluded that the evidence strongly points away from that hypothesis.\n\nSources",
        "Concern over unknown, future side effects is by far the most common reason I hear people give for why they aren\u2019t vaccinating against COVID. At a quick glance, that may seem reasonable, but when you start really looking into the science, it quickly becomes clear that there is simply no reason to suspect that there will be dangerous long-term consequences of these vaccines. Indeed, based on everything we know about the immune system, vaccines in general, and these vaccines specifically, it is extremely unlikely that they will cause unknown, serious, wide-spread side effects in the future, and the known risks from COVID far outweigh the hypothetical risks from the vaccines.\n\nIn this post, I\u2019m going to carefully go over the science and logic that allows us to be so confident in the long-term safety of these vaccines, but before I do that, I want to briefly explain who my target audience is here, namely, the \u201cvaccine hesitant.\u201d I am refereeing to the people who usually would not consider themselves \u201canti-vaccers\u201d and would usually vaccinate themselves and their children but have been swept up in the maelstrom of misinformation and fear about the new COVID vaccines. If you are someone who is truly seeking information and trying to think for yourself, then please hear me out and seriously consider the arguments and evidence that I am going to present. Do not give in to the baseless fearmongering that is rampaging through the internet and media.\n\nTo that end, I want to point out right at the start that this tactic of stirring up fear of future, unknown, long-term consequences is not new or unique to COVID vaccines. It is straight out of the traditional anti-vaccine playbook. It is something I was writing about long before COVID, and the argument is just as flawed now as it was then. So, if you are someone who eschews the title \u201canti-vaccer,\u201d but are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of the arguments about unknown, long-term effects, please realize that these are not new arguments that arose out of legitimate concerns specifically about COVID vaccines. Rather, stoking fear of future unknowns is a standard (and flawed) anti-vaccer tactic that they have been using for decades and are now dressing up and presenting as if it is a novel concern for COVID vaccines. Do not be fooled by this tactic.\n\nThis post is necessarily long, because there\u2019s a lot to talk about in order to cover this topic properly, but, again, I have written this for people who are truly trying to think for themselves, and are truly seeking information. So if that is you, please read this carefully in its entirety.\n\nBecause of the length of this post, I will summarize key points in bullets below, before elaborating on each of them.\n\nSummary: TL;DR\n\nmRNA vaccines have been being studied for over a decade (including human trials). Current COVID vaccines have been extremely well studied, with sample sizes of hundreds of thousands of people, and studies have been compiled into large meta-analyses/systematic reviews. Thus, the short-term risks of the vaccines are extremely well-documented, and the benefits outweigh the risks. The only \u201cunknown\u201d is about long-term effects; however\u2026 No vaccine has ever caused the type of widespread, serious side effect years down the road that everyone is afraid of. Nearly all side effects occur shortly after vaccination (see #2). The only example of a sided effect that showed up months later appear within a year (whereas we\u2019ve been using COVID vaccines for over a year) and was rare. The vaccine benefits still outweighed the risks. Vaccines rarely cause long-term (future) side effects because they use low doses over a short time. Vaccines simply train your immune system. Vaccines are quickly removed from the body. Most vaccine components were well-studied, and their safety is known. mRNA: mRNA does not alter your DNA. mRNA is very quickly broken down and removed. mRNA in vaccines cannot make your body produce entire viruses. You are constantly exposed to mRNA from viruses (e.g., from colds) If you catch COVID, your cells will use viral mRNA to make proteins just like they do from the vaccine, but\u2026 Your cells will make entire viruses, not just a single protein. You will be exposed to far higher levels of mRNA. Side effects from immune stimulation will usually happen right away and will usually be worse from actual infection with COVID. A demand for long-term studies is meaningless unless you can justify why a particular length of time is needed. No matter how long something has been studied, it is always technically possible that an effect won\u2019t show up until slightly after the length of that study. This is true for all medications, foods, minerals, vitamins, etc., yet we don\u2019t fear most of them. Therefore, you must provide actual evidence or reasoning to think that a futre side-effect is actually likely. Focusing on a highly-unlikely, unknown, hypothetical risk from the vaccine while downplaying the very real and serious risk from COVID is bad risk assessment. Fears over unknown long-term effects of the vaccines are baseless. The burden of proof is on anyone claiming that the vaccines are dangerous.\n\nNot as new as you might think\n\nBefore we go into the details of the COVID vaccines, we need some background information to put them in context, and I think it is important to point out that these vaccine technologies are not as new as people are often led to believe. Sure, these exact vaccines were developed recently, but mRNA vaccines have been being developed and tested for years. Thus, the underlying technology is well-studied.\n\nLet me direct you to a review paper published in 2018 (before COVID) titled, \u201cmRNA vaccines \u2014 a new era in vaccinology\u201d (Pardi et al. 2018). This review covers over a decade of research on mRNA vaccines, including safety and efficiency trials on mice (Fleeton 2001; Geall et al. 2012; Magini et al. 2016), ferrets (Brazzoli et al. 2015), pigs (Schnee et al. 2016), monkeys (Brito et al. 2014), and yes, even humans (Craenenbroeck et al. 2015; Bahl 2017; Alberer et al. 2017). As you\u2019d expect in a rapidly growing field, even more studies were published following that review, (but prior to COVID). Feldman et al. (2019), for example tested mRNA influenza vaccines in over 200 people, including following them for a full year after the vaccines to assess safety and effectiveness. Similarly, studies like Alberer et al. (2017) followed patients for a year prior to publishing and continued to follow them after publication.\n\nTo be clear, those human trials were small trials; my point is simply that we were able to develop these COVID vaccines so quickly not by rushing, but rather by utilizing a robust body of research that had already been conducted. All of the information was there, waiting to be applied to something like COVID.\n\nThe way that people (including politicians and the media) are talking about these vaccines, you\u2019d think that they represent totally uncharted territory. Reading the comments on my page, people are acting like we have almost no knowledge about them and are shooting in the dark, recklessly plowing into the unknown, but that\u2019s simply not true. In reality, we knew a ton about mRNA vaccines before COVID, and that should really change your perspective on these vaccines.\n\nIt is so easy to give into fear of the unknown, particularly when you are so constantly bombarded with people\u2019s concerns. I don\u2019t blame anyone for that;\u2019 it\u2019s human nature, but it\u2019s important that we use logic and facts to overcome our base fears, and if you step back and start to rationally look at the wealth of knowledge these vaccines were based on (including human trials spanning a year or more), that really should paint these vaccines in a different light and help to alleviate those fears.\n\nNote that I only cited a small handful of the studies that had been conducted prior to COVID.\n\nWhat we know: proximate (short-term) side effects\n\nThe crux of the concern over these vaccines is fear of the unknown, so before we can talk about the unknown, we need to be clear on what we do know, as well as clearly defining what we mean by \u201cunknown, long-term effects.\u201d\n\nThere are basically two categories of effects we need to talk about:\n\nProximate effects (short-term) = effects that first occur shortly after vaccination\n\nUnknown future effects (long-term) = effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination (Note 1)\n\nIt is important to make this distinction, because I often find that people meander back and forth between these two without having a clear understanding of what is actually known or how it is known. So let me try to be as clear as possible: we have an extremely robust understanding of proximate effects, and the fact that the vaccines are new is 100% irrelevant.\n\nProximate effects are fairly straightforward to test. First, scientists conduct phase 1\u20133 human trials using a randomized, placebo-controlled approach, where they follow thousands of patients for several weeks following vaccination. Then, once the vaccine is released to the general public, scientists continue to monitor it for side effects using things like large cohort studies and case-controlled studies. As the sample sizes increase, so does our ability to detect increasingly rare events. With tens of thousands of participants, we can detect events that occur every few thousand people, but we will miss events that happen once for every 10,000 people. At a few hundred thousand people, we can detect events that occur once per tens of thousands of people, but will miss events that happen once for every 100,000 people, etc. (Note: numbers are approximations).\n\nThere are two critical points here. First, because our ability to detect rare side effects is dependent on sample size, as the sample size increases, any new side effects will, by definition, be increasingly rare. By the time we are into the millions (as we are with COVID vaccines) we aren\u2019t going to suddenly find a new common serious side effect, because those would have been picked up at much smaller sample sizes.\n\nSecond, the novelty of the vaccines is completely and totally irrelevant. Because we are talking about events that happen within a few weeks of being vaccinated, it does not matter if the vaccines have been available for two months or two hundred years. The only thing that matters is the sample size (i.e., number of participants). Let me say that again (in bold), our ability to confidently know the rates of proximate side effects depends entirely on the sample size; the age of the vaccine is 100% irrelevant.\n\nIn the case of COVID, we were able to get these sample sizes extremely quickly because there were so many cases of COVID and governments dumped so much money into massive vaccine campaigns. All of the currently recommended vaccines passed their initial phase 3 trials with large sample sizes. For example, Pfizer used over 43,000 participants (Polack et al. 2020), and Moderna used over 30,000 (Mahase 2020).\n\nFollowing those phase 3 trials, numerous large studies have been released. Indeed, so many studies have been conducted that we can do systematic reviews and meta-analyses. As explained here, these combine the data from multiple studies to look for overarching effects and are the highest level of scientific evidence. Qianhui et al. (2021), for example, included 87 different safety studies, and concluded that, \u201cAvailable evidence indicates that eligible COVID-19 vaccines have an acceptable short-term safety profile.\u201d\n\nYet more studies have been conducted since that review/meta-analysis, and some of them are truly massive. Barda et al. (2021), for example, compared over 800,000 vaccinated individuals to over 800,000 unvaccinated individuals to look at the rates of adverse events from the Pfizer vaccine as well as the rates of those same events in people who develop COVID. Not only did the vaccine have low rates of serious side effects, but, for most conditions (including myocarditis and myocardial infarction), the rates of those events were higher in people who caught COVID than in people who received vaccines (Note 2).\n\nOther calculations of the rates of specific adverse events have had even large sample sizes. For example, the Israel Ministry of Health used over 5 million people to calculate the rate of myocarditis following vaccination. Similarly, in the USA, the CDC has several hundred million vaccine doses to use in its calculations.\n\nThe point is that we are extremely confident about the short-term consequences of the vaccines. It\u2019s hard to overstate the massive volume of data we have. Barda et al. (2021), for example, is one of largest cohort studies I have ever read. It is larger than most studies on the safety of well-established vaccines that have been available for decades. Indeed, we have been able to quickly collect so much data that our knowledge of the short-term safety of COVID vaccines is equal to or greater than our knowledge of the short-term safety of many standard vaccines.\n\nAgain, to be 100% clear, the fact that the vaccines are relatively new simply does not matter for these short-term effects. Further, these studies aren\u2019t the result of \u201crushing.\u201d Rather, it is simply matter of vaccinating so many people so quickly that we were able to rapidly collect the data that would usually take years to accumulate. It is the size and volume of the studies that matters, and we have numerous truly massive studies unequivocally showing that serious side effects are rare and the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nTo put it simply, the short-term side effects of the COVID vaccines have been thoroughly studied and are extremely well-documented. Scientifically, these vaccines are no longer experimental (with the exception of their application to young children, in some cases). They have already passed numerous experiments and the evidence is clear (Pfizer isn\u2019t \u201cexperimental\u201d legally either). Insisting that we haven\u2019t studied the vaccines well-enough to know the short-term side effects is, at this stage, science denial.\n\nSee Note 3 regarding the supposed vaccine-related deaths and injuries reported in VAERS.\n\nVaccines don\u2019t cause wide-spread, long-term adverse events\n\nNow we can finally turn our attention specifically to the topic of unknown, long-term effects (which, remember, are effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination; Note 1). I realize I took a long time getting here, but that background was important, because I have shown that we have a massive body of studies showing that the COVID vaccines have few serious side effects shortly after receiving them. Thus, the only way to doubt their safety without outright science denial is to raise concerns over presently unknown, long-term effects, but, as I will show, those concerns have no scientific merit.\n\nThe type of future long-term consequence that everyone seems so afraid of (i.e., the type that only manifests months or years down the road) is virtually unheard of from vaccines. I looked long and hard for examples of this occurring, and in the entire history of vaccines, I was only able to find one: Pandemrix, an H1N1 vaccine used in Europe for the 2009\u20132010 flu season was associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy that usually only manifested weeks or months after the vaccine. You can read more details on Thoughtscapism and Skeptical Raptor, but there are just three points I want to make.\n\nDepending on the study, the lag between vaccination and onset of narcolepsy was 0-242 days (median = 42; Partinen et al. 2012) or 0-360 days (median not reported; Nohynek et al. 2012). Pfizer and Moderna both began their phase 3 COVID vaccine trials on 27 July 2020 (~400 days ago) and received emergency use authorization (thus starting mass vaccination campaigns in the USA) in December 2020 (~260 days ago). Indeed, Israel had already administered over 1 million doses by the end of 2020. This means we are already past the time frame where we should have started picking up something comparable to the long-term effects of Pandemrix. As is so often the case with vaccine side effects, the disease they prevent (influenza in this case) also causes the same side effect. This side effects was rare (between 1 in 52,000 doses and 1 in 57,500 doses in England [Miller et al. 2013] and 1 in 16,000 in Finland [Nohynek et al. 2012; for unclear reasons, Finland had a high rate that could not be generalized to other countries), and the benefits of the vaccine still outweighed the risk.\n\nThat last point is really important, because for it to turn out that avoiding the COVID vaccines was the safer choice, unknown future side effects would not only have to exist, but they would have to be so common and so serious that they outweigh the enormous known benefits of the vaccines, and that is a situation that has never occurred for any vaccine (Note 4). For reasons that I\u2019ll explain in the next sections, that\u2019s simply not how vaccines interact with the body.\n\nSo, if you are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of a fear of unknown, serious, long-term side effects, ask yourself, is that fear really rational given that future, long-term side effects of vaccines are virtually unheard of, and there has never been a case where those side effects were widespread and outweighed the benefits of the vaccines?\n\nWhy vaccines don\u2019t cause future long-term effects: Low dose, short exposure\n\nLet\u2019s now talk about why vaccine side effects nearly always show up shortly after vaccination. The type of long-term consequence we are talking about typically comes from one of two causes: a very large dose over a short time, or a small dose over a prolonged period of time. Vaccines don\u2019t fit either of those categories. They are fundamentally different from most medications because they simply train your immune system before being quickly removed. Your own immune system is what provides a lasting benefit. Further, vaccines do this via low, non-toxic doses. Remember, the dose makes the poison. Everything, even water (Garigan and Ristedt 1999), is toxic at a high enough dose and safe at a low enough dose. So people who scream about \u201cTOXIC CHEMICALS\u201d in vaccines are ignoring basic chemistry. There is no such thing as a toxic chemical, there are only toxic doses, and the doses in vaccines are not toxic.\n\nOne of the most common arguments I hear people making to justify concerns over COVID vaccines is, \u201clook at all the examples of drugs that were approved, then years later long-term effects were found.\u201d Those examples are, however, nearly always for drugs that were taken repeatedly. It\u2019s the cumulative effect that causes the risk (particularly for chemicals that persist in your body for long periods of time). Vaccines, in contrast, have limited exposure, and your body quickly eliminates them. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, the vaccine itself has been totally eliminated from your body. The long-term protection comes from immune system memory, not from the vaccines themselves.\n\nThis is really important, because it means we don\u2019t have a mechanism through which COVID vaccines would cause long-term harm. Because vaccines are a low doses given 2-3 times, we expect any consequences to happen quickly, which is exactly what we find. The most common side effects are things like soreness and moderate flu symptoms that start within a few hours or days of receiving the vaccine. These effects aren\u2019t because the vaccine is \u201ctoxic\u201d but rather because it is doing exactly what it was designed to do and stimulating your immune system. It\u2019s that activation of your immune system that makes you feel unwell, but that activation is critical, because it is how your immune system learns to identify and fight COVID. Similarly, serious side effects from the vaccines, while rare, usually show up shortly after vaccination.\n\nSide effects that don\u2019t show up for months or years simply aren\u2019t expected from vaccines because of how vaccines work. Nevertheless, in the following sections, let\u2019s look more closely at the three main hypothetical sources of long-term harm: adjuvants/preservatives, mRNA, and immune activation.\n\n#1: Adjuvants and preservatives\n\nVaccines typical consist of three basic components: a representation of the infectious agent (antigens, weakened viruses, virus particles, mRNA, etc.), an adjuvant that simulates the immune system and/or aids in delivery of the antigen, mRNA, etc., and preservatives (usually salts, metals, and sugars) to avoid contamination and stabilize the other components.\n\nThe later two categories (adjuvants and preservatives) are historically the things that anti-vaccers have targeted (e.g., the infamous, and completely false, accusation that thimerosal [ethyl-mercury] caused autism). These accusations have, however, never stood up to scrutiny. Vaccine components have been well-studied and are safe at the doses used in vaccines.\n\nSpecifically for COVID vaccines, their components differ from one vaccine to the next, but the safety of the components is well-known. Many of them use standard salts/metals that have been used in numerous previous vaccines and medications, and the non-mRNA vaccines usually use the adjuvants that have already been used in other vaccines.\n\nSpecifically for the mRNA vaccines, they use a different type of antigen known as a \u201clipid nanoparticle\u201d (basically a small, fancy fat) that stimulates the immune system and serves as a delivery mechanism for the mRNA. These are new for a commercially available vaccines (because we\u2019ve never had commercially available mRNA vaccines before), but that doesn\u2019t make the nanoparticles themselves new, and there is a wealth of studies on them (including studies on other vaccines that have been being developed [see previous section on the history of mRNA vaccines]). See Hou et al. (2021) for an extensive review of the topic.\n\nMy point is simply that while the vaccines are \u201cnew,\u201d their components have been well-studied, and there is simply no reason to think that they pose a long-term danger.\n\n#2: mRNA\n\nNow let\u2019s turn our attention to the big one that has so many people worried: mRNA. At the outset, we need to be clear on what mRNA is and which it does. Your cells contain DNA stored in the nucleus. This provides the plans for your body and how it runs, and it is what you pass on to make your offspring when you procreate. For the actual day-to-day running of your body, however, it has to be transcribed into mRNA (aka \u201cmessenger RNA\u201d). This is a single stranded copy of your double-stranded DNA. The mRNA can then leave the nucleus and go to the ribosomes (little protein factories in your cells) which translate the mRNA into amino acids which are then strung together and folded to form proteins. This is happing millions of times in your body each second. Importantly, the process does not alter your DNA. Your genetic code is unaffected. Think of it like taking a master copy of a recipe, photocopying it, then giving that photocopy to someone who then follows the instructions on it.\n\nViruses are actually pretty neat and replicate by tapping into this system. They can\u2019t reproduce on their own. Instead, they insert their DNA or RNA into your cells and hijack your molecular machinery by making the ribosomes translate their RNA and build new virus (some viruses have DNA and require a transcription step, others [like COVID] store their genetic material as RNA).\n\nThe mRNA vaccines tap into this same process. They include a small fragment of the RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus (specifically for the spike protein), thus causing your cells to produce that spike protein. Your immune system is then stimulated to attack the spike protein, and in the process, it learns to attack the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus. Take a minute to stop and marvel at the ingenuity of this system, because it\u2019s incredible.\n\nThere are several important points that need to be made here:\n\nThis process does not alter your DNA. The viral mRNA does not get integrated into your DNA. This is not gene therapy. All that happens is protein production by ribosomes. Again, this is like handing your cells a photocopy of a set of instructions. mRNA is a very fragile, short-lived molecule. During my PhD, I worked in a laboratory where some people do RNA research, and they often joked that if you looked at the vials the wrong way the RNA would vanish. The point is that the mRNA from the vaccines very quickly breaks down and is removed from your body. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, it is totally gone. The vaccines only contain the mRNA for a single protein. It is impossible for them to cause your body to make the full virus. They simply don\u2019t contain that information. This is a process that is already happening constantly in your body. Right now, you almost certainly have some viruses (even if you are healthy), and those viruses are hijacking your cells with their RNA and forcing your cells to make virus for them. Indeed, unlike with the vaccine, they are making your body produce entire viruses, not just a single protein. Similarly, anytime you become infected with a cold, the flu, etc., your body is exposed to tons of viral RNA which it then translates into proteins (entire viruses) (related to #4) If you become infected with COVID, this process is going to happen anyway, but unlike with the vaccine, your cells are going to produce the entire virus, and, because the virus will be replicating, you will be exposed to substantially more viral RNA for a longer period of time.\n\nThat last point is incredibly important, because it means that any fears you have about the mRNA in the vaccine should be even greater for the virus itself. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to simultaneously downplay the seriousness of COVID while fearing the mRNA in the vaccines, because if you catch COVID, you are going to be exposed to substantially higher doses of viral RNA!\n\nAs you can hopefully see, none of this lends credence to the idea that the vaccine will cause long-term effects. There is simply no mechanism through which the mRNA could cause long-term harm, and even if there was a concern over long-term effects, that concern would be even higher from actually catching COVID!\n\n#3. Immune activation\n\nThe final way in which vaccines could, in concept, cause harm is as a side effect of the inflammatory immune response they stimulate. Indeed, that is the cause of most vaccine side effects. The vaccine sets off a cascade of immune responses, and sometimes your body gets caught in the crossfire, though this rarely causes serious problems.\n\nImportantly, however, this happens while your immune system is being stimulated. This isn\u2019t a pathway that we would expect to not cause any noticeable problems shortly after vaccination, then suddenly cause massive problems down the road. It could, in concept, cause a problem that starts shortly after vaccination and persists long-term, but it\u2019s unlikely to cause problems that don\u2019t appear until months or years later.\n\nThis is important because, again, problems that arise shortly after vaccination and persist aren\u2019t what we are talking about. Those aren\u2019t unknown. Rather, we already know that those are rare because we can detect them shortly after vaccination (see previous section on short-term studies).\n\nFinally, as I\u2019ve alluded to several times already, problems that arise as a result of immune activation should also arise as the result of actual infection with SARS-CoV-2, and they\u2019d usually be expected to be worse or more common from an actual infection. Indeed, that\u2019s exactly what Barda et al. (2021) found.\n\nSo, once again, it makes no sense to fear this as a consequence of the vaccine while downplaying the seriousness of COVID, because infection with COVID is more likely to cause this problem (see Note 2 on absolute risk).\n\nHow long is long enough?\n\nThis is an issue that I\u2019ve written about several times before (e.g., here and here), but in short, the demand for long-term data becomes extremely problematic unless \u201clong-term\u201d is carefully defined and justified beforehand. We already have over a year of data on COVID vaccines, plus many years of data on mRNA vaccines more generally. For most scientists, based on everything we know, that is plenty long enough to be confident in the safety of these vaccines, but if you are going to claim that it is not long enough, the questions become \u201cwhy?\u201d and \u201chow long is long enough?\u201d\n\nAs I said earlier, anti-vacces have used this argument against vaccines for ages, and the problem is that they constantly shift the goal posts. If you show them a 3-year study, they say, \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 5 years.\u201d If you show them a 5-year study, they say \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 10 years.\u201d If you show them a 10-year study, they switch to 15 years, 20 years, etc. They can keep extending it all the way until the end of the human life-span, and beyond the fact that continually shifting the goal posts is an ad hoc fallacy (and this whole thing is an argument from ignorance fallacy), demanding 15 years of data is only slightly more irrational than demanding 10 years, or even 5 years or 3 years.\n\nReally think about this. Given that no vaccine has ever had a wide-spread, serious side effect that only shows up more than a year after vaccination, what is the justification for demanding 3 years of data instead of accepting the year+ of data we have? How is the demand for 3 years of data more logical than a demand for 10 years, or 20 years, or 60 years? All of those are time categories where we\u2019ve never seen a vaccine suddenly cause new problems and for which we have zero reason to expect these vaccines to cause problems. The probability of a long-term effect only showing up over a year after vaccination is pretty close to zero, which means that it is close to zero for 3 years, 5 years, etc.\n\nBad risk assessment\n\nAs I\u2019ve shown throughout this post, there is simply no good evidence to suggest that the COVID vaccines will have serious long-term consequences that only show up in the future. It\u2019s a baseless fear. Meanwhile, we know that COVID itself is very serious. In the USA alone, it has killed over 650,000 people. In 2020, it was the third leading cause of death in the USA, and in early 2021, it briefly spiked to the #1 slot before dropping back to position #3. We should not be downplaying something that is so prevalent and deadly that it is the third leading cause of death. Further, beyond death, many people suffer serious complications from COVID, some of which will likely persist into the future (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020).\n\nTherefore, based on everything we know (which is a lot), risk assessment clearly shows that you are safer with the vaccine than without it, and while it is technically possible that there will be future unknown consequences of the vaccine, these would be even more likely from COVID itself, and it is incredibly unlikely that they will happen from the vaccines and be serious and widespread enough to alter the risk assessment.\n\nBy avoiding the vaccine, you are placing more weight on an unknown and unlikely hypothetical future risk than you are placing on a very real and serious known risk.\n\nSee the following posts for more details including the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument, precautionary principle argument, and COVID comorbidities.\n\nLong-term fears are baseless: The burden of proof\n\nAs I\u2019ve explained throughout, there is not one shred of evidence nor a single logical argument that makes it likely that the vaccines will have unknown long-term consequences. This is a completely made-up concern. This isn\u2019t a situation where we have preliminary data suggesting a concern, or a logical/scientific basis for thinking that there is a risk. Rather, this is a concern that was pulled out of thin air with absolutely no evidence behind it.\n\nFurther, to be clear, the fact that something is new does not make it likely that there are unknown long-term effects. Indeed, everything we know about vaccines and the immune system makes it extremely unlikely that there will be future, unknown, wide-spread, long-term consequences. Is it technically possible? Sure, but there are an infinite number of technically possible things that will probably never happen. \u201cTechnically possible\u201d is not a valid justification for a fear, particularly if that fear will prevent you from taking a medication that greatly lowers your risk of disease and death.\n\nFor future unknown consequences to be a logically valid reason for not vaccinating, the probability of serious consequences occurring would need to be high enough to trump the massive known benefits of the vaccines. We would need some really compelling preliminary evidence to suggest that these future injuries will occur, and we simply don\u2019t have it, not one scrap of it.\n\nI say again, this is a made-up concern. Although it makes a certain amount of sense from the standpoint of the psychology of our panicky primate brains, it is a concern that is not based on any evidence or logic. You can\u2019t just make up a concern, then demand action based on that concern. You need actual evidence to support the concern.\n\nIn medicine (and science more generally), it is not enough to simply say that something is technically possible. Rather, you have to show that there is a reasonable probability of it being true before it makes sense to treat it seriously (this is something known as the \u201cprior probability\u201d).\n\nImagine, for example, that I decide that taking aspirin while drinking soda is dangerous, and when asked to justify that fear, I simply say, \u201cwell we don\u2019t know that it isn\u2019t dangerous. It\u2019s technically possible that it\u2019s dangerous, and look at how many drugs have been recalled because of some complication with another chemical.\u201d\n\nI think that we can all agree that my fear would be irrational, right? In technical terms, it would be an argument from ignorance fallacy. The fact that something is unknown, doesn\u2019t mean that I can act as if that thing is known to be dangerous. There are an infinite number of things that are unknown. There are an infinite number of potential interactions and long-term effects for all treatments, including vitamins, supplements, herbs, etc. There haven\u2019t been, for example, any 30-year studies on the effects of regularly taking most vitamins or supplements, and given that those are taken daily, they are far more likely to cause long-term issues. So why not be concerned about them?\n\nDo you see the point that I am getting at here? The fact that we haven\u2019t looked at 3-year effects of the vaccines (or 5 years, or 10 years, etc.) would only matter if we actually had evidence to suggest that there would be problems down the road, and we don\u2019t have that evidence. Indeed, all of the evidence suggests the opposite. Therefore, this is a baseless fear and the burden of proof is on those who are avoiding the vaccine based on these concerns.\n\nNow you could try to quibble with me and say that, \u201cNo one is saying that there definitely are long-term effects. We are just saying that we don\u2019t know if there are and, therefore, we should not take the vaccine until we do know.\u201d But, again, that doesn\u2019t work for all the reasons that I\u2019ve laid out. A lack of knowledge simply isn\u2019t sufficient in and of itself. This is an abuse of the precautionary principle, and although you may not be claiming that there are, in fact, long term effects, by choosing to avoid the vaccines, you are, nevertheless, acting as if there will be those effects. As explained earlier, that\u2019s bad risk assessment.\n\nI want to conclude this with some questions. If you are not vaccinating because of concerns over unknown long-term effects, ask yourself, \u201cwhy do I have those concerns?\u201d Can you point to any actual data to justify them, or is it simply a fear of the unknown? If the latter, ask yourself how likely it is that those fears will come true. The fact that something is new or unknown doesn\u2019t make it dangerous. Given the very real risk of COVID, the decade+ of research on mRNA vaccines, the decades of research on vaccines in general, the massive studies on the COVID vaccines, and the fact that no vaccine has ever had the type of serious, widespread, unknown, long-term side effect that everyone is so afraid of, does it really make rational sense to avoid the vaccines out of fear of the unknown? Does it really seem more likely that you will be injured by this totally hypothetical and unprecedented vaccine injury than by a virus that is currently the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA?\n\nNotes\n\nNote 1: When we talk about unknown long-term effects, we are not talking about adverse events that happen shortly after vaccination and continue to cause problems into the future (those are proximate events that have long-term consequences). We aren\u2019t talking about something like myocarditis which, in rare cases, occurs shortly after vaccination and (in a small subset of the most extreme cases) can cause long-term damage. We already know that those events are extremely rare, because we\u2019ve already been able to detect them. They aren\u2019t unknown. In other words, because those events are first detected shortly after vaccination, we have been able to test them with the current short-term studies and have shown that they are extremely rare.\n\nNote 2: Barda et al. (2021) was comparing rates among the vaccinated with rates among the infected, not absolute risk. Absolute risk depends on how likely you are to become infected. However, other analyses (e.g., Gargano et al. 2021) have shown that in high-risk countries like the USA, your absolute risk of serious injury and death is lower with the vaccine than without it, even if you are in a low-risk COVID group.\n\nNote 3: There are many false claims floating around about thousands of deaths following vaccination. These claims are based on VAERS which includes anything observed following vaccination and does not establish causation. With millions of people receiving vaccines, it is inevitable that a few thousand will die shortly afterwards just by chance. In the vast majority of cases, there is simply no reason to think that the vaccines were responsible. Similarly, while some of the adverse events reported in VAERS may have been caused by vaccines, most probably weren\u2019t. The database is self-reported (anyone can make entries), and some truly wacky submissions have been included. Further, again, the fact that something happened after vaccination absolutely does not mean that the vaccine caused it (that\u2019s a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy; more details here and here). To quote the CDC \u201cFDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it\u2019s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines\u201d (the bold was in the original). More details on VAERS here.\n\nNote 4: Again, to be 100% clear, we are talking about injuries that won\u2019t show up until later down the road. You certainly can find examples from decades ago where there were issues with a vaccine rollout (particularly concerning polio vaccines), but those issues were immediate, and that\u2019s not what we are talking about here. The COVID vaccines all underwent massive randomized controlled trials and have been carefully monitored following release to the public, and with the hundreds of millions of doses that we have administered, we have a very clear picture of the immediate risks and benefits. Those aren\u2019t unknowns.\n\nRelated posts\n\nLiterature cited",
        "Concern over unknown, future side effects is by far the most common reason I hear people give for why they aren\u2019t vaccinating against COVID. At a quick glance, that may seem reasonable, but when you start really looking into the science, it quickly becomes clear that there is simply no reason to suspect that there will be dangerous long-term consequences of these vaccines. Indeed, based on everything we know about the immune system, vaccines in general, and these vaccines specifically, it is extremely unlikely that they will cause unknown, serious, wide-spread side effects in the future, and the known risks from COVID far outweigh the hypothetical risks from the vaccines.\n\nIn this post, I\u2019m going to carefully go over the science and logic that allows us to be so confident in the long-term safety of these vaccines, but before I do that, I want to briefly explain who my target audience is here, namely, the \u201cvaccine hesitant.\u201d I am refereeing to the people who usually would not consider themselves \u201canti-vaccers\u201d and would usually vaccinate themselves and their children but have been swept up in the maelstrom of misinformation and fear about the new COVID vaccines. If you are someone who is truly seeking information and trying to think for yourself, then please hear me out and seriously consider the arguments and evidence that I am going to present. Do not give in to the baseless fearmongering that is rampaging through the internet and media.\n\nTo that end, I want to point out right at the start that this tactic of stirring up fear of future, unknown, long-term consequences is not new or unique to COVID vaccines. It is straight out of the traditional anti-vaccine playbook. It is something I was writing about long before COVID, and the argument is just as flawed now as it was then. So, if you are someone who eschews the title \u201canti-vaccer,\u201d but are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of the arguments about unknown, long-term effects, please realize that these are not new arguments that arose out of legitimate concerns specifically about COVID vaccines. Rather, stoking fear of future unknowns is a standard (and flawed) anti-vaccer tactic that they have been using for decades and are now dressing up and presenting as if it is a novel concern for COVID vaccines. Do not be fooled by this tactic.\n\nThis post is necessarily long, because there\u2019s a lot to talk about in order to cover this topic properly, but, again, I have written this for people who are truly trying to think for themselves, and are truly seeking information. So if that is you, please read this carefully in its entirety.\n\nBecause of the length of this post, I will summarize key points in bullets below, before elaborating on each of them.\n\nSummary: TL;DR\n\nmRNA vaccines have been being studied for over a decade (including human trials). Current COVID vaccines have been extremely well studied, with sample sizes of hundreds of thousands of people, and studies have been compiled into large meta-analyses/systematic reviews. Thus, the short-term risks of the vaccines are extremely well-documented, and the benefits outweigh the risks. The only \u201cunknown\u201d is about long-term effects; however\u2026 No vaccine has ever caused the type of widespread, serious side effect years down the road that everyone is afraid of. Nearly all side effects occur shortly after vaccination (see #2). The only example of a sided effect that showed up months later appear within a year (whereas we\u2019ve been using COVID vaccines for over a year) and was rare. The vaccine benefits still outweighed the risks. Vaccines rarely cause long-term (future) side effects because they use low doses over a short time. Vaccines simply train your immune system. Vaccines are quickly removed from the body. Most vaccine components were well-studied, and their safety is known. mRNA: mRNA does not alter your DNA. mRNA is very quickly broken down and removed. mRNA in vaccines cannot make your body produce entire viruses. You are constantly exposed to mRNA from viruses (e.g., from colds) If you catch COVID, your cells will use viral mRNA to make proteins just like they do from the vaccine, but\u2026 Your cells will make entire viruses, not just a single protein. You will be exposed to far higher levels of mRNA. Side effects from immune stimulation will usually happen right away and will usually be worse from actual infection with COVID. A demand for long-term studies is meaningless unless you can justify why a particular length of time is needed. No matter how long something has been studied, it is always technically possible that an effect won\u2019t show up until slightly after the length of that study. This is true for all medications, foods, minerals, vitamins, etc., yet we don\u2019t fear most of them. Therefore, you must provide actual evidence or reasoning to think that a futre side-effect is actually likely. Focusing on a highly-unlikely, unknown, hypothetical risk from the vaccine while downplaying the very real and serious risk from COVID is bad risk assessment. Fears over unknown long-term effects of the vaccines are baseless. The burden of proof is on anyone claiming that the vaccines are dangerous.\n\nNot as new as you might think\n\nBefore we go into the details of the COVID vaccines, we need some background information to put them in context, and I think it is important to point out that these vaccine technologies are not as new as people are often led to believe. Sure, these exact vaccines were developed recently, but mRNA vaccines have been being developed and tested for years. Thus, the underlying technology is well-studied.\n\nLet me direct you to a review paper published in 2018 (before COVID) titled, \u201cmRNA vaccines \u2014 a new era in vaccinology\u201d (Pardi et al. 2018). This review covers over a decade of research on mRNA vaccines, including safety and efficiency trials on mice (Fleeton 2001; Geall et al. 2012; Magini et al. 2016), ferrets (Brazzoli et al. 2015), pigs (Schnee et al. 2016), monkeys (Brito et al. 2014), and yes, even humans (Craenenbroeck et al. 2015; Bahl 2017; Alberer et al. 2017). As you\u2019d expect in a rapidly growing field, even more studies were published following that review, (but prior to COVID). Feldman et al. (2019), for example tested mRNA influenza vaccines in over 200 people, including following them for a full year after the vaccines to assess safety and effectiveness. Similarly, studies like Alberer et al. (2017) followed patients for a year prior to publishing and continued to follow them after publication.\n\nTo be clear, those human trials were small trials; my point is simply that we were able to develop these COVID vaccines so quickly not by rushing, but rather by utilizing a robust body of research that had already been conducted. All of the information was there, waiting to be applied to something like COVID.\n\nThe way that people (including politicians and the media) are talking about these vaccines, you\u2019d think that they represent totally uncharted territory. Reading the comments on my page, people are acting like we have almost no knowledge about them and are shooting in the dark, recklessly plowing into the unknown, but that\u2019s simply not true. In reality, we knew a ton about mRNA vaccines before COVID, and that should really change your perspective on these vaccines.\n\nIt is so easy to give into fear of the unknown, particularly when you are so constantly bombarded with people\u2019s concerns. I don\u2019t blame anyone for that;\u2019 it\u2019s human nature, but it\u2019s important that we use logic and facts to overcome our base fears, and if you step back and start to rationally look at the wealth of knowledge these vaccines were based on (including human trials spanning a year or more), that really should paint these vaccines in a different light and help to alleviate those fears.\n\nNote that I only cited a small handful of the studies that had been conducted prior to COVID.\n\nWhat we know: proximate (short-term) side effects\n\nThe crux of the concern over these vaccines is fear of the unknown, so before we can talk about the unknown, we need to be clear on what we do know, as well as clearly defining what we mean by \u201cunknown, long-term effects.\u201d\n\nThere are basically two categories of effects we need to talk about:\n\nProximate effects (short-term) = effects that first occur shortly after vaccination\n\nUnknown future effects (long-term) = effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination (Note 1)\n\nIt is important to make this distinction, because I often find that people meander back and forth between these two without having a clear understanding of what is actually known or how it is known. So let me try to be as clear as possible: we have an extremely robust understanding of proximate effects, and the fact that the vaccines are new is 100% irrelevant.\n\nProximate effects are fairly straightforward to test. First, scientists conduct phase 1\u20133 human trials using a randomized, placebo-controlled approach, where they follow thousands of patients for several weeks following vaccination. Then, once the vaccine is released to the general public, scientists continue to monitor it for side effects using things like large cohort studies and case-controlled studies. As the sample sizes increase, so does our ability to detect increasingly rare events. With tens of thousands of participants, we can detect events that occur every few thousand people, but we will miss events that happen once for every 10,000 people. At a few hundred thousand people, we can detect events that occur once per tens of thousands of people, but will miss events that happen once for every 100,000 people, etc. (Note: numbers are approximations).\n\nThere are two critical points here. First, because our ability to detect rare side effects is dependent on sample size, as the sample size increases, any new side effects will, by definition, be increasingly rare. By the time we are into the millions (as we are with COVID vaccines) we aren\u2019t going to suddenly find a new common serious side effect, because those would have been picked up at much smaller sample sizes.\n\nSecond, the novelty of the vaccines is completely and totally irrelevant. Because we are talking about events that happen within a few weeks of being vaccinated, it does not matter if the vaccines have been available for two months or two hundred years. The only thing that matters is the sample size (i.e., number of participants). Let me say that again (in bold), our ability to confidently know the rates of proximate side effects depends entirely on the sample size; the age of the vaccine is 100% irrelevant.\n\nIn the case of COVID, we were able to get these sample sizes extremely quickly because there were so many cases of COVID and governments dumped so much money into massive vaccine campaigns. All of the currently recommended vaccines passed their initial phase 3 trials with large sample sizes. For example, Pfizer used over 43,000 participants (Polack et al. 2020), and Moderna used over 30,000 (Mahase 2020).\n\nFollowing those phase 3 trials, numerous large studies have been released. Indeed, so many studies have been conducted that we can do systematic reviews and meta-analyses. As explained here, these combine the data from multiple studies to look for overarching effects and are the highest level of scientific evidence. Qianhui et al. (2021), for example, included 87 different safety studies, and concluded that, \u201cAvailable evidence indicates that eligible COVID-19 vaccines have an acceptable short-term safety profile.\u201d\n\nYet more studies have been conducted since that review/meta-analysis, and some of them are truly massive. Barda et al. (2021), for example, compared over 800,000 vaccinated individuals to over 800,000 unvaccinated individuals to look at the rates of adverse events from the Pfizer vaccine as well as the rates of those same events in people who develop COVID. Not only did the vaccine have low rates of serious side effects, but, for most conditions (including myocarditis and myocardial infarction), the rates of those events were higher in people who caught COVID than in people who received vaccines (Note 2).\n\nOther calculations of the rates of specific adverse events have had even large sample sizes. For example, the Israel Ministry of Health used over 5 million people to calculate the rate of myocarditis following vaccination. Similarly, in the USA, the CDC has several hundred million vaccine doses to use in its calculations.\n\nThe point is that we are extremely confident about the short-term consequences of the vaccines. It\u2019s hard to overstate the massive volume of data we have. Barda et al. (2021), for example, is one of largest cohort studies I have ever read. It is larger than most studies on the safety of well-established vaccines that have been available for decades. Indeed, we have been able to quickly collect so much data that our knowledge of the short-term safety of COVID vaccines is equal to or greater than our knowledge of the short-term safety of many standard vaccines.\n\nAgain, to be 100% clear, the fact that the vaccines are relatively new simply does not matter for these short-term effects. Further, these studies aren\u2019t the result of \u201crushing.\u201d Rather, it is simply matter of vaccinating so many people so quickly that we were able to rapidly collect the data that would usually take years to accumulate. It is the size and volume of the studies that matters, and we have numerous truly massive studies unequivocally showing that serious side effects are rare and the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nTo put it simply, the short-term side effects of the COVID vaccines have been thoroughly studied and are extremely well-documented. Scientifically, these vaccines are no longer experimental (with the exception of their application to young children, in some cases). They have already passed numerous experiments and the evidence is clear (Pfizer isn\u2019t \u201cexperimental\u201d legally either). Insisting that we haven\u2019t studied the vaccines well-enough to know the short-term side effects is, at this stage, science denial.\n\nSee Note 3 regarding the supposed vaccine-related deaths and injuries reported in VAERS.\n\nVaccines don\u2019t cause wide-spread, long-term adverse events\n\nNow we can finally turn our attention specifically to the topic of unknown, long-term effects (which, remember, are effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination; Note 1). I realize I took a long time getting here, but that background was important, because I have shown that we have a massive body of studies showing that the COVID vaccines have few serious side effects shortly after receiving them. Thus, the only way to doubt their safety without outright science denial is to raise concerns over presently unknown, long-term effects, but, as I will show, those concerns have no scientific merit.\n\nThe type of future long-term consequence that everyone seems so afraid of (i.e., the type that only manifests months or years down the road) is virtually unheard of from vaccines. I looked long and hard for examples of this occurring, and in the entire history of vaccines, I was only able to find one: Pandemrix, an H1N1 vaccine used in Europe for the 2009\u20132010 flu season was associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy that usually only manifested weeks or months after the vaccine. You can read more details on Thoughtscapism and Skeptical Raptor, but there are just three points I want to make.\n\nDepending on the study, the lag between vaccination and onset of narcolepsy was 0-242 days (median = 42; Partinen et al. 2012) or 0-360 days (median not reported; Nohynek et al. 2012). Pfizer and Moderna both began their phase 3 COVID vaccine trials on 27 July 2020 (~400 days ago) and received emergency use authorization (thus starting mass vaccination campaigns in the USA) in December 2020 (~260 days ago). Indeed, Israel had already administered over 1 million doses by the end of 2020. This means we are already past the time frame where we should have started picking up something comparable to the long-term effects of Pandemrix. As is so often the case with vaccine side effects, the disease they prevent (influenza in this case) also causes the same side effect. This side effects was rare (between 1 in 52,000 doses and 1 in 57,500 doses in England [Miller et al. 2013] and 1 in 16,000 in Finland [Nohynek et al. 2012; for unclear reasons, Finland had a high rate that could not be generalized to other countries), and the benefits of the vaccine still outweighed the risk.\n\nThat last point is really important, because for it to turn out that avoiding the COVID vaccines was the safer choice, unknown future side effects would not only have to exist, but they would have to be so common and so serious that they outweigh the enormous known benefits of the vaccines, and that is a situation that has never occurred for any vaccine (Note 4). For reasons that I\u2019ll explain in the next sections, that\u2019s simply not how vaccines interact with the body.\n\nSo, if you are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of a fear of unknown, serious, long-term side effects, ask yourself, is that fear really rational given that future, long-term side effects of vaccines are virtually unheard of, and there has never been a case where those side effects were widespread and outweighed the benefits of the vaccines?\n\nWhy vaccines don\u2019t cause future long-term effects: Low dose, short exposure\n\nLet\u2019s now talk about why vaccine side effects nearly always show up shortly after vaccination. The type of long-term consequence we are talking about typically comes from one of two causes: a very large dose over a short time, or a small dose over a prolonged period of time. Vaccines don\u2019t fit either of those categories. They are fundamentally different from most medications because they simply train your immune system before being quickly removed. Your own immune system is what provides a lasting benefit. Further, vaccines do this via low, non-toxic doses. Remember, the dose makes the poison. Everything, even water (Garigan and Ristedt 1999), is toxic at a high enough dose and safe at a low enough dose. So people who scream about \u201cTOXIC CHEMICALS\u201d in vaccines are ignoring basic chemistry. There is no such thing as a toxic chemical, there are only toxic doses, and the doses in vaccines are not toxic.\n\nOne of the most common arguments I hear people making to justify concerns over COVID vaccines is, \u201clook at all the examples of drugs that were approved, then years later long-term effects were found.\u201d Those examples are, however, nearly always for drugs that were taken repeatedly. It\u2019s the cumulative effect that causes the risk (particularly for chemicals that persist in your body for long periods of time). Vaccines, in contrast, have limited exposure, and your body quickly eliminates them. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, the vaccine itself has been totally eliminated from your body. The long-term protection comes from immune system memory, not from the vaccines themselves.\n\nThis is really important, because it means we don\u2019t have a mechanism through which COVID vaccines would cause long-term harm. Because vaccines are a low doses given 2-3 times, we expect any consequences to happen quickly, which is exactly what we find. The most common side effects are things like soreness and moderate flu symptoms that start within a few hours or days of receiving the vaccine. These effects aren\u2019t because the vaccine is \u201ctoxic\u201d but rather because it is doing exactly what it was designed to do and stimulating your immune system. It\u2019s that activation of your immune system that makes you feel unwell, but that activation is critical, because it is how your immune system learns to identify and fight COVID. Similarly, serious side effects from the vaccines, while rare, usually show up shortly after vaccination.\n\nSide effects that don\u2019t show up for months or years simply aren\u2019t expected from vaccines because of how vaccines work. Nevertheless, in the following sections, let\u2019s look more closely at the three main hypothetical sources of long-term harm: adjuvants/preservatives, mRNA, and immune activation.\n\n#1: Adjuvants and preservatives\n\nVaccines typical consist of three basic components: a representation of the infectious agent (antigens, weakened viruses, virus particles, mRNA, etc.), an adjuvant that simulates the immune system and/or aids in delivery of the antigen, mRNA, etc., and preservatives (usually salts, metals, and sugars) to avoid contamination and stabilize the other components.\n\nThe later two categories (adjuvants and preservatives) are historically the things that anti-vaccers have targeted (e.g., the infamous, and completely false, accusation that thimerosal [ethyl-mercury] caused autism). These accusations have, however, never stood up to scrutiny. Vaccine components have been well-studied and are safe at the doses used in vaccines.\n\nSpecifically for COVID vaccines, their components differ from one vaccine to the next, but the safety of the components is well-known. Many of them use standard salts/metals that have been used in numerous previous vaccines and medications, and the non-mRNA vaccines usually use the adjuvants that have already been used in other vaccines.\n\nSpecifically for the mRNA vaccines, they use a different type of antigen known as a \u201clipid nanoparticle\u201d (basically a small, fancy fat) that stimulates the immune system and serves as a delivery mechanism for the mRNA. These are new for a commercially available vaccines (because we\u2019ve never had commercially available mRNA vaccines before), but that doesn\u2019t make the nanoparticles themselves new, and there is a wealth of studies on them (including studies on other vaccines that have been being developed [see previous section on the history of mRNA vaccines]). See Hou et al. (2021) for an extensive review of the topic.\n\nMy point is simply that while the vaccines are \u201cnew,\u201d their components have been well-studied, and there is simply no reason to think that they pose a long-term danger.\n\n#2: mRNA\n\nNow let\u2019s turn our attention to the big one that has so many people worried: mRNA. At the outset, we need to be clear on what mRNA is and which it does. Your cells contain DNA stored in the nucleus. This provides the plans for your body and how it runs, and it is what you pass on to make your offspring when you procreate. For the actual day-to-day running of your body, however, it has to be transcribed into mRNA (aka \u201cmessenger RNA\u201d). This is a single stranded copy of your double-stranded DNA. The mRNA can then leave the nucleus and go to the ribosomes (little protein factories in your cells) which translate the mRNA into amino acids which are then strung together and folded to form proteins. This is happing millions of times in your body each second. Importantly, the process does not alter your DNA. Your genetic code is unaffected. Think of it like taking a master copy of a recipe, photocopying it, then giving that photocopy to someone who then follows the instructions on it.\n\nViruses are actually pretty neat and replicate by tapping into this system. They can\u2019t reproduce on their own. Instead, they insert their DNA or RNA into your cells and hijack your molecular machinery by making the ribosomes translate their RNA and build new virus (some viruses have DNA and require a transcription step, others [like COVID] store their genetic material as RNA).\n\nThe mRNA vaccines tap into this same process. They include a small fragment of the RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus (specifically for the spike protein), thus causing your cells to produce that spike protein. Your immune system is then stimulated to attack the spike protein, and in the process, it learns to attack the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus. Take a minute to stop and marvel at the ingenuity of this system, because it\u2019s incredible.\n\nThere are several important points that need to be made here:\n\nThis process does not alter your DNA. The viral mRNA does not get integrated into your DNA. This is not gene therapy. All that happens is protein production by ribosomes. Again, this is like handing your cells a photocopy of a set of instructions. mRNA is a very fragile, short-lived molecule. During my PhD, I worked in a laboratory where some people do RNA research, and they often joked that if you looked at the vials the wrong way the RNA would vanish. The point is that the mRNA from the vaccines very quickly breaks down and is removed from your body. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, it is totally gone. The vaccines only contain the mRNA for a single protein. It is impossible for them to cause your body to make the full virus. They simply don\u2019t contain that information. This is a process that is already happening constantly in your body. Right now, you almost certainly have some viruses (even if you are healthy), and those viruses are hijacking your cells with their RNA and forcing your cells to make virus for them. Indeed, unlike with the vaccine, they are making your body produce entire viruses, not just a single protein. Similarly, anytime you become infected with a cold, the flu, etc., your body is exposed to tons of viral RNA which it then translates into proteins (entire viruses) (related to #4) If you become infected with COVID, this process is going to happen anyway, but unlike with the vaccine, your cells are going to produce the entire virus, and, because the virus will be replicating, you will be exposed to substantially more viral RNA for a longer period of time.\n\nThat last point is incredibly important, because it means that any fears you have about the mRNA in the vaccine should be even greater for the virus itself. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to simultaneously downplay the seriousness of COVID while fearing the mRNA in the vaccines, because if you catch COVID, you are going to be exposed to substantially higher doses of viral RNA!\n\nAs you can hopefully see, none of this lends credence to the idea that the vaccine will cause long-term effects. There is simply no mechanism through which the mRNA could cause long-term harm, and even if there was a concern over long-term effects, that concern would be even higher from actually catching COVID!\n\n#3. Immune activation\n\nThe final way in which vaccines could, in concept, cause harm is as a side effect of the inflammatory immune response they stimulate. Indeed, that is the cause of most vaccine side effects. The vaccine sets off a cascade of immune responses, and sometimes your body gets caught in the crossfire, though this rarely causes serious problems.\n\nImportantly, however, this happens while your immune system is being stimulated. This isn\u2019t a pathway that we would expect to not cause any noticeable problems shortly after vaccination, then suddenly cause massive problems down the road. It could, in concept, cause a problem that starts shortly after vaccination and persists long-term, but it\u2019s unlikely to cause problems that don\u2019t appear until months or years later.\n\nThis is important because, again, problems that arise shortly after vaccination and persist aren\u2019t what we are talking about. Those aren\u2019t unknown. Rather, we already know that those are rare because we can detect them shortly after vaccination (see previous section on short-term studies).\n\nFinally, as I\u2019ve alluded to several times already, problems that arise as a result of immune activation should also arise as the result of actual infection with SARS-CoV-2, and they\u2019d usually be expected to be worse or more common from an actual infection. Indeed, that\u2019s exactly what Barda et al. (2021) found.\n\nSo, once again, it makes no sense to fear this as a consequence of the vaccine while downplaying the seriousness of COVID, because infection with COVID is more likely to cause this problem (see Note 2 on absolute risk).\n\nHow long is long enough?\n\nThis is an issue that I\u2019ve written about several times before (e.g., here and here), but in short, the demand for long-term data becomes extremely problematic unless \u201clong-term\u201d is carefully defined and justified beforehand. We already have over a year of data on COVID vaccines, plus many years of data on mRNA vaccines more generally. For most scientists, based on everything we know, that is plenty long enough to be confident in the safety of these vaccines, but if you are going to claim that it is not long enough, the questions become \u201cwhy?\u201d and \u201chow long is long enough?\u201d\n\nAs I said earlier, anti-vacces have used this argument against vaccines for ages, and the problem is that they constantly shift the goal posts. If you show them a 3-year study, they say, \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 5 years.\u201d If you show them a 5-year study, they say \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 10 years.\u201d If you show them a 10-year study, they switch to 15 years, 20 years, etc. They can keep extending it all the way until the end of the human life-span, and beyond the fact that continually shifting the goal posts is an ad hoc fallacy (and this whole thing is an argument from ignorance fallacy), demanding 15 years of data is only slightly more irrational than demanding 10 years, or even 5 years or 3 years.\n\nReally think about this. Given that no vaccine has ever had a wide-spread, serious side effect that only shows up more than a year after vaccination, what is the justification for demanding 3 years of data instead of accepting the year+ of data we have? How is the demand for 3 years of data more logical than a demand for 10 years, or 20 years, or 60 years? All of those are time categories where we\u2019ve never seen a vaccine suddenly cause new problems and for which we have zero reason to expect these vaccines to cause problems. The probability of a long-term effect only showing up over a year after vaccination is pretty close to zero, which means that it is close to zero for 3 years, 5 years, etc.\n\nBad risk assessment\n\nAs I\u2019ve shown throughout this post, there is simply no good evidence to suggest that the COVID vaccines will have serious long-term consequences that only show up in the future. It\u2019s a baseless fear. Meanwhile, we know that COVID itself is very serious. In the USA alone, it has killed over 650,000 people. In 2020, it was the third leading cause of death in the USA, and in early 2021, it briefly spiked to the #1 slot before dropping back to position #3. We should not be downplaying something that is so prevalent and deadly that it is the third leading cause of death. Further, beyond death, many people suffer serious complications from COVID, some of which will likely persist into the future (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020).\n\nTherefore, based on everything we know (which is a lot), risk assessment clearly shows that you are safer with the vaccine than without it, and while it is technically possible that there will be future unknown consequences of the vaccine, these would be even more likely from COVID itself, and it is incredibly unlikely that they will happen from the vaccines and be serious and widespread enough to alter the risk assessment.\n\nBy avoiding the vaccine, you are placing more weight on an unknown and unlikely hypothetical future risk than you are placing on a very real and serious known risk.\n\nSee the following posts for more details including the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument, precautionary principle argument, and COVID comorbidities.\n\nLong-term fears are baseless: The burden of proof\n\nAs I\u2019ve explained throughout, there is not one shred of evidence nor a single logical argument that makes it likely that the vaccines will have unknown long-term consequences. This is a completely made-up concern. This isn\u2019t a situation where we have preliminary data suggesting a concern, or a logical/scientific basis for thinking that there is a risk. Rather, this is a concern that was pulled out of thin air with absolutely no evidence behind it.\n\nFurther, to be clear, the fact that something is new does not make it likely that there are unknown long-term effects. Indeed, everything we know about vaccines and the immune system makes it extremely unlikely that there will be future, unknown, wide-spread, long-term consequences. Is it technically possible? Sure, but there are an infinite number of technically possible things that will probably never happen. \u201cTechnically possible\u201d is not a valid justification for a fear, particularly if that fear will prevent you from taking a medication that greatly lowers your risk of disease and death.\n\nFor future unknown consequences to be a logically valid reason for not vaccinating, the probability of serious consequences occurring would need to be high enough to trump the massive known benefits of the vaccines. We would need some really compelling preliminary evidence to suggest that these future injuries will occur, and we simply don\u2019t have it, not one scrap of it.\n\nI say again, this is a made-up concern. Although it makes a certain amount of sense from the standpoint of the psychology of our panicky primate brains, it is a concern that is not based on any evidence or logic. You can\u2019t just make up a concern, then demand action based on that concern. You need actual evidence to support the concern.\n\nIn medicine (and science more generally), it is not enough to simply say that something is technically possible. Rather, you have to show that there is a reasonable probability of it being true before it makes sense to treat it seriously (this is something known as the \u201cprior probability\u201d).\n\nImagine, for example, that I decide that taking aspirin while drinking soda is dangerous, and when asked to justify that fear, I simply say, \u201cwell we don\u2019t know that it isn\u2019t dangerous. It\u2019s technically possible that it\u2019s dangerous, and look at how many drugs have been recalled because of some complication with another chemical.\u201d\n\nI think that we can all agree that my fear would be irrational, right? In technical terms, it would be an argument from ignorance fallacy. The fact that something is unknown, doesn\u2019t mean that I can act as if that thing is known to be dangerous. There are an infinite number of things that are unknown. There are an infinite number of potential interactions and long-term effects for all treatments, including vitamins, supplements, herbs, etc. There haven\u2019t been, for example, any 30-year studies on the effects of regularly taking most vitamins or supplements, and given that those are taken daily, they are far more likely to cause long-term issues. So why not be concerned about them?\n\nDo you see the point that I am getting at here? The fact that we haven\u2019t looked at 3-year effects of the vaccines (or 5 years, or 10 years, etc.) would only matter if we actually had evidence to suggest that there would be problems down the road, and we don\u2019t have that evidence. Indeed, all of the evidence suggests the opposite. Therefore, this is a baseless fear and the burden of proof is on those who are avoiding the vaccine based on these concerns.\n\nNow you could try to quibble with me and say that, \u201cNo one is saying that there definitely are long-term effects. We are just saying that we don\u2019t know if there are and, therefore, we should not take the vaccine until we do know.\u201d But, again, that doesn\u2019t work for all the reasons that I\u2019ve laid out. A lack of knowledge simply isn\u2019t sufficient in and of itself. This is an abuse of the precautionary principle, and although you may not be claiming that there are, in fact, long term effects, by choosing to avoid the vaccines, you are, nevertheless, acting as if there will be those effects. As explained earlier, that\u2019s bad risk assessment.\n\nI want to conclude this with some questions. If you are not vaccinating because of concerns over unknown long-term effects, ask yourself, \u201cwhy do I have those concerns?\u201d Can you point to any actual data to justify them, or is it simply a fear of the unknown? If the latter, ask yourself how likely it is that those fears will come true. The fact that something is new or unknown doesn\u2019t make it dangerous. Given the very real risk of COVID, the decade+ of research on mRNA vaccines, the decades of research on vaccines in general, the massive studies on the COVID vaccines, and the fact that no vaccine has ever had the type of serious, widespread, unknown, long-term side effect that everyone is so afraid of, does it really make rational sense to avoid the vaccines out of fear of the unknown? Does it really seem more likely that you will be injured by this totally hypothetical and unprecedented vaccine injury than by a virus that is currently the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA?\n\nNotes\n\nNote 1: When we talk about unknown long-term effects, we are not talking about adverse events that happen shortly after vaccination and continue to cause problems into the future (those are proximate events that have long-term consequences). We aren\u2019t talking about something like myocarditis which, in rare cases, occurs shortly after vaccination and (in a small subset of the most extreme cases) can cause long-term damage. We already know that those events are extremely rare, because we\u2019ve already been able to detect them. They aren\u2019t unknown. In other words, because those events are first detected shortly after vaccination, we have been able to test them with the current short-term studies and have shown that they are extremely rare.\n\nNote 2: Barda et al. (2021) was comparing rates among the vaccinated with rates among the infected, not absolute risk. Absolute risk depends on how likely you are to become infected. However, other analyses (e.g., Gargano et al. 2021) have shown that in high-risk countries like the USA, your absolute risk of serious injury and death is lower with the vaccine than without it, even if you are in a low-risk COVID group.\n\nNote 3: There are many false claims floating around about thousands of deaths following vaccination. These claims are based on VAERS which includes anything observed following vaccination and does not establish causation. With millions of people receiving vaccines, it is inevitable that a few thousand will die shortly afterwards just by chance. In the vast majority of cases, there is simply no reason to think that the vaccines were responsible. Similarly, while some of the adverse events reported in VAERS may have been caused by vaccines, most probably weren\u2019t. The database is self-reported (anyone can make entries), and some truly wacky submissions have been included. Further, again, the fact that something happened after vaccination absolutely does not mean that the vaccine caused it (that\u2019s a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy; more details here and here). To quote the CDC \u201cFDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it\u2019s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines\u201d (the bold was in the original). More details on VAERS here.\n\nNote 4: Again, to be 100% clear, we are talking about injuries that won\u2019t show up until later down the road. You certainly can find examples from decades ago where there were issues with a vaccine rollout (particularly concerning polio vaccines), but those issues were immediate, and that\u2019s not what we are talking about here. The COVID vaccines all underwent massive randomized controlled trials and have been carefully monitored following release to the public, and with the hundreds of millions of doses that we have administered, we have a very clear picture of the immediate risks and benefits. Those aren\u2019t unknowns.\n\nRelated posts\n\nLiterature cited"

        "Recently, the CDC released data on COVID comorbidities, including data showing that 6% of COVID-19 deaths only listed COVID on the death certificate, while the remaining 94% of COVID deaths also listed other conditions. Many have jumped on this as proof that COVID is far less deadly than previously claimed, and they are arguing that most reported COVID deaths are actually just people who died of some other condition while happening to have COVID. In particular, I keep seeing an analogy of someone who has COVID getting hit by a car, then the death being attributed to COVID. This is a very bad analogy (and faulty argument in general) that horribly mischaracterizes these data. So, I want to briefly explain what is actually going on.\n\nFirst, you need to realize that when a patient dies, doctors list all of the factors that contributed to the death. This often includes multiple conditions, at which point we call them \u201ccomorbidities.\u201d In the case of COVID, two main things are happening. First, in some cases, people have a pre-existing condition that interacts with COVID and makes them more likely to die from COVID. Second, COVID leads to conditions that then contribute to the death.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the pre-existing condition situation. We know that people with some health conditions are more prone to die from COVID than people without those conditions, because those conditions make them more vulnerable to COVID. Thus, there is an interaction between COVID and the pre-existing condition, with both contributing to the death. Importantly, however, in most cases, the person would not have died at this particular point in time had it not been for COVID. In other words, something like an existing respiratory problem makes people more sensitive to COVID, resulting in a higher death rate when infected with COVID. That does not mean that COVID wasn\u2019t a key factor in their deaths. It is simply that it was not the only factor.\n\nBy way of analogy, imagine that someone with asthma gets trapped in an environment with lots of smog, ultimately resulting in an inability to breathe and subsequent death. What killed them? Well, both the asthma and the smog played a role. The smog was a serious problem because of the asthma, but conversely, they could have kept on living with the asthma had it not been for the smog. If we could have prevented them form being exposed to the smog, they would have lived.\n\nEven so, for many people, COVID is fatal because of interactions with other conditions, but that still means that COVID was fatal. It still means that they would have lived had it not been for COVID.\n\nTo give one final analogy, imagine a disease that is far deadlier in men than in women. Imagine that we look at the mortality statistics form that disease and see that 94% of deaths were from men. It would clearly be absurd to say, \u201cthey didn\u2019t die form the disease, it was being a male that killed them.\u201d That would obviously be nuts. It would be apparent to everyone that there was an interaction between the disease and sex that causes men to be more sensitive to it. Even so, there are interactions between many pre-existing conditions and COVID that make people with those conditions more sensitive to COVID and more likely to die from it.\n\nOn the flip side, many of the reported comorbidities are actually caused by COVID. Look at the data from the CDC. The single most common comorbidity category* (68,004) was influenza/pneumonia. These diseases are often secondary infections that happen as a result of viral infections. Similarly, respiratory failure was present in 54,803 cases. Again, this is something that we know COVID causes. So many of these comorbidities are actually caused by COVID!\n\n*Technically, the most common category was \u201cother\u201d which includes a very wide range of conditions that were grouped together because each was too uncommon to merit its own category. Thus the influenza/pneumonia category was the most common category for discrete diseases, rather than the large hodgepodge of conditions.\n\nBy way of analogy, the argument being made by science deniers is no different from someone bleeding out from a gunshot wound, then someone else saying, \u201cbullets aren\u2019t dangerous, because she died from blood loss, not the bullet.\u201d That\u2019s obviously a dumb argument. She only lost the blood because of the bullet. Even so, many people are only dying from conditions like respiratory failure or heart failure because of COVID19.\n\nIt is also worth noting that, as is often the case, this argument is straight out of the anti-vaccine playbook. For diseases like measles, secondary infections with diseases like pneumonia often contribute to children\u2019s deaths. Thus, anti-vaccers incorrectly argue that measles isn\u2019t deadly because the pneumonia is what killed them. Just like COVID and my gunshot example, however, they only developed pneumonia because of measles.\n\nSo now, with all of that in place, let\u2019s circle back the analogy of someone getting hit by a car. I like analogies a lot. I have frequently argued that they are valuable for testing whether consistent reasoning is being applied. However, as I have explained before, for the analogies to be useful, they must follow the same logical structure as the original argument. That is very clearly not the case here. Someone who happens to have COVID getting hit by a car is a very, very different thing from either someone with a pre-existing condition that predisposes them to complications from COVID dying from an interaction between the condition and COVID or COVID itself causing a secondary condition.\n\nDo you see the difference? The vast majority of comorbidities listed are directly related to COVID either as a factor that exacerbates the situation or as a result of COVID. In contrast, the car accident has nothing to do with COVID. They are not analogous, and anyone who would use such a clearly terrible argument obviously does not know what they are talking about.\n\nHaving said all of that, there are almost certainly some cases in this database where COVID truly wasn\u2019t the cause. There are probably some cases where someone who had COVID just happened to have a heat attack that would have happened without the COVID, or where someone who had COVID was in an accident, but when you start looking closely at the data, those are clearly a very tiny minority, and the vast majority of comorbidities relate to COVID. Indeed, beyond these data and all the data looking at how COVID attacks the body, we also know that there have been far more deaths this year in the US than there were during the same time period last year (Weinberger et al. 2020). Indeed, there are more excess deaths than the total number of reported COVID deaths. Understanding exactly what that means is very complicated because there are many contributing factors. We may be underestimating COVID deaths, but also, there may be increased deaths due to factors like people not seeking medical help for conditions for which they normally would seek help. Conversely, things like a decrease in car accidents could pull the number the other direction. However, several pieces of evidence (such as a spike in excess deaths in places that had large outbreaks with many reported COVID deaths; e.g., New York city) indicate the COVID is a key factor in the number of excess deaths seen this year, and it is very unlikely that we are grossly overestimating the COVID mortalities.\n\nAs others have pointed out, the correct way to look at this 6% figure is not that only 6% of reported COVID deaths were actually from COVID. Rather, it means that of all the people who died from COVID, 6% did not have any other reported conditions. In other words, these data show that some people are more vulnerable to COVID than others due to existing health conditions (which we already knew) and COVID often results in secondary problems which contribute to patients\u2019 demise (again, which we already knew). Stop trying to twist science to fit your personal agenda and look rationally at the facts. Think critically and don\u2019t blindly believe something just because you saw it on Facebook or Twitter.",
        "Joint Press Release\n\nThe energy crisis arising from the war in Ukraine may lead to further setbacks\n\nWashington, June 1, 2022 \u2014 The COVID-19 pandemic has been a key factor in slowing progress toward universal energy access. Globally, 733 million people still have no access to electricity, and 2.4 billion people still cook using fuels detrimental to their health and the environment. At the current rate of progress, 670 million people will remain without electricity by 2030 \u2013 10 million more than projected last year.\n\nThe 2022 edition of Tracking SDG 7: The Energy Progress Report shows that the impacts of the pandemic, including lockdowns, disruptions to global supply chains, and diversion of fiscal resources to keep food and fuel prices affordable, have affected the pace of progress toward the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 7) of ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy by 2030. Advances have been impeded particularly in the most vulnerable countries and those already lagging in energy access. Nearly 90 million people in Asia and Africa who had previously gained access to electricity, can no longer afford to pay for their basic energy needs.\n\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on energy have been compounded in the last few months by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has led to uncertainty in global oil and gas markets and has sent energy prices soaring.\n\nAfrica remains the least electrified in the world with 568 million people without electricity access. Sub-Saharan Africa's share of the global population without electricity jumped to 77 percent in 2020 from 71 percent in 2018 whereas most other regions saw declines in their share of the access deficits. While 70 million people globally gained access to clean cooking fuels and technologies, this progress was not enough to keep pace with population growth, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\u201cInternational public financing for renewable energy needs to accelerate, especially in the poorest, most vulnerable countries. We have failed to support those most in need. With only eight years left to achieve universal access to affordable and sustainable energy, we need radical actions to accelerate the increase of international public financial flows and distribute them in a more equitable manner, so 733 million people who are currently left behind can enjoy the benefits of clean energy access.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Francesco La Camera, Director-General of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)\n\nThe report finds that despite continued disruptions in economic activity and supply chains, renewable energy was the only energy source to grow through the pandemic. However, these positive global and regional trends in renewable energy have left behind many countries most in need of electricity. This was aggravated by a decrease in international financial flows for the second year in a row, falling to USD 10.9 billion in 2019.\n\nSDG7 targets also cover energy efficiency. From 2010 to 2019, global annual improvements in energy intensity averaged around 1.9 percent. This is well below the levels needed to meet SDG 7\u2019s targets and to make up for lost ground, the average rate of improvement would have to jump to 3.2 percent.\n\nIn September 2021, the United Nations High-Level Dialogue on Energy brought together governments and stakeholders to accelerate action to achieve a sustainable energy future that leaves no one behind. In this context, the SDG 7 custodian agencies, the International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO), as they launch this report, are urging the international community and policymakers to safeguard gains toward SDG 7; to remain committed to continued action towards affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all; and to maintain a strategic focus on countries needing the most support.\n\nKey highlights on SDG 7 targets\n\nAccess to electricity. The share of the world\u2019s population with access to electricity rose from 83 percent in 2010 to 91 percent in 2020, increasing the number of people with access by 1.3 billion globally. The number without access declined from 1.2 billion people in 2010 to 733 million in 2020. However, the pace of progress in electrification has slowed in recent years which may be explained by the increasing complexity of reaching more remote and poorer unserved populations and the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meeting the 2030 target requires increasing the number of new connections to 100 million a year. At current rates of progress, the world will reach only 92 percent electrification by 2030.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2020, every region of the world showed consistent progress in electrification, but with wide disparities. Electricity access in Sub-Saharan Africa rose from 46 percent in 2018 to 48 percent in 2020, but the region\u2019s share of the global access deficit rose from 71 percent in 2018 to 77 percent in 2020, whereas most other regions, including Central and Southern Asia, saw declines in their share of the access deficits. Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for more than three-quarters of the people (568 million people) who remained without access in 2020.\n\nClean cooking. The share of the global population with access to clean cooking fuels and technologies rose to 69% in 2020, an increase of 3 percentage points over last year. However, population growth outpaced much of the gains in access, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. As a result, the total number of people lacking access to clean cooking has remained relatively stagnant for decades. Between 2000 and 2010, this number was close to three billion people, or one-third of the global population. It dropped to around 2.4 billion in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by advancements in access in large, populous countries in Asia. In contrast, the access deficit in Sub-Saharan Africa has nearly doubled since 1990, reaching a total of around 923 million people in 2020.\n\nA multisectoral, coordinated effort is needed to achieve the SDG 7 target of universal access to clean cooking by 2030. It is critical that the global community learns from the successes and challenges faced by countries that have attempted to design and implement clean household energy policies.\n\nRenewables. Ensuring universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy implies accelerated deployment of renewable energy sources for electricity, heat, and transport. Although there is no quantitative target for SDG 7.2, custodian agencies agree that the share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption (TFEC) needs to rise significantly, even though renewable energy consumption did continue to grow through the pandemic, overcoming disruptions to economic activity and supply chains. While the share of renewable capacity expansion rose by a record amount in 2021, the positive global and regional trajectories mask the fact that countries where new capacity additions lagged were those most in need of increased access. Moreover, rising commodity, energy and shipping prices, as well as restrictive trade measures, have increased the cost of producing and transporting solar photovoltaic (PV) modules, wind turbines, and biofuels, adding uncertainty for future renewable energy projects. Renewable shares need to reach well over 30 percent of TFEC by 2030, up from 18 percent in 2019, to be on track for reaching net-zero energy emissions by 2050. Achieving this objective would require strengthening policy support in all sectors and implementing effective tools to further mobilize private capital, especially in least-developed countries, landlocked developing countries, and small island developing countries.\n\nEnergy efficiency. SDG 7.3 aims to double the global rate of annual improvement in primary energy intensity\u2014the amount of energy used per unit of wealth created\u2014to 2.6 percent in 2010\u201330 versus 1990\u20132010. From 2010 to 2019, global annual improvements in energy intensity averaged around 1.9 percent, well below the target, and the average annual rate of improvement now has to reach 3.2 percent to make up for lost ground. This rate would need to be even higher\u2014consistently over 4 percent for the rest of this decade\u2014if the world is to reach net-zero emissions from the energy sector by 2050, as envisioned in the IEA's Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. Early estimates for 2020 point to a substantial decrease in intensity improvement because of the COVID-19 crisis, as a result of a higher share of energy-intensive activities in the economy and lower energy prices. The outlook for 2021 suggests a return to a 1.9 percent rate of improvement, the average rate during the previous decade, thanks to a sharper focus on energy efficiency policies, particularly in COVID-19 recovery packages. However, energy efficiency policies and investment need to be scaled up significantly to bring the SDG 7.3 target within reach.\n\nInternational Financial Flows. International public financial flows to developing countries in support of clean energy decreased for the second year in a row, falling to USD 10.9 billion in 2019, despite the immense needs for sustainable development in most countries and growing urgency of climate change. The amount was down by nearly 24 per cent from the previous year and may be worsened by the pandemic in 2020. Overall, the level of financing remains below what is needed to reach SDG 7, particularly in the most vulnerable and least developed countries.\n\nThe decrease was seen in most regions, with the only exception in Oceania, where international public flows rose by 72 percent. The bulk of decreases were concentrated in Eastern and South-eastern Asia, where they fell 66.2 percent; Latin America and the Caribbean, where they dropped by 29.8 percent; and Central and Southern Asia, where they declined by 24.5 percent.\n\nAlthough the private sector finances most renewable energy investments, public finance remains key to attract private capital, including for creating an enabling environment for private investments, developing the needed infrastructure, and addressing perceived and real risks and barriers for investments in the energy transition. International public flows to countries that lack the financial resources to support their energy transitions constitute a large part of the international collaboration that will be needed for a global energy transition that would bring the world closer to achieving all SDGs.\n\nIndicators and data for tracking progress. Tracking global progress for SDG 7 targets requires high-quality, reliable and comparable data for informed and effective policymaking at the global, regional, and country levels. The quality of data has been improving through national and international cooperation and solid statistical capacity. National data systems improve as countries establish legal frameworks and institutional arrangements for comprehensive data collection for energy supply and demand balances; implement end-user surveys (e.g., households, businesses, etc.); and develop quality-assurance frameworks. However, after the pandemic hit and disrupted the rate of progress toward Goal 7, more investment in quality statistics is needed to know where we stand and how to get back on track. This is especially important for developing countries, particularly Least Developed Countries, to inform their national energy policies and strategies to ensure no one is left behind.\n\nThis is the eighth edition of this report, formerly known as the Global Tracking Framework (GTF).

        "Tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants in wastewater\n\nAt a Glance A system that combined advanced sample preparation with powerful computer analysis was able to identify individual SARS-CoV-2 variants in wastewater.\n\nUsing wastewater to track the emergence of new variants of concern could be faster and less expensive than clinical testing.\n\nkittirat roekburi / Shutterstock\n\nDuring infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, people shed virus down the drain every time they wash their hands or use the toilet. This can happen whether or not someone has symptoms of the disease.\n\nScientists have been tracking levels of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater as a way to estimate whether infections are rising or falling in communities. Using wastewater to track viral transmission has many potential advantages over clinical testing, which is expensive and requires people to seek out testing.\n\nTo date, it\u2019s been difficult to obtain information about specific variants of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater. RNA, the genetic material of the virus, is easily damaged. It\u2019s also relatively scarce in water samples. This has made it difficult to gather enough high-quality SARS-CoV-2 RNA from wastewater to identify variants rather than just detect the virus in general.\n\nIn a new study, a team of researchers from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and Scripps Research Institute aimed to surmount these limitations. They designed a type of nanobead that binds efficiently to viral RNA in wastewater, allowing more to be captured intact for sequencing.\n\nThe team also developed a computer analysis tool to recognize small, distinct pieces of these sequences. It could rapidly tag different viral variants in the collected samples and estimate their abundance.\n\nThe researchers tested the new monitoring system between November 2020 and September 2021. They examined wastewater gathered daily around the UCSD campus. They also examined daily samples from the primary wastewater treatment plant serving the greater San Diego County. Results from the study, which was funded in part by NIH, were published on July 7, 2022, in Nature.\n\nTrends in the wastewater samples mirrored those from clinical testing over the study period. But the wastewater sampling system detected the Alpha, Delta, and other early variants about two weeks before they started to show up in clinical test samples. The system flagged the presence of the original Omicron variant in San Diego more than a week before it was picked up by clinical sampling in the community. This early detection occurred despite the researchers having less than 3% as many wastewater samples as clinical swabs.\n\nThe wastewater sampling continued to pick up variants in the community weeks after they no longer showed up regularly in clinical testing. It also picked up rare variants that were not found often in the clinic.\n\n\"The coronavirus will continue to spread and evolve, which makes it imperative for public health that we detect new variants early enough to mitigate consequences,\u201d says Dr. Rob Knight from UCSD, one of the study's lead authors.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of places, standard clinical surveillance for new variants of concern is not only slow but extremely cost-prohibitive,\u201d adds Dr. Kristian Andersen from Scripps, who also helped lead the work. \u201cBut with this new tool, you can take one wastewater sample and basically profile the whole city.\u201d\n\n\u2014by Sharon Reynolds",

They just are,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe meaning we give a virus affects how we live with it.\u201d When we describe viruses as enemies and illness as a war, it \u201cassumes the necessity of casualties.\u201d He argues instead to focus resources on caring for one another.\n\nBorn in the early 1980s, Osmundson, a gay man, is acutely aware of the messages that come with viruses. \u201cOur generation of gay men came after the plague,\u201d he writes. \u201cHIV didn\u2019t just kill bodies. It killed a type of sex as well, a type of pleasure.\u201d But new therapies have saved lives and altered perceptions. Pre-exposure prophylaxis can prevent infection, while treatment can render HIV untransmissible (SN: 11/15/19). These advances changed our relationship with the virus, Osmundson writes. \u201cI used to think that HIV would make it harder to find love and sex. Now we know that HIV-positive and undetectable is safe. It\u2019s sexy.\u201d\n\nBut the biomedicine that can change our relationship with viruses has not been wielded equitably, Osmundson observes. He returns throughout the book to our common humanity. \u201cThat fact of all our bodies, vulnerable together, necessitates mutual care.\u201d\n\nBuy Virology from Bookshop.org.

        "After two years of successfully evading getting COVID-19 \u2014 including a few brushes with close contacts, a couple of are-they-just-colds? scares and lots of negative tests \u2014 I recently tested positive.\n\nIt felt both inevitable and shocking. I somehow avoided testing positive during the omicron surge that infected most of my friends this winter, so I figured that either I was invincible or I was next. Staring at my at-home rapid antigen test, I had to acknowledge that the long game of high-stakes tag was finally over. I was now \u201cit.\u201d\n\nCOVID-19 snuck up on me when I least expected it. Cases are low where I live in Queens, N.Y. And riding the subway felt low risk thanks to the federal public transit mask mandate. (A federal judge struck down the mandate on April 18, although the Biden administration announced April 20 it would appeal the ruling and some places, including New York City, are keeping masking requirements in place for the time being.) I had dined indoors, but I still wore my mask inside public spaces (SN: 3/25/22). So when I woke up with a sore throat on a Wednesday, I chalked it up to needing more sleep. Before I tested Friday evening, I was still convinced it was just another cold.\n\nTwo thick lines on my rapid test said otherwise (SN: 12/17/21). OK, I thought, I definitely have COVID. Now what?\n\nThese are my results the day I tested positive for COVID-19. I took two rapid at-home tests just to be extra sure \u2014 and then got a PCR test from a testing site so my results could be included in official case counts. A. Gibbs\n\nI had a pretty good idea of the first few steps, which had been drilled into my head ad nauseam: Isolate immediately. Text close contacts from the 48 hours before first symptoms. Stay away from other people and pets in the house.\n\nIt got blurrier from there. Since I tested myself at home, my COVID-19 test wasn\u2019t official. Surely I should report my positive test; after all, public health regulations are often based on case numbers. But it turns out that playing my part was a lot harder than I would have thought.\n\nWhen it comes to reporting at-home tests, \u201cthere is no formal recommendation,\u201d says Autumn Gertz, an epidemiologist at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital who works on COVID-19 surveillance. Without a federal program for reporting at-home tests, states are left to their own devices, and it\u2019s confusing to make sense of where to report, which means that many people won\u2019t.\n\nThat\u2019s problematic: Now that at-home tests are free and easy to access, at-home testing is becoming increasingly common. Gertz and colleagues are tracking at-home testing trends and say they have noticed a gradual increase in their use to detect COVID-19. In the coming weeks, Gertz says they expect 50 percent of people who get COVID-19 to find out from an at-home test.\n\nCases being underreported is nothing new. Even early on, asymptomatic and mild cases where the person never got tested wouldn\u2019t make the case count. But at-home testing will make underreporting even more prevalent. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation\u2019s data show that only an estimated 7 percent of all U.S. COVID-19 cases are being reported, Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist at the University of Texas in Dallas who writes the Your Local Epidemiologist newsletter, reports April 13 in a post titled \u201cCan we trust case numbers?\u201d\n\nTo make my case count, I donned two KN95 masks and walked to the COVID-19 testing booth on my street to get a PCR test that would be officially reported. (An official PCR test result may also be necessary for insurance coverage in cases that require medical care.) The downside is that I was contagious so there was a risk of exposing others to the virus, though I was masked for all but the swab. An alternative, Gertz suggests, is reporting your positive at-home test to a primary care provider. Some at-home test manufacturers also provide information about how to report results from that test.\n\nBut until public health reporting catches up with the quick transition to at-home testing, we\u2019re flying blind. There are ways to find clues about what\u2019s going on in your community, though.\n\nFor starters, become familiar with your local public health department website, says epidemiologist Michael Mina, the chief science officer at eMed, a company developing a system for at-home test reporting. Check to see if your community monitors wastewater, which is a better way to track the amount of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in communities than case numbers or hospitalizations. Outbreaks Near Me, a project Gertz works on, also collects results from volunteers to help track COVID-19 trends down to the local level.\n\nSign Up For the Latest from Science News Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Client key* E-mail Address* Go Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up.\n\nIn general, \u201cbe aware, and try to keep your eyes open for signals,\u201d Mina says. That includes not discounting anecdotes: \u201cIf you start to hear, like, \u2018Hey, you know, I\u2019ve had a bunch of friends who are positive lately,\u2019 that\u2019s probably a really good indicator \u2026 that there\u2019s a lot of COVID happening in our community right now.\u201d And that it\u2019s a good time to start taking extra precautions again.\n\nSpeaking of precautions, according to the isolation guidelines put out by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, I could have returned to the world without a mask on the 10th day after my symptoms started. But I learned from Mina that you can still be contagious after 10 days. So how do I know if I can still infect others?\n\nTurns out it\u2019s a complicated question. There\u2019s no magic number of days in which all people will no longer be contagious. And you can still have symptoms and not be contagious, and vice versa. But rapid at-home tests are a great indicator \u2014 albeit imperfect \u2014 of current contagiousness. (That\u2019s unlike PCR tests, which are extremely sensitive to any remaining virus in your system long after you stop shedding it.)\n\nHow contagious a person is roughly relates to their viral load, or how many virus particles they have in their body. Early research suggested that the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 is at its highest just before or when symptoms emerge and then rapidly declines after onset of symptoms. That data informed the CDC\u2019s decision to cut its isolation recommendation from 10 days to five days.\n\nBut several recent studies suggest that people infected during the recent COVID-19 surge continue to be contagious after five days. A preprint that studied omicron infections in NBA players found that, after five days of symptoms, about half of the players still showed significant viral load. In another preprint, Mina and researchers at the University of Chicago found that 43 percent of rapid tests from 260 vaccinated health care workers were still positive between five and 10 days after their symptoms appeared. Both studies have yet to be peer-reviewed.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t like a small fraction of people who are still positive and infectious at five days,\u201d Mina says. One possible explanation for these observations is that people who are vaccinated or have been previously infected have a quicker immune system response to the virus. So initial symptoms are caused by your immune response, not a high viral load, which comes later. \u201cI would highly, highly, highly recommend people not listen to the five-day-to-exit-isolation recommendation,\u201d Mina says. \u201cThat was based on old data.\u201d\n\nInstead, experts say, the best way to figure out whether you\u2019re contagious after day five is by taking a rapid at-home test, which measures the amount of viral proteins in your system in real time. You can even get a sense of how infectious you are by the intensity of the positive line on your test, and the speed at which it develops. If your positive line appears quickly, chances are you have an extremely high viral load. If it takes most of the allotted test time and the line is faint, there\u2019s likely less virus in your body.\n\nBut because it takes a lot of virus for the tests to turn positive, \u201cyou should assume that you\u2019re infectious\u201d if any line shows up, Mina says. Even after you\u2019ve tested negative (twice, if possible), still avoid high-risk activities, like visiting an elderly relative.\n\nBy my 12th day in, my symptoms were mostly gone but for a lingering cough and a new proclivity for napping. But I was still testing positive on my rapid test, even though the line was much fainter than it used to be.\n\nI wish there was an on-off switch. But, like with most things in this pandemic, it\u2019s a squishy gray area. For all the public health recommendations, personal navigation of this virus comes down to individual everyday decisions. We hold a lot of power, and often, it feels like, not enough knowledge to make such decisions (SN: 6/16/21).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK to be confused about all this,\u201d Mina says. \u201cI think a lot of people feel isolated right now and feel confused by this pandemic.\u201d Even doctors have a hard time keeping up with the nuances and changes, he adds.\n\nAs for me, I finally tested negative 14 days after my symptoms started. Given Mina\u2019s advice on testing negative twice, I\u2019m still going to be careful, but I feel a little safer now.",
        "In the year before the omicron variant began to spread in the United States, an estimated one-third of 18- to 45-year-olds had gotten sick with COVID-19. Just three months later, that figure doubled, and I was among the people who caught the coronavirus for the first time.\n\nI was in the first wave of people who got omicron in December 2021, as I was finishing my fall semester at Cornell University. On the day I received my positive test result, I knew it was coming. I had a sore throat, cough and my whole body ached. For the next several days, I was so tired that I had to sleep for more than half the day while trying to finish my final exams and help report on the outbreak for my college daily newspaper. Days later, after taking every vitamin, supplement and over-the-counter medicine I could get, I tried to get back to my normal routine, starting with a workout on Zoom. I found myself needing to stop every couple of minutes to catch my breath.\n\nTime passed. I began to exhaust the list of YouTube workouts, and I began to feel better, but I never really got to 100 percent. Six months later, my friends and family no longer asked: \u201cDo you feel any better?\u201d In some ways I do. But between feeling much more out of breath every time I go to exercise than I used to or often hitting a wall at 3 p.m., I\u2019ve wondered: Am I among the estimated 1 in 5 people in the United States who have long COVID?\n\nWhat initially seems like a simple question is actually much more complicated than yes or no. There is no biological test \u2014 no swab or blood test \u2014 to say that someone has long COVID. Doctors and public health organizations don\u2019t have a universal definition of the condition.\n\nPutting a name to it\n\nWhile the disease caused by the novel coronavirus was given the name COVID-19 in February 2020, long COVID surfaced a few months later as a hashtag on Twitter when Elisa Perego began using the term in her tweets. The archaeology researcher who has become a long COVID advocate, first fell ill in late winter of 2020 in Lombardy, Italy. Three months later, she relapsed \u2014 her blood oxygen levels began to drop again, and she may have had a small blood clot in her lungs. This was not the same COVID-19 that Perego was seeing on the news.\n\n\u201cFor me, the idea of long COVID was about reframing COVID,\u201d she told me over e-mail because of ongoing symptoms that make it difficult to talk for long periods of time. The term not only gave her experiences a name but began to unite what was a growing group of those who had COVID-19 and couldn\u2019t seem to shake the aftereffects.\n\n\u201cVery prolonged positive tests were being talked about in Italy. A grassroots movement of people who weren\u2019t recovering from COVID was burgeoning on Twitter and other media,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I thought the hashtag and the name long COVID could be a way to link this growing community.\u201d\n\nSince then, other terms have also been used: post-acute sequelae of SARS CoV-2 infection, or PASC, post-acute COVID-19 and post-COVID conditions. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses that last one, writing broadly \u201cpost-COVID conditions are a wide range of new, returning or ongoing health problems that people experience after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.\u201d\n\nThe only clear distinction that health professionals seem to agree on when it comes to long COVID is that it is the emergence or change of symptoms some time after being infected with the coronavirus. But how long after and what those symptoms are aren\u2019t universally agreed upon.\n\nRight now, that may be for the best, experts say.\n\nA broad definition helps people with long COVID recognize that they have it and receive the care they need, says neuroscientist David Putrino at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. It also helps people from historically excluded groups who have long COVID get a proper diagnosis, when they may have otherwise been written off and labeled as psychosomatic.\n\nYet, even with a broad definition, people might not know they have it. While recently recruiting for a long COVID clinical trial, Putrino found that about half of the people that reported they had \u201cfully recovered\u201d failed his screening for post-COVID conditions because they still had lingering symptoms.\n\nMany of these people fall into a similar camp as I do: They are not debilitated but they are \u201cslowed down.\u201d And similar to me, Putrino says, many of them say that they have fully recovered but have one symptom that doesn\u2019t seem to go away \u2014 like having trouble exercising or needing to go to sleep much earlier than they used to or noticing they need an extra cup of coffee in the afternoon.\n\nSign Up For the Latest from Science News Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Client key* E-mail Address* Go Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up.\n\nWhen COVID-19 becomes long COVID\n\nA key question in knowing who has long COVID is defining when acute COVID ends and long COVID begins. And there is disagreement there, too. The CDC starts its clock for long COVID at four weeks post-infection, while the World Health Organization says it\u2019s closer to 12 weeks. The National Institutes of Health, in recruiting for its initiative to study long COVID, defines \u201cpost-acute\u201d as starting 30 days after infection for children but does not define the window for adults.\n\nThere\u2019s risk in making the time too short or too long. Too short, and doctors may include people that are just having a particularly long bout of acute COVID. They are likely to recover regardless of treatment, so including them makes it difficult to determine if a long COVID treatment is effective. For his work, Putrino is firmly in \u201cteam WHO\u201d because he says that there are people that are still dealing with the acute symptoms of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 four weeks in.\n\n\u201cWe do not want to propagate the narrative that a certain percentage of long COVID patients spontaneously recover,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case. I think that the individuals who are sick at four weeks who then go on to recover without doing anything interventional were just individuals who were still sick with COVID and ultimately recovered.\u201d\n\nHowever, if the start point is too far off, it will delay people getting care.\n\nThis is why Perego leans toward the four-week timeframe so that people can seek care sooner. But she says that researchers may want to track changes in a person\u2019s condition over longer periods of time.\n\n\u201cClinically, my hope would be to have support as early as possible. The timing of the disease development might change in different patients,\u201d she says. \u201cThere might be changes into how the disease develops with vaccination and the new variants. But I don\u2019t like the idea of letting people with no in-depth care to wait for the moment they match a specific clinical case definition, which might be an artificial construct and quite delayed.\u201d\n\nIn a lot of ways, defining long COVID is like trying to hit a moving target but better understanding how long COVID changes over time will help researchers \u201cfigure out exactly what it is and maybe what it isn\u2019t,\u201d says Josh Fessel, a senior clinical advisor at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, a part of the National Institutes of Health. Aside from tracking timing, another way to do that is tracking symptoms.\n\nSymptoms of long COVID\n\nI had what all of the experts I talked with see as the most common symptoms \u2014 fatigue and shortness of breath. But others have trouble thinking or concentrating, a pounding heart, joint or muscle aches to name a few (SN: 2/2/22). While this long list of potential symptoms casts as wide a net as possible, it also creates a \u201cdiagnosis of exclusion,\u201d says Emily Pfaff, a clinical informaticist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In order for patients to know they have long COVID, they must first prove that their symptoms don\u2019t have other causes.\n\n\u201cThat is an effort to ensure that we\u2019re not confusing long COVID with other stuff, but what that can do is sort of put patients on this kind of diagnostic odyssey where they\u2019re trying to match up their symptoms and their physicians and providers are trying to match them up with various diseases only to rule those out in order to say \u2018Yes, maybe this is long COVID,\u2019\u201d she says.\n\nWhat makes ruling conditions out and homing in on long COVID difficult is that long COVID has flavors; it doesn\u2019t come with the same symptoms, and it may not be caused by the same thing in everyone who has it. \u201c\u200b\u200bWe envision that long COVID has at least seven different mechanisms,\u201d says Joan Soriano, a medical epidemiologist who helped WHO write its definition of long COVID. \u201cThis is similar to chronic fatigue syndrome or post-intensive care unit syndrome. Accordingly, any definition of long COVID will not be simple.\u201d\n\nA definition of long COVID has to encompass people who may still have virus circulating in their bodies, those who may have had autoimmune issues following infection, still others who have microclots in their blood and maybe people like me with a nagging feeling of not being quite back to normal. As researchers try to understand long COVID, and how to treat it, they will need to differentiate between these different flavors, called endotypes, Putrino says. Different flavors will call for different treatments. Something like an antiviral will probably work only for those people whose long COVID symptoms are caused by viral persistence. A blood thinner wouldn\u2019t work for them but could help those with microclots.\n\nOne thing that could help with grouping the flavors of long COVID and recognizing how symptoms persist in large groups of patients is artificial intelligence, Soriano says. This is the type of work Pfaff, at UNC, is currently doing. She is creating a machine learning algorithm that can look at a patient\u2019s health records and predict if they will have long COVID. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to be 100 percent,\u201d she says. But her algorithm is beginning to be able to accurately predict who will have it, and she is beginning to use it to figure out what flavor they might have.\n\nData, however, can\u2019t operate in a vacuum, she says. Researchers need information from people like me and many others to get a firm grasp on what long COVID is and how to treat it. Merging hospital data with survey data from patients is the only way forward on creating a definition, Pfaff says.\n\nI\u2019m still not sure where I stand with my own case. A couple of weeks ago, I felt sheepish even mentioning that having long COVID was something that was on my mind. Long COVID is not something that really comes up in my everyday conversations, especially as an active 22-year-old. That quickly changed when Putrino, unprompted, described a class of people who just can\u2019t get back to working out, or need an extra cup of coffee to keep up with their pre-COVID pace. This described how I have felt for months to a tee. Putrino, Pfaff and Fessel agreed that I fall into what is generally a pretty large group of people with long COVID, and Fessel told me he wouldn\u2019t bat an eye if I were to apply to enroll in the NIH\u2019s clinical trial.\n\nStill, I struggled to use the term. I haven\u2019t been put out of work as Perego and hundreds of thousands of others have. Despite my aversion to saying I have long COVID because it has disrupted the lives of so many more than it has my own, defining the broad spectrum of experiences it\u2019s led to may be important. Until we have reliable tests for the condition, what matters is people sharing their individual experiences.",

        "Dogs are as reliable as laboratory tests for detecting COVID-19 cases, and may be even better than PCR tests for identifying infected people who don\u2019t have symptoms. A bonus: The canines are cuter and less invasive than a swab up the nose.\n\nIn a study involving sweat samples from 335 people, trained dogs sniffed out 97 percent of the coronavirus cases that had been identified by PCR tests, researchers report June 1 in PLOS One. And the dogs found all 31 COVID-19 cases among 192 people who didn\u2019t have symptoms.\n\nSign Up For the Latest from Science News Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Client key* E-mail Address* Go Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up.\n\nThese findings are evidence that dogs could be effective for mass screening efforts at places such as airports or concerts and may provide friendly alternatives for testing people who balk at nasal swabs, says Dominique Grandjean, a veterinarian at the National School of Veterinary Medicine of Alfort in Maisons-Alfort, France.\n\n\u201cThe dog doesn\u2019t lie,\u201d but there are many ways PCR tests can go wrong, Grandjean says. The canines\u2019 noses also identified more COVID-19 cases than did antigen tests (SN: 12/17/21), similar to many at-home tests, but sometimes mistook another respiratory virus for the coronavirus, Grandjean and colleagues found. What\u2019s more, anecdotal evidence suggests the dogs can pick up asymptomatic cases as much as 48 hours before people test positive by PCR, he says.\n\nIn the study, dogs from French fire stations and from the Ministry of the Interior of the United Arab Emirates were trained in coronavirus detection by rewarding them with toys \u2014 usually tennis balls. \u201cIt\u2019s playtime for them,\u201d Grandjean says. It takes about three to six weeks, depending on the dog\u2019s experience with odor detection, to train a dog to pick out COVID-19 cases from sweat samples.\n\nThe dogs then sniffed cones housing sweat samples collected from human volunteers\u2019 underarms. Swabbing the sweat off the back of people\u2019s necks or giving the woofers a whiff of used face masks worked just as well, Grandjean says.\n\nThose results indicate that odors from multiple body sites can be used for canine screening, says Kenneth Furton, a forensic chemist at Florida International University in Miami who was not involved in the study.\n\nThe results are similar to previous, smaller studies that also found that dogs perform as well as or even better than PCR tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, Furton says. He and colleagues have used dogs at schools, a music festival and in a small trial screening airline employees for coronavirus infections.\n\nOne of the biggest advantages dogs have over other tests is their speed, Furton says. \u201cEven with what we call a rapid test, you\u2019re still going to have to wait tens of minutes or even hours, where the dog in a matter of seconds or even fractions of seconds can make a response.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear exactly what dogs are smelling when they detect COVID-19 or other diseases, says Cynthia Otto, director of the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine\u2019s working dog center, who was not involved in the study. It may not be a single chemical, but rather a pattern of increasing and decreasing levels of certain aromas. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you could create an odor perfume bottle that would be the scent of COVID,\u201d she says.\n\nEven with repeated studies demonstrating dogs\u2019 COVID-detection prowess, some doctors, scientists and government officials have been skeptical of the claims, Grandjean says. He finds the reluctance puzzling, because dogs are already used to sniff out drugs and explosives, and are being tested for detecting other diseases, such as cancer, he says. \u201cEvery time you take a plane, it\u2019s because dogs have been sniffing your luggage [and found] no explosives. So you trust them when you take a plane, but you don\u2019t want to trust them for COVID?\u201d\n\nOne challenge with dogs, says Furton, is that people don\u2019t think of them as high-tech the way electronic sensors are. \u201cBut dogs are one of the highest-tech devices we have. They\u2019re just biological sensors, instead of electronic sensors,\u201d he says.\n\nAnother drawback for dogs is that they take time to train and there currently aren\u2019t even enough dogs trained to detect explosives, let alone diseases, Otto says. And \u201cdogs that work well in that lab setting may not work well in a people setting,\u201d she says. Handlers can also influence the dog\u2019s response and must be able to read the dog well, she says. \u201cWe need more good dogs.\u201d",

There was a problem signing you up.\n\nAstronomers routinely use gravitational waves \u2014 traveling ripples in the fabric of space and time itself, first detected in 2015 \u2014 to watch cataclysmic events that are hard to study with light alone, such as the merging of two black holes (SN: 2/11/16).\n\nBut physicists have also known about a seemingly useless property of gravitational waves: They can change course. Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity says that spacetime gets warped by matter, and any wave passing through these distortions will change course. The upshot is that when something emits gravitational waves, part of the signal comes straight at Earth, but some might arrive later \u2014 like an echo \u2014 after taking longer paths that bend around a star or anything else heavy.\n\nScientists have always thought these later signals, called \u201cgravitational glints,\u201d should be too weak to detect. But physicists Craig Copi and Glenn Starkman of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, took a leap: Working off Einstein\u2019s theory, they calculated how strong the signal would be when waves scatter through the gravitational field inside a star itself.\n\n\u201cThe shocking thing is that you seem to get a much larger result than you would have expected,\u201d Copi says. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re still trying to understand, where that comes from \u2014 whether it\u2019s believable, even, because it just seems too good to be true.\u201d\n\nIf gravitational glints can be so strong, astronomers could possibly use them to trace the insides of stars, the team says. Researchers could even look for massive bodies in space that would otherwise be impossible to detect, like globs of dark matter or lone neutron stars on the other side of the observable universe.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat would be a very exciting probe,\u201d says Maya Fishbach, an astrophysicist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., who was not involved in the study.\n\nThere are still reasons to be cautious, though. If this phenomenon stands up to more detailed scrutiny, Fishbach says, scientists would have to understand it better before they could use it \u2014 and that will probably be difficult.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very hard calculation,\u201d Copi says.\n\nBut similar challenges have been overcome before. \u201cThe whole story of gravitational wave detection has been like that,\u201d Fishbach says. It was a struggle to do all the math needed to understand their measurements, she says, but now the field is taking off (SN: 1/21/21). \u201cThis is the time to really be creative with gravitational waves.\u201d",

In the Caribbean, hospitalizations continue to increase in Cuba, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, and Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nThe PAHO Director highlighted that, as is also the case in Europe, Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 sub-lineages are becoming the predominant strains in the Americas, but with one key difference \u2013 vaccination coverage.\n\nHigh vaccination coverage in Europe means that most COVID-19 patients have been able to safely manage their symptoms at home but in the Americas \u201ca third of the population remains unvaccinated and ten countries and territories have yet to protect even 40% of their populations,\u201d she said.\n\nGiven the increased transmissibility of the new sub-lineages, Dr. Etienne urged countries to implement public health measures, such as social distancing and mask wearing, and advised that hospitals in areas with low vaccination coverage should \u201cbrace themselves\u201d for an influx of COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe PAHO Director said that countries must also prepare for monkeypox, which was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) this weekend.\n\nIn the Americas, numbers have reached almost 5300 across 18 countries and territories.\n\nBut while nearly all cases so far have been reported among men who have sex with men between the ages of 25 and 45, the Director warned against stigma and discrimination, underscoring that \u201canyone, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation, can get monkeypox.\u201d\n\nPAHO continues to work with Member States on COVID-19 response and has also issued guidance for health workers to manage monkeypox cases and prevent further infections.\n\nTurning to the recent case of vaccine-derived polio type 2 case reported in the United States, Dr. Etienne warned that while the Americas has been polio-free since 1994 thanks to good vaccination coverage and surveillance, in recent years polio vaccination rates have dropped considerably.\n\nThe Director said that low vaccination coverage is \u201cextremely worrisome,\u201d putting children at risk of \u201cdevastating diseases that have been eliminated in the region.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to be complacent,\u201d she added, and must use the tools at our disposal to keep our populations healthy.\u201d",

        "Since April 2020, the Pan-American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) has warned of the possibility that countries could face recurrent outbreaks of COVID-19 of different magnitude based on a series of factors, including the proportion of the susceptible population. In recent weeks, there has been an increase in new outpatient cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in some countries/territories in the Region of the Americas, which, along with the increase in hospitalizations due to other causes, could impact the demand for health services. PAHO/WHO urges Member States to strengthen surveillance for respiratory diseases of viral etiology, to update the preparedness and response plans of the healthcare system across all levels in order to respond to a possible increase in outpatient cases, hospitalizations, and/or deaths, as well as to establish strategies for increasing the proportion of the vaccinated, mainly among vulnerable and high-risk populations.",
        "Abstract\n\nThe Director\u2019s 2021 annual report on the work of the Pan American Sanitary Bureau (the Bureau), Regional Office for the Americas of the World Health Organization, highlights the technical cooperation undertaken by the Bureau during the period from July 2020 to June 2021, within the framework of the 2020\u20132025 Strategic Plan of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). The theme of the report is: Working through the COVID-19 Pandemic. The period covered has been the most challenging ever encountered by PAHO. The pandemic, through its devastating health and economic consequences, has severely impacted people\u2019s lives and livelihoods and disrupted countries, societies, economies, and their development. This has occurred in conjunction with the inevitable challenges on the road to equitable, sustainable development and the achievement of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals and the objectives of the Sustainable Health Agenda for the Americas 2018\u20132030. The publication opens with a preface by the Director of PASB, a concise executive summary, and a brief introduction. It then presents a comprehensive review of PAHO\u2019s technical cooperation, and of the Bureau\u2019s institutional and strengthening functions. The report highlights achievements, challenges, and lessons learned as the Bureau undertook technical cooperation with PAHO Member States at national, subregional, and regional levels within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, working with traditional and new partners to find equitable solutions for emerging and persisting health issues in the Region of the Americas. It also looks ahead, analyzing those opportunities brought to light by the COVID-19 experience for strengthening PAHO\u2019s promotion of and contribution to equity and progressive realization of the right to health. Moreover, it indicates how the Bureau, with the concurrence and guidance of Member States, and in collaboration with partners, will take advantage of such opportunities. This report is complemented by the Financial Report of the Director, and the Report of the External Auditor for the year 2020.",
        "In the second part of this two-part conversation, Jeremy Faust, MD, editor-in-chief of MedPage Today, and Paul Offit, MD, discuss the ambiguity of long COVID, the risks of pediatric COVID, and the \"human price to pay for knowledge.\"\n\nOffit is director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), attending physician in the division of infectious diseases at CHOP, and Maurice R. Hilleman Professor of Vaccinology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. He is also a member of the FDA Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. Watch part one of this two-part discussion here.\n\nThe following is a transcript of their remarks:\n\nJeremy Faust, MD: If you're advising my parents, who are in their 70s, should they get their fourth dose right now because they haven't gotten it yet? Or should they wait until the bivalent [vaccine] comes on in the fall because they're trying to avoid infection or anything else? So what should they do? Should they just do it now? Or should they wait?\n\nPaul Offit, MD: First of all, it's really hard to avoid infection. It is. I mean, these are highly contagious viruses; they're immune evasive. It's a short incubation-period mucosal respiratory infection, so at some level, we're going to have to try and find a way to accept mild infection. Even for those who are at highest risk, what are we going to do? Boost twice a year? It is just not a practical strategy, I think.\n\nIn answer to your question, I guess I would wait and see what the data show. Hopefully we'll have much more vigorous data regarding this sort of bivalent vaccine that contains BA5 because it looks like that's the way the [Biden] administration wants to go. We'll have clear data on that, and if that's true, then I would wait because I really do think people make a mistake when they give boosters very close together. You really should wait several months to do that. I disagree with the people who occasionally say, 'Well, get it now and then you can get it again later.' No, let's wait; wait until later to see what this BA5 looks like.\n\nFaust: Alright, let's talk about vaccines and long COVID. We know that we know nothing, but there's certainly a concern that this virus, this pandemic, is sort of a mass event for creating disability. Even if there's a range of estimates on how much long COVID there is, and even if the lowest estimates are true, it's still a ton of people. Do you think we're going to get a readout on whether vaccines and boosts in particular help otherwise healthy people avoid long COVID, or is that just going to be impossible to sort out?\n\nOffit: Well, you said it, we need to define this phenomenon of long COVID. Right now, you read estimates that range anywhere from 5% of people who suffer natural infection up to 50% of people. For example, the United States has a higher rate of long COVID than Europe does, so we have a definition problem. We clearly need to define it as objectively as possible because it's a real entity, and the part of it that worries me is the vasculitis part. I mean, this is a virus that can cause you to make an immune response to your own endothelial cells that line blood vessels, so therefore all organs are at risk.\n\nYou do need to have a defined way of doing this because now if you look at these meta-analyses, the symptom that seems to come up to the top most frequently is fatigue, which is hard to define. Fatigue, pain, those are whatever you say they are. It's not like measuring your blood pressure or temperature. It's not so easily defined, so define it! Find a much clearer way of defining it than saying, 'Are you tired when you get up in the morning? Have you been tired for weeks?' because it sets itself up for just including far more people.\n\nI feel sorry now for employers and for insurance companies that are now going to try and figure out how to deal with the massive amount of disability that no doubt is going to follow this virus. We need to define it immunologically, virologically, and at some level, psychologically. We have to do that. We have to because it's going to be a big hit associated with this diagnosis.\n\nFaust: Long COVID is obviously a concern across the age spectrum, but a lot of young people are worried about it. But there's a group of people that are really maybe relatively low risk, but really of our concern and is an area of great interest in your career, and this is pediatrics; in kids. What's your stance on pediatric vaccines? And how do you respond to the idea that COVID either isn't that bad for kids and they don't need a vaccine, or maybe even if it is on a population level, too many have been exposed anyway so why do it? Where are we on pediatric COVID vaccines?\n\nOffit: Right. Well, we all have our biases. I guess mine is that I work at a children's hospital, so I do see children come into our hospital who suffer this disease.\n\nIf you look sort of just at the data that we were presented at the FDA vaccine advisory committee when we made this decision in mid-June about vaccines for less than 5-year-olds, it is clear that there are at least millions of children who've been infected who are less than 5 years of age. It's also clear that at least children have been hospitalized -- and if you look at the CDC data, thousands and thousands have been hospitalized, and according to CDC data, about 200 have died from this virus.\n\nNow, you want to make sure you have good data there. Is it that they're getting hospitalized or dying with this virus or from this virus? We need to make that very clear, and I think that's a little less clear. I can certainly say that we see children who come into our hospital because they have COVID or are treated because they have COVID; some of whom end up in the intensive care unit. It's real, and for that reason it should be prevented.\n\nSo then the question becomes when is the best time to vaccinate, I think. Because if you make the assumption that the virus can cause death at any age -- which is true -- if you make the assumption that this virus is going to be with us for years, if not decades, which I think is also true, then the question is: When to vaccinate? Because every year in this country 3.5 to more than 4 million children are brought into this world who are fully susceptible to this virus, and this virus is going to be around for a long time. We are going to need to have a high level of population immunity to protect them. So [the question] when to vaccinate, is what I would argue.\n\nNow, in the worst case scenario, it may be that if you find that memory responses, which were associated generally with protection against severe disease, fade after 5 years or 10 years and you need to re-vaccinate later, fine. But at least you've protected them during that period of time.\n\nFaust: Can I ask you for a clinical impression? I'll set it up by sharing a little bit of mine. In early 2020, COVID pneumonia was on every x-ray. They come in and it's like, 'Wow, this is a crazy x-ray. Why do I keep seeing this thing?'\n\nAnd then in the Delta/Omicron period, where you had a lot of people coming into the hospital even though they were vaccinated, that group didn't have COVID pneumonia. They were being hospitalized for emphysema, but COVID exacerbated it so it's COVID's fault, but it's not COVID pneumonia.\n\nWhat do you see in kids who are unvaccinated who get hospitalized? Are they having that COVID pneumonia like I was seeing in early 2020, or is it a kid who's dehydrated who just can't go home?\n\nOffit: No. I was on service a few weeks ago and we saw an unvaccinated adolescent who came in, who clearly had COVID pneumonia. I mean, he was sick. He required supplemental oxygen; his oxygen saturation levels were low. If you looked at his x-ray and his CT scan, it was striking and clearly COVID pneumonia.\n\nFaust: And what do you say to people who were out there saying, 'Look, this is so rare [in kids]. We don't need to make kids have to get vaccinated. They don't have hypoxia.' You know, the downplayers, how do you reach them? What do you say to them?\n\nOffit: It's not rare enough. I think if this was like rhinovirus, and it's basically a common cold virus, and it's not the kind of thing that's going to cause you to be hospitalized or go to the ICU or die, fine. But it's not that virus; this virus is much scarier.\n\nThe scariest aspect to me is this MIS-C, this multisystem inflammatory disease in children, which is striking. You have a child, typically between 5 and 13 years of age -- an average 9 years of age -- who comes in and usually has a fairly trivial infection that was picked up serendipitously because they were exposed to a friend or family member. A month later, they come back; they're not shedding virus, they're antigen negative; PCR negative, but they have high fever, they have evidence of pulmonary disease, kidney disease, heart disease, liver disease. It is a frightening illness and they will occasionally die. That is a post-infectious inflammatory disease that is caused by a respiratory virus, and I haven't seen anything like that before. That to me is the most compelling reason to get vaccinated, actually, because it's just so different from what you normally see.\n\nBut, you know, this virus can cause severe illness. Yes, it's relatively rare, but it certainly compares to the other viruses for which we have vaccines. I mean, if you're willing to get a polio vaccine or a flu vaccine or a chickenpox vaccine or measles vaccine, this virus compares to those in terms of how likely it is to kill you.\n\nFaust: We're running out of time, but I can't resist, why is it that MIS-C, this multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, seems to have gone down in incidents in the Delta and Omicron period? This is a tremendous relief, but why do we think that happened?\n\nOffit: It has. I mean, I think it was the data out of South Africa regarding Omicron and subvariants that [said] that MIS-C is definitely less common. You would have to argue that the price that the virus is paying to be more contagious, which is to say the mutations that are associated with immune evasiveness, are also associated with a lesser virulence...\n\nFaust: Which favors spread of the virus, actually.\n\nOffit: Right, In theory, if you anthropomorphize the virus, it's never to the virus' advantage to kill you. I mean, if it wants to live, and presumably it does, then it's easier to spread from person to person if you're not dead.\n\nFaust: Right. At the extremes, the symptomatology has some impact on the reproductive number, but only at the extremes. Other than that, a little bit more virulent, a little bit less; it doesn't matter.\n\nI think you are the perfect person to ask this, what I think will be my final question: That is that whenever we are looking at a therapeutic or a vaccine or any intervention in a pandemic environment, you have to balance the need to act with incomplete information in an emergency setting versus waiting until you have enough data that says this is a safe, effective, and even cost-effective approach. How do you balance that?\n\nI sense that your balance is a little bit more towards the second one when you sense it is safe to wait, but how do you tell people to make that balance? Because most people are saying, 'Oh, we've got to act. We've got to act, forget it, no time for data.'\n\nOffit: Right. Good question. We on the FDA vaccine advisory committee have continued to face that ever since December of 2020, especially for the childhood vaccines; for the vaccine for less than 5-year-olds. Because the question is never 'When do you know everything?,' because you never know everything. The question is, 'When do you know enough?' When do you cross that line where you feel comfortable that you know enough [while] knowing there's always a human price to pay for knowledge.\n\nI mean, if you go back to December 2020, there was a death in that placebo group associated with that. I give a lot of credit to these parents who volunteer for these trials knowing their child may be injected with a placebo, knowing that their child may suffer the disease because of that decision. And it's the same for us, because the decision not to get a vaccine is not a risk-free choice. It's just a choice to take a different risk. Our goal is to try and figure out how to advise parents or others to take the lesser risk.\n\nI'll just add one story because I'm an old person, as you can see since this is a video. I'm a child of the fifties. If you look at the polio vaccine story. So we always hail Jonas Salk, rightfully, as a critical researcher in the development of the polio vaccine. Well, when we did that trial -- when Thomas Francis ran that so-called Francis Field Trial of the polio vaccine between 1954 and 1955 -- you had 1.2 million children who were vaccinated, ultimately. It was about 400,000 children that were vaccinated with the inactivated vaccine, 200,000 received the placebo shot, and you had another 1.2 million children who were observed on inactivated controls. It was like a 1.8-million child study; a huge study.\n\nJonas Salk didn't want to do that study. He didn't. He felt he'd vaccinated 700 children in the Pittsburgh area, he thought that the immune response was excellent, it was an inactivated vaccine, he could not imagine that anyone should ever do a trial with a placebo. He couldn't conscience that trial.\n\nThe 1.2 million children who were observed uninoculated were really a nod to him. He did not want to inoculate children with placebo in the mid-1950s, knowing that every year 20,000 to 30,000 children suffered paralysis, and about 1,500 children died of polio.\n\nSo when Thomas Francis gets up and he makes the announcement that the vaccine was safe, potent, and effective -- three words that appeared on the headline of every newspaper in this country -- how did he know it was effective? He knew it was effective because 16 children died of polio in that study, all in the placebo group. He knew it was effective because there were 36 children who were paralyzed in that study, 34 in the placebo group.\n\nThose were first and second graders in the 1950s; I was a first and second grader in the 1950s. Those children could have lived long, productive lives but for the flip of a coin. There is always a human price to pay for knowledge, and that's the hardest part of all of this.\n\nFaust: And yet if they don't do that study, or they don't do the study today, how many people will die or have bad outcomes because they say, 'Well, I'm not going to do it just because some fancy doctor said it works'? People will be convinced, ultimately, by a combination of education through their pediatricians or through the press, or even through experience where they say, 'Look, every kid I know who had this bad outcome didn't have a vaccine.' Eventually, the anecdotal evidence kind of piles up in a way that's meaningful. Is that fair?\n\nOffit: I mean, you're certainly right. You don't convince people without doing those kinds of studies. And in fact, if you look at these two mRNA vaccines, as big as those studies were that were presented back in December 2020 -- 40,000 for Pfizer and 30,000 for Moderna, those are the size of any typical pediatric or adult vaccine trial -- still, we didn't know about myocarditis or pericarditis as a consequence of that vaccine. You knew that only when millions of children were vaccinated.\n\nMaurice Hilleman, who I consider to be the father of modern vaccines in many ways because he did the primary research development on nine of the 14 vaccines that we give children, said it best. He said, 'I never breathe a sigh of relief until the first 3 million doses are out there.\" But that's never going to be done pre-licensure or preapproval. So that's how you learn.\n\nMedical innovation invariably comes with a human cost either way, either because you do get the vaccine or because you don't get the vaccine.\n\nFaust: Dr. Paul Offit, thank you so much for joining us. Your analysis has been almost singular in the public conversation in terms of balancing what I would call an exceedingly pro-vaccine stance while insisting on excellent science so that we eventually reach the most people. So thank you for doing that and for joining us here today.\n\nOffit: My pleasure. Thank you.\n\nEmily Hutto is an Associate Video Producer & Editor for MedPage Today.

        "A substantial proportion of COVID-19 patients who continue to test positive on a rapid antigen test after 5 days may still be infectious, according to a small study.\n\nOf 17 patients who were tested for viral culture on day 6, 12 still had a positive antigen test, and six of these patients had culturable virus, a proxy for infectiousness, reported Lisa Cosimi, MD, of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, and colleagues in JAMA Network Open.\n\nThese findings could have implications for current CDC guidelines that recommend ending isolation after 5 days if afebrile for 24 hours and symptoms are improving.\n\nCosimi said rapid antigen tests (RATs) correlate well with viral culture in the first several days of infection, so one might have expected the percentage of culturable samples to be higher. However, she noted, these tests haven't been validated for use in the later phases of infection, such as after day 5.\n\nWhile previous studies have correlated antigen test positivity with culture positivity during early infection, there aren't much data on test positivity and culturable virus more than 5 days after infection, even though people can test positive for far longer.\n\n\"It's plausible that, similar to PCR testing, RATs are detecting viral shedding that is not actually capable of transmission,\" Cosimi told MedPage Today in an email. \"Therefore, maintaining isolation through day 10 may unduly isolate a large number of individuals who are not still infectious.\"\n\n\"However, given these data, there is also a risk that individuals are leaving isolation while still infectious,\" she added. \"We strongly agree with CDC's recommendation to wear a tight-fitting mask on days 6-10, especially if RAT positive, and to avoid areas where there is a high risk of transmission to others.\"\n\nCosimi and colleagues enrolled 40 people with COVID-19 (mean age 34) from January 5 to February 11, when Omicron BA.1 was the predominant strain in the Boston area. The majority of the participants (75%) had a positive rapid antigen test on day 6; only 10 participants had a negative test on day 6.\n\nThe researchers focused on a convenience sample of 17 individuals, collecting anterior nasal and oral swabs on day 6 to grow in culture, as culturable virus is currently the best proxy for transmissibility.\n\nOf the six people who had culturable virus, two had improving symptoms, two had unchanged symptoms, and two never reported any symptoms.\n\nNone of the five people with a negative rapid antigen test on day 6 had positive cultures. In addition, seven of the nine people who had no symptoms on day 6 had negative culture results.\n\nAll patients in the study were negative by day 14, and the mean day of first negative rapid antigen test was 9.3 in those who'd ever had symptoms and 8.1 in those who'd never had symptoms.\n\nCosimi pointed to two other small studies that found culturable virus after day 5. One study found that 17% of vaccinated college students had culturable virus after day 5 from symptom onset, with the latest on day 12. Another found the median time to culture conversion to negative was 6 days after an initial diagnosis with a PCR test.\n\nThe researchers concluded that the data \"suggest that a negative RAT result in individuals with residual symptoms could provide reassurance about ending isolation. However, a universal requirement of a negative RAT result may unduly extend isolation for those who are no longer infectious. Meanwhile, a recommendation to end isolation based solely on the presence of improving symptoms risks releasing culture-positive, potentially infectious individuals prematurely, underscoring the importance of proper mask wearing and avoidance of high-risk transmission venues through day 10.\"\n\nThe study was limited by its small cohort of mostly young, vaccinated, and non-hospitalized patients, and thus may not be generalizable to a wider population.\n\nKristina Fiore leads MedPage\u2019s enterprise & investigative reporting team.

        "Persistent smell loss after SARS-CoV-2 infection predicted cognitive impairment in older adults, a longitudinal study in Argentina showed.\n\nOne year after acute infection, anosmia was more strongly associated with cognitive impairment than severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, reported Gabriela Gonzalez-Aleman, MSc, PhD, of Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Argentina in Buenos Aires, at the 2022 Alzheimer's Association International Conference.\n\n\"The more insight we have into what causes or at least predicts who will experience the significant long-term cognitive impact of COVID-19 infection, the better we can track it and begin to develop methods to prevent it,\" Gonzalez-Aleman said.\n\nThe findings are part of a global brain study of chronic neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID, a consortium of researchers led by the Alzheimer's Association and representatives from more than 25 countries with technical guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n\"We're learning more every day about the link between COVID-19 and the brain,\" noted Claire Sexton, PhD, senior director of scientific programs and outreach at the Alzheimer's Association. \"Loss of smell is often a signal of an inflammatory response in the brain. We know inflammation is part of the neurodegenerative process in diseases like Alzheimer's.\"\n\n\"With other viruses, such as SARS and MERS, there have been similar associations between infection and cognition, but there are still big questions about cause and effect,\" Sexton pointed out.\n\nThe Argentina study followed 865 people over age 60 recruited from a provincial health registry that included all SARS-CoV-2 testing data for the region. Researchers randomly invited older adults with a positive PCR COVID test to participate between 3 and 6 months after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nAssessments followed the recommendations of the global consortium and included the WHO Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) scale, the Clinical Dementia Rating scale, neurocognitive and emotional reactivity assessments, and evaluations of semi-quantitative olfactory function, motor function, coordination, and gait.\n\nAmong the 865 participants, 84.2% had COVID and 15.8% were controls with no history of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Median age was 67 and just more than half (56.5%) were female. Participants had a median of 10.35 years of education. Most participants with COVID did not have severe infection, with very few (2% or less) admitted to the ICU.\n\nAt 1 year, about one-fourth of the study sample had no cognitive impairment; this group included control participants and about 20% of post-COVID patients, Gonzalez-Aleman said. Scores of remaining participants were normalized to the mean of the cognitively normal group, with impairment defined as z-scores below -2. Remaining participants were clustered into groups based on deficits in memory, attention, executive function, and language, with some people showing impairment in multiple domains.\n\nPCR status and age predicted post-COVID cognitive problems, Gonzalez-Aleman said. Logistic regression analyses showed severity of anosmia, but not severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, was significantly associated with cognitive impairment.\n\nAll anosmia was reported after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, Gonzalez-Aleman noted. Some people in the control group also had anosmia, but their olfactory dysfunction was much less frequent -- and less severe -- than that of participants with COVID, she added.\n\nThe results are part of ongoing research about COVID among older Amerindian adults in Argentina. \"It's important to provide the most up-to-date research to the public so we can be aware of the evolving ways this virus impacts us,\" Sexton said.\n\n\"But it's also worth stressing that much more research is needed to paint a more complete picture of what COVID-19 is doing to our bodies and brains,\" she added. \"We also need to study the direct impact that 2 years of pandemic-related isolation has had on our health.\"\n\nJudy George covers neurology and neuroscience news for MedPage Today, writing about brain aging, Alzheimer\u2019s, dementia, MS, rare diseases, epilepsy, autism, headache, stroke, Parkinson\u2019s, ALS, concussion, CTE, sleep, pain, and more.

And if you like what you hear, a five-star rating goes a long way in helping us spread the word!\n\nThank you for joining us here on Anamnesis, a medical storytelling podcast from MedPage Today. My name is Shannon Firth. I'm a reporter with MedPage and I'll be your host for this episode.\n\nFor those of you who listen in regularly, this month's episode will be a little different. Instead of three stories from individual clinicians on a theme, we're bringing you just one story. An important story focused on the underreported, sometimes overlooked, challenges for nurses who struggle with substance use.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the public romanticized the role of nurses, casting them as superheroes -- women and men who sacrificed everything for their patients. But for many, the grief, stress, and exhaustion took a toll. In one survey, nearly half of critical care nurses said they felt depressed, and a third said they were drinking more. Six percent said they felt suicidal.\n\nAnd that's where the story of Tiffany Swedeen comes in.\n\nOver the holidays, a nurse in recovery from opioid use disorder struggled to keep her addiction in check. She was caring for coronavirus patients on the front lines in an ICU outside Seattle. She asked her hospital for more support, and received little. She reached out to her family, but that just made things worse. On Sunday, January 3, 2021, Tiffany Swedeen relapsed.\n\nTiffany's story highlights the fact that when it comes to substance use disorders, our healthcare system has one standard for patients and another for nurses. And while nurses have responsibilities not only to themselves, but to the public, it's worth remembering that substance use disorder is still a chronic but treatable brain disease, and not a moral failing.\n\nThis episode of Anamnesis features discussions of drug abuse and suicide that may be disturbing to some listeners. Discretion is advised.\n\nChapter 1. Blacked Out on Fentanyl for a Day (2:40) -- A nurse in recovery shares one of her loneliest moments.\n\nChapter 2.

        "A wide range of symptoms and conditions cropped up in children and adolescents in the year after a COVID-19 infection, though they were seemingly spared from mental and breathing issues, a CDC study reported.\n\nCompared with peers not diagnosed with COVID-19, young people ages 0-17 years with laboratory-confirmed illness were significantly more likely to develop the following conditions within 31-365 days of diagnosis:\n\nAcute pulmonary embolism (adjusted HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.62-2.50)\n\nMyocarditis and cardiomyopathy (adjusted HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.81-2.19)\n\nVenous thromboembolic events (adjusted HR 1.87, 95% CI 1.54-2.26)\n\nAcute and unspecified renal failure (adjusted HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.22-1.43)\n\nType 1 diabetes (adjusted HR 1.23, 1.13-1.33)\n\nAlso linked to COVID-19 were persistent cardiac arrhythmias, bleeding disorders, smell and taste disturbances, and malaise and fatigue.\n\nNevertheless, the incidence of these conditions remained uncommon in the post-COVID pediatric population, according to Lyudmyla Kompaniyets, PhD, health economist at the CDC in Atlanta, and colleagues reporting in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.\n\nStudy authors said their finding of elevated diabetes and myocarditis among children months after COVID is consistent with previous evidence, whereas the other observed risks appear to be novel in this population.\n\nNotably, the COVID patients had low rates of respiratory, mental health, neurological, muscle disorders, and sleeping disorders compared with the general population in this study.\n\n\"Reasons for these observed associations are likely multifactorial, and might be, in part, because patients without COVID-19 were selected from a cohort of patients with a health care encounter possibly related to COVID-19 and were less healthy than were patients with COVID-19 at baseline,\" the CDC group suggested.\n\nThe definition of post-COVID symptoms and conditions used by the authors was new, recurring, or ongoing health problems that occurred 4 or more weeks after infection with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe study was conducted using large medical claims databases in order to assess nine potential post-COVID signs and symptoms and 15 potential post-COVID conditions among children and adolescents.\n\nData were collected on 781,419 U.S. children and adolescents with COVID-19, who were matched 1:3 with peers with a healthcare encounter but no reported COVID-19 from March 2021 to January 2022. Participants were followed for a minimum of 60 days and a maximum of 365 days.\n\nThe cohort had a mean age of 12 years, and was evenly split between boys and girls.\n\nStatistical models were adjusted for age, sex, race, U.S. Census Bureau region, payor type, previous medical complexity, and previous hospitalization.\n\nKompaniyets and colleagues warned that their analysis of post-COVID symptoms and conditions was subject to misclassification bias and did not account for events that started before COVID infection. Whether the reported conditions were transient or chronic was not known.\n\nThere is also the possibility that some children may have had undocumented COVID-19, they acknowledged, adding that the 70% rate of patients being on Medicaid managed care limits the study's generalizability to all children and adolescents.\n\nFinally, vaccination status was not adjusted for in the study because of assumed underreporting in the dataset. Nonetheless, the CDC group maintained the importance of COVID vaccination in children and teenagers.\n\n\"COVID-19 prevention strategies, including vaccination for all eligible persons aged \u22656 months, are critical for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent illness and for reducing the public health impact of post-COVID symptoms and conditions,\" they wrote.\n\nJames Lopilato is a staff writer for Medpage Today.

        "A substantial proportion of COVID-19 patients who continue to test positive on a rapid antigen test after 5 days may still be infectious, according to a small study.\n\nOf 17 patients who were tested for viral culture on day 6, 12 still had a positive antigen test, and six of these patients had culturable virus, a proxy for infectiousness, reported Lisa Cosimi, MD, of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, and colleagues in JAMA Network Open.\n\nThese findings could have implications for current CDC guidelines that recommend ending isolation after 5 days if afebrile for 24 hours and symptoms are improving.\n\nCosimi said rapid antigen tests (RATs) correlate well with viral culture in the first several days of infection, so one might have expected the percentage of culturable samples to be higher. However, she noted, these tests haven't been validated for use in the later phases of infection, such as after day 5.\n\nWhile previous studies have correlated antigen test positivity with culture positivity during early infection, there aren't much data on test positivity and culturable virus more than 5 days after infection, even though people can test positive for far longer.\n\n\"It's plausible that, similar to PCR testing, RATs are detecting viral shedding that is not actually capable of transmission,\" Cosimi told MedPage Today in an email. \"Therefore, maintaining isolation through day 10 may unduly isolate a large number of individuals who are not still infectious.\"\n\n\"However, given these data, there is also a risk that individuals are leaving isolation while still infectious,\" she added. \"We strongly agree with CDC's recommendation to wear a tight-fitting mask on days 6-10, especially if RAT positive, and to avoid areas where there is a high risk of transmission to others.\"\n\nCosimi and colleagues enrolled 40 people with COVID-19 (mean age 34) from January 5 to February 11, when Omicron BA.1 was the predominant strain in the Boston area. The majority of the participants (75%) had a positive rapid antigen test on day 6; only 10 participants had a negative test on day 6.\n\nThe researchers focused on a convenience sample of 17 individuals, collecting anterior nasal and oral swabs on day 6 to grow in culture, as culturable virus is currently the best proxy for transmissibility.\n\nOf the six people who had culturable virus, two had improving symptoms, two had unchanged symptoms, and two never reported any symptoms.\n\nNone of the five people with a negative rapid antigen test on day 6 had positive cultures. In addition, seven of the nine people who had no symptoms on day 6 had negative culture results.\n\nAll patients in the study were negative by day 14, and the mean day of first negative rapid antigen test was 9.3 in those who'd ever had symptoms and 8.1 in those who'd never had symptoms.\n\nCosimi pointed to two other small studies that found culturable virus after day 5. One study found that 17% of vaccinated college students had culturable virus after day 5 from symptom onset, with the latest on day 12. Another found the median time to culture conversion to negative was 6 days after an initial diagnosis with a PCR test.\n\nThe researchers concluded that the data \"suggest that a negative RAT result in individuals with residual symptoms could provide reassurance about ending isolation. However, a universal requirement of a negative RAT result may unduly extend isolation for those who are no longer infectious. Meanwhile, a recommendation to end isolation based solely on the presence of improving symptoms risks releasing culture-positive, potentially infectious individuals prematurely, underscoring the importance of proper mask wearing and avoidance of high-risk transmission venues through day 10.\"\n\nThe study was limited by its small cohort of mostly young, vaccinated, and non-hospitalized patients, and thus may not be generalizable to a wider population.\n\nKristina Fiore leads MedPage\u2019s enterprise & investigative reporting team.

        "In the first part of this two-part conversation, Jeremy Faust, MD, editor-in-chief of MedPage Today, talks with Paul Offit, MD, about his recent decision to vote against the bivalent COVID-19 booster shot at a recent meeting of FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC).\n\nOffit is director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), attending physician in the division of infectious diseases at CHOP, and Maurice R. Hilleman Professor of Vaccinology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe following is a transcript of their remarks:\n\nJeremy Faust, MD: Hello, I'm Jeremy Faust, medical editor-in-chief of MedPage Today. Thanks for joining us.\n\nToday we are joined by Dr. Paul Offit. He is a member of the FDA Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, the VRBPAC, which is the committee that publicly discusses, and debates, and ultimately votes on recommendations related to the COVID-19 vaccines and their authorization for use.\n\nDr. Paul Offit, thank you so much for joining us.\n\nPaul Offit, MD: My pleasure.\n\nFaust: Let's start by talking about an article you wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine, 'COVID-19 boosters -- where from here?' You argued, essentially, that these mRNA vaccines in particular were designed to do something very specific, which is to prevent severe disease and deaths, and that they happen to temporarily do what everyone else wants them to do, which is to decrease infections.\n\nIt seems to me that a lot of people are looking at boosters and they don't realize it, but they're treating them like they're almost prophylaxis, and I think that, in your view, is not a sustainable way to do things. How do you think this is going to play out?\n\nOffit: I think probably you can trace the confusion back to December of 2020.\n\nIn December of 2020, the FDA vaccine advisory committee was asked to consider both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Those were two-dose vaccines given 3 or 4 weeks apart, and protection against mild, moderate, and severe disease was 95%. Those vaccines were roughly 95% effective at preventing not only severe illness, but also mild illness.\n\nThen what happened was 6 months later, the CDC did studies showing that protection against severe disease holding up, which is good, but the protection against mild disease was fading -- as you would've guessed -- because protection against mild diseases, for the most part, is mediated by neutralizing antibodies present at the time of infection, and those faded.\n\nSo why was it 95% protection against mild disease in December of 2020? Those were 3-month studies. Those participants had just gotten their second dose. So therefore, you sort of had this unrealistic sense of what this was all about. That was the way it was handled, not only by the media, but I think in many ways by public health officials; officials who use words like 'fading immunity' or 'breakthrough infections' when you were seeing exactly what you would expect to see.\n\nEven 1 year later, when studies were done by Mark Tenforde out of the CDC, with just two doses you found that protection against severe disease was holding up.\n\nThen Omicron hit, which was an immune-evasive strain, and caused mild illness even in those who were vaccinated. I think this sort of led to a lot of confusion and ultimately led to a third dose and then to a fourth dose. And I think we used terms like 'fully vaccinated' as compared to 'fully vaccinated and up-to-date,' and I think it would be hard to find 10 Americans who would agree on what it means to be protected against this virus.\n\nFaust: I think that's fair. Now, I actually think this next question is sort of out of order, but I think it's important that we do it first. That is that you are, as I mentioned in the introduction, on the committee -- VRBPAC -- that looks at these questions of what we should do next and makes recommendations, and you voted against the bivalent booster. That is, using a booster that's got some of the old strain and some of the Omicron [strain] in it. You voted against that for the fall. I'd like you to talk us through your thought process and why you think that doing it your way would be better.\n\nOffit: The studies that were presented to us on June 28 of this year, 2022, by both Pfizer and Moderna were done the right way, which is to say they gave people three doses of the ancestral strain vaccine and then the fourth dose was either the ancestral strain vaccine or the fourth dose was a bivalent vaccine. The bivalent vaccine in both cases, for Pfizer and Moderna, was the ancestral strain plus BA.1, the original Omicron strain. They then looked at the difference in those neutralizing antibody responses based on whether you got the ancestral boost or whether you got the bivalent boost.\n\nWhat they found was -- depending on how the study was done because Pfizer did 30 mcg or 60 mcg and Moderna did 25 mcg for the ancestral and then 25 mcg for the Omicron strain -- they found that the difference in neutralizing antibodies was either 1.5-fold greater against neutralizing antibodies for Omicron if you got the bivalent strains compared to if you just got the ancestral strain, or 1.75 greater, or 1.97 greater.\n\nThe implication was that that's good enough; that those statistically significant differences were also clinically significant differences, when we knew that back in December of 2020 -- when you looked at the neutralizing antibody differences between Moderna and Pfizer -- there was roughly a twofold greater neutralizing antibody response for Moderna than Pfizer, but that didn't really matter in terms of protection against severe illness.\n\nSo why were we making this difference of 1.5-fold or 1.97-fold greater with the Omicron boost than the ancestral boost? Why were we making that seem as if that was going to be the answer to all our problems? Plus, the BA.1 strain is essentially gone. It's been replaced by BA.5/BA.4 and now BA.2.12.1, which are just Omicron subvariants that are somewhat distant from BA.1.\n\nSo where this is settled out is that I think the [Biden] administration is interested in having a bivalent vaccine where one of the strains is the ancestral strain and the other strain is BA.5. And we'll see, but I certainly hope that before they launch that kind of program for the American public, they show clear evidence that there is a dramatic increase in neutralizing antibodies with BA.5 associated with that boost. Because remember, even with boosting the ancestral strain, you do get somewhat of a broadening of immune response as Linda Saif and coauthors showed in a New England Journal Medicine paper at the end of June.\n\nSo I think that's the burden that it should be held to because otherwise it's just marketing, right? Otherwise it's like, 'I'm going to give you BA.5 because BA.5 is circulating and therefore it's going to be better,' which theoretically makes sense, but you need to have clear evidence, preferably clinical data, but at the very least compelling immunological data.\n\nFaust: Now, would moving to a bivalent booster just in general be progress against this concern about 'imprinting or antigenic sin'? The idea is that whatever your body sees first, it will sort of narrowly respond to that. Therefore in the future, your body doesn't have as good of a response because of what it initially saw. Does giving bivalent anything actually have some benefit just on those grounds?\n\nOffit: Again, it should be proven, but the imprinting thing was originally defined by a researcher named Thomas Francis, who was working with influenza back in the 50s, and he used the term 'original antigenic sin.' The thinking was this, you can tell when children were born based on the way they respond to influenza -- either natural infection or immunization -- because they respond as if they're responding to that original infection. The original infection that they had when they were children, if they then get a vaccine or a secondary infection, they're responding as if they're responding to that first infection and not recognizing the subtle differences with that either vaccine or natural infection.\n\nThat's what you worry about here, that you sort of lock people into this response against the ancestral strain and don't have the chance then to have a broader response.\n\nI will say this though, the ancestral strain is the original strain. It's the Wuhan strain. The one that first raised its head in Wuhan in October/November 2019 has served us well. I mean, all the way through, even including Omicron and the Omicron subvariants, it does appear to continue to protect against serious illness, which is the goal of this vaccine. At least it was the stated goal of this vaccine, but I feel like we're drifting a little bit from protection against serious illness to trying to protect against all illness.\n\nAnd I would argue that there are some people who can't handle a mild illness. They can't handle it because they have severe heart disease or severe lung disease or because they have out of control diabetes or whatever, so when they get a mild or moderate infection they're more likely to develop a severe illness or because they're immune compromised.\n\nSo that's different. That's really not fading memory, it's someone who either never had a very good immune response because they're immune compromised or because of their age they don't make very good so-called cytotoxic T-cell responses, so they're not as able to crowd the infection and keep it as a mild or moderate infection. You could argue that that group may benefit from a boost, if you will, to keep neutralizing antibodies high, to the extent they can make neutralizing antibodies for a few months during the times when these viruses are at peak circulation, you could make that argument. But I think we're sort of not making that argument; we're making the argument of boosters for all. And first of all, I think people are a little weary of boosters at this point.\n\nFaust: Yeah. I mean, the way I'm looking at it is that people who, as you mentioned, have another risk factor for hospitalization probably need to stay what we'd call 'up-to-date' on their vaccine so that they don't encounter mild illness because mild illness has implications for them that they don't have for others. It's not that they'll get severe disease; severe COVID, it's that that mild illness will make something else severe. That's what we keep seeing, and the data are bearing this out. So, absolutely, I think saying up-to-date for older populations makes sense.\n\nI don't think the mRNA vaccines are optimized for this, but they're the best we've got, so that's what we're stuck with for now. But I agree with you that we could kind of spend all of our effort on that group and have huge benefits instead of diffusing the efforts, the money, the signal, for very little in return.\n\nAs I think about younger people, some younger people obviously really want doses. They've bought into this idea that these vaccines can eliminate infection. I think you and I agree on this, the benefit for boosting for young people is very transient, if any, but over time I think arguments have been made that say, 'OK, look, there's a lot of good reasons to boost younger people.'\n\nWhere do you stand right now? Do you still think that two doses of the ancestral vaccine is sufficient for most people, and have you softened on third doses for younger people? I guess the third question of this three-part is: who do you think right now needs more than two doses?\n\nOffit: I still would argue that for a healthy young person, two doses appears to continue to protect against severe illness. What that third dose does do though for Omicron, meaning BA.1 and the Omicron subvariants, is you do get an increased response against those variants and subvariants.\n\nThe question is, does it matter? Because still it looks like you're protected against severe illness, so does it really matter to get that third dose? I would argue 'no.' [But] I think that ship has sailed. I think this is now a three-dose vaccine for the most part, because that's the way the press and the public have handled it, it's the way public administrators have handled it.\n\nBut I still would argue, if you looked at that Mark Tenforde paper that was published in Infectious Diseases, what he did was he looked at two doses for 1 year, up through December of 2021 so the vaccine had been out for a year -- so you're looking through the D614G variant, the Alpha variant, and the Delta variant -- and what he found was that protection against serious illness was holding up. And this was for...80% of the people in that group had at least one comorbidity and a significant percentage were over [age] 65. So that was holding up pretty well.\n\nBut then Omicron hit, and we clearly have shown that three doses is better than two for Omicron in terms of preventing hospitalization. My question is: who are those people? And I think that's not everybody.\n\nI still think it would be helpful for the CDC to sort of sub-stratify that. To some extent they have; they've shown us that at least 75% of those who are getting hospitalized despite having two doses were in these high-risk groups that we just talked about. So focus on them. I think that is what makes the most sense to me.\n\nFaust: Yeah. If you look at the CDC's readouts -- I think we've discussed this before offline, but I'm not sure we've discussed it in public -- it's actually very difficult to tell the difference between a person who got their second dose a year ago and a person who got their third dose a year ago. So the idea of the three-dose vaccine kind of only makes sense in that in the period of time for which a third dose increases those neutralizing antibodies.\n\nSo yes, you could tell the difference between someone who just got a third dose, but you also can't tell the difference between someone who just got a third dose and someone who just got their second dose. What really matters is how far are you out from your most recent dose, and I think that the public is basically not going to keep doing this except for high-risk groups. Is that a fair read?\n\nOffit: Very fair. And I think when we compare vaccinated to unvaccinated or got a two-dose versus three-dose you need to also account for who has gotten naturally infected in the meantime, because that does alter things. And it is knowable, I mean, you can know that by looking at say antibodies against, say, the nuclear protein, which is only going to happen if you've been naturally infected. So I think that also is one of the problems -- controlling for natural infection, which now is common.\n\nI remember when a couple months into this pandemic, Jon Yewdell, who was the head of virus research at the National Institutes of Health, said 3 years from now you're going to have two choices: be naturally affected or be vaccinated.\n\nIf you look at some of these recent seroprevalence studies, there was one in JAMA recently, showing that as many as 90% of people have either been naturally infected or vaccinated when they look at the thousands and thousands of lots of people who have donated blood. Now, that's limited by who chooses to donate blood, but I still think it is striking.\n\nFaust: Right. And I think maybe a cognitive shift that I made at some point was that you might not necessarily choose between infection or vaccination, but you have to choose infection with protection or infection without protection. In other words, you walk into that infection or that exposure with a vaccine on board or not, and you want to do that, obviously.\n\nI want to make sure that we don't make incorrect news here. You said that you think it's a three-dose vaccine, but you said that because you think that basically the scientific debate is over because no one is having it. Not because of science support stuff but basically due to marketing, is that correct?\n\nOffit: Yeah. I just got an email today from a mother of a college student who was upset that her child can't go to a certain East Coast school because he hasn't had his third dose. She argues reasonably -- he's a healthy young person, he's gotten two doses, he's a boy who is in an age range where he is at some risk for myocarditis, and I don't think the benefits outweigh the risks here. A perfectly reasonable argument. I agree. I agree with her.\n\nFaust: But I also think that, as my friend Carter Mecher pointed out to me when we discussed this like a year ago, that most people who get a third dose, even in that group of a young, healthy male, most people will be happy with their decision to get a third dose because for 99% it makes no difference. For a small, tiny group it would help; for a small, tiny group it would hurt.\n\nSo most people would just be happy with their decision because whatever they did, they think, 'Well, I got a third dose. I did my best.' Therefore the administration is saying, 'Well, look, if it breaks even we might as well just make everybody happy.'\n\nOffit: Yeah. There was an old study that was done at a Canadian racetrack where they asked people to rate their horse while they were on the way up to making the bet, then they asked a different group of people to rate their horse after they'd already made the bet. Obviously, after you already made the bet, you rated it much higher.\n\nBut what I loved about that article was the title, which was \"Post-decision dissonance at post time.\"\n\nFaust: Right. Post-vax something or other -- we could do it with that.\n\nThe mix and match, the idea of starting with one formulation of Pfizer and then boosting with Moderna, do you think it matters? Certainly, it has a little bit more of an antibody response and more side effects, but on a population level do you think it matters? If someone asks you, 'What should I do?,' what do you tell them?\n\nOffit: Wait for data. I mean, it is interesting to see some of these early reports now of boosting with Novavax, which is a purified protein vaccine that's adjuvanted with the same adjuvant that's used in Shingrix, which is an exceptional vaccine.\n\nIf you've already gotten, say, two doses or three doses of an mRNA vaccine and then you get this dose of Nova, the antibody studies, at least the small ones that have been reported so far, look promising.\n\nBut again, you ultimately need clinical data, and hopefully the CDC can help generate those data.\n\nEmily Hutto is an Associate Video Producer & Editor for MedPage Today.

This was despite over half of patients reporting dyspnea at 3 months, which largely persisted through 12 months.\n\nThe most frequent pathologies on echocardiography were:\n\nLow LV global longitudinal strain (19% at 3 months and 15% at 12 months, P=0.44)\n\nLow LV ejection fraction (16% and 14%, P=0.44)\n\nDiastolic dysfunction (13% and 17%, P=0.17)\n\nCardiac structure and function ultimately bore no relationship with shortness of breath. Furthermore, there was no significant change in arrhythmia burden between 3 and 12 months, reported Charlotte Ingul, MD, PhD, of Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, and colleagues of the PROLUN group. Their manuscript was published in Clinical Cardiology.\n\n\"Although we did not have pre\u2010COVID echocardiographic data on the participants, these findings suggest that there is limited long\u2010term cardiac remodeling and progressive dysfunction after hospitalization for COVID\u201019, and that cardiac recovery from the acute disease predominantly occurs within the first 3 months,\" the authors wrote.\n\nPrior studies have reported cardiac dysfunction in the acute phase of COVID illness. However, the long-term significance of a finding like diffuse fibrosis, myocardial edema, or myocardial scar is unclear.\n\nEven so, cardiac involvement long after SARS-CoV-2 infection is supported by the National COVID Cohort Collaborative's finding that incident heart failure (HF) increased by 45% after COVID hospitalization.\n\nAn author of that study, HF specialist Marat Fudim, MD, MHS, of Duke Clinical Research Institute in Durham, North Carolina, said he suspected this is driven by HF that is likely induced via a general deterioration of the cardiovascular and pulmonary state and makes itself apparent months to years later.\n\n\"How to square a relatively benign cardiac echocardiogram trend in the Norwegian study and repeat studies showing high HF incidence is that COVID is a multisystem disease and I suspect most of the harm is done outside the heart,\" Fudim told MedPage Today.\n\n\"Insults to the autonomic, pulmonary, and vascular system likely drive what we consider as long COVID. The heart might be more or less unharmed in those cases, yet patients suffer dyspnea, fatigue, dizziness, palpitations, and tachycardia,\" he said. \"Whether those cases can be all classified as HF or not I don't know.\"\n\nPROLUN was a prospective observational study conducted at six major hospitals in Norway.

        "An \"urgent need\" for data on scale and scope of the condition to improve treatment, authors say\n\nAug 04, 2022",
        "In the early days of the pandemic there was an understandable rush to define and optimally treat COVID-19. Anecdotal evidence and the opinions of eminent scientists and non-scientists overwhelmed social and mainstream media platforms only to eventually be overruled by the results of careful, scientific analyses and well-designed clinical trials. Now, more than 2 years into the pandemic, we must return to the standard of careful and thorough analyses for all interventions and treatments.\n\nThe debate about \"COVID-19 rebound\" after nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) treatment is one of these timely areas warranting further investigation. Continuing down the current path of uncertainty has consequences for how and by whom this antiviral should be used. However, by applying lessons learned from the early days of the pandemic -- including acknowledging the importance of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) -- we can avoid repeating the same mistakes. To do this, it is necessary to start by defining the question, identifying current knowledge gaps, and only then can one propose scientific solutions to bring a rapid resolution to the COVID-19 rebound controversy.\n\nThe Need for a Sound Definition Before Studying COVID-19 Rebound\n\nPaxlovid consists of two drugs: nirmatrelvir, which inhibits a SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibiting viral replication, and ritonavir, which slows the inactivation and breakdown of nirmatrelvir. Per a CDC health advisory released in May, COVID-19 rebound is defined as a return of symptoms or a \"new positive viral test after having tested negative\" occurring \"2 to 8 days after initial recovery.\" We just saw this over the weekend in the case of President Biden.\n\nThis definition of rebound is challenging and prone to inflating the incidence of rebound. It is possible some individuals identified as having \"Paxlovid rebound\" may have been experiencing a waxing and waning of COVID-19 symptoms while some unknown number of other reported rebound cases could be due to the known limitations of COVID-19 testing.\n\nFirst, infectious disease specialists have long witnessed that some respiratory illnesses can have a bimodal course. This phenomenon has been reported in patients with COVID-19, albeit best described in hospitalized patients with more severe disease. Additionally, secondary bacterial infections (e.g., sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia) have been known to occur after COVID-19, which could also be misidentified as COVID-19 rebound.\n\nSecond, COVID-19 antigen testing -- a convenient diagnostic tool -- does have limitations. It is plausible, for example, that some individuals, after getting COVID-19 and completing a course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, initially get a false negative test (especially if they have a low viral load); then, after testing again out of precaution a few days later, could get a positive result due to viable or dead viruses -- an antigen test cannot distinguish between them. Finally, some patients who have clinically recovered will continue with positive PCR COVID-19 testing for several weeks, which could explain some of the anecdotal reports of COVID-19 rebound.\n\nThird, recall bias is another challenge to defining COVID-19 rebound and its incidence. It is a well-known phenomenon that patients who receive a particular therapy are more likely to report side effects or symptoms during their clinical course compared to individuals who are not treated. Thus, the problem of identifying cases of COVID-19 rebound solely based on observational or anecdotal reports, and not as part of a controlled trial, is that the number of cases may be falsely increased.\n\nFew Studies Specifically Describe Paxlovid Rebound\n\nThe data supporting the existence of COVID-19 rebound after nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment is limited. Most studies were conducted prior to the emergence of Omicron and employ a retrospective design prone to various biases. Nonetheless, the data suggest the rebound phenomenon may occur in only a small number of high-risk patients and the findings to date don't offer sufficient evidence that it is definitely a result of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.\n\nA secondary analysis of the EPIC-HF trial (the basis for the antiviral's authorization) revealed that approximately 1% to 2% of all unvaccinated individuals (treated and untreated) tested positive after having a negative test. And a recently published study showed that COVID-19 rebound occurred in only four of 483 (0.8%) vaccinated, high-risk patients. The incidence of rebound among vaccinated and unvaccinated patients infected with the Omicron variant is unknown.\n\nThere are three notable, albeit small, case reports recently published in the medical literature regarding COVID-19 rebound after nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment. One non-peer-reviewed study describes 10 patients who experienced a relapse of symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 viral load following treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. The authors identified two instances of transmission during relapse. The second report, also not yet peer-reviewed, describes a single patient who experienced the return of symptoms and had culturable virus 5 days after completing a nirmatrelvir/ritonavir course. Because nirmatrelvir/ritonavir viral resistance was not noted nor did the patient demonstrate an absence of neutralizing antibodies, this raises the question of whether rebound could be a function of drug level in the individual's blood (while the dosage in the antiviral pill is consistent, not everyone absorbs the same amount or metabolizes it the same way). The third and most recent study has been peer-reviewed and describes a series of seven patients who experienced COVID-19 rebound, six of whom had recurrence of symptoms and one who was asymptomatic but had a repeat positive antigen test. While also limited in size, this study supports the findings of the previous two studies: three of the seven patients had culturable virus, suggesting that patients who experience COVID-19 rebound after nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may be infectious. However, there is no defined level of culturable virus that can identify patients who remain infectious/contagious. And fortunately, sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 virus from six of the seven patients did not identify any known antiviral resistant mutations.\n\nStudies That Could Shed Light on Paxlovid Rebound\n\nThe EPIC-SR trial enrolled 1,553 individuals between August 2021 and December 2021 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 who had a standard risk of progressing to severe disease. Pfizer has shared some of these results; however, these press releases have not mentioned COVID-19 rebound.\n\nAnother study, the PANORAMIC trial, is currently enrolling high-risk outpatients in the U.K., but like the EPIC-SR trial, it is unclear if rebound is among the study outcomes.\n\nTogether, these studies have the potential to both further define and report the incidence of rebound after nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. If these data were collected from the EPIC-SR trial then it should be released. And if the PANORAMIC trial is not already designed to identify cases of rebound, then the protocol should be amended accordingly.\n\nOnly an RCT Can Definitively Answer the Question of Paxlovid Rebound\n\nWhether nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is associated with COVID-19 rebound and how often this occurs can only be determined by a prospective double-blind RCT. The basis for the standard of care of hospitalized COVID-19 patients was largely defined by the results of large RCTs that meticulously detailed adverse events. In a similar fashion, an RCT performed with individuals at low risk for progression to severe disease who have been vaccinated or previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 need to be randomized to placebo or nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and then followed closely for rebound by evaluating symptoms, signs, and serial collection of both molecular tests and viral cultures, in conjunction with monitoring of close contacts to determine whether this is transmissible. This will define more precisely the rebound prevalence, clinical consequences, and infectiousness rates. One could also test to see if there is any benefit to treating rebound with an additional course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Despite reports of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir being prescribed to treat rebound, the CDC is not currently recommending this approach.\n\nWithout such a scientifically rigorous study, uncertainty will persist at a dire cost. Not knowing who best benefits from nirmatrelvir/ritonavir can result in its overuse, more drug-induced side effects, and the development of viral resistance. Additionally, some individuals who would benefit from nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may be hesitant to be treated because of the perceived risk of COVID-19 rebound. On the other hand, if COVID-19 rebound does occur due to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, then it is important to know the incidence, clinical, and microbiologic course, and whether additional treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is warranted.\n\nOnce again, the pandemic reminds us to hurry but not rush to judgement, to conduct well-designed clinical trials, and to learn from the results to improve patient care.\n\nDaniel A.

        "This webinar is brought to you by the Science /AAAS Custom Publishing Office\n\nSpatial phenotyping allows researchers to view, characterize, and quantify cells by lineage and variant with single-cell resolution in the context of an intact tissue sample. In areas such as oncology, immunology, and neurodegenerative and infectious diseases, it has opened new insights into the interplay between different cellular actors in promoting or suppressing disease. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a group 1 carcinogen, is a causative factor for nine different cancers that cause roughly 165,000 deaths globally each year. EBV is asymptomatically carried among almost all adults, with the virus persisting primarily in rare memory B cells. However, in some infected individuals, EBV is associated with the development of cancer. The immune microenvironment in which infected cells reside may influence or trigger cancer development, but it is still unknown how this occurs.\n\nThis webinar will address how spatial phenotyping is uniquely suited to outline one of the putative causative relationships between EBV infections, immunosuppression, and cancer.\n\n\n\nDuring this webinar, viewers will:\n\nLearn how a meticulously designed and highly specific antibody panel provides the sensitivity and specificity required to characterize Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)\n\nBe presented with a framework that associates specific EBV expression profiles with a unique tissue architecture and immune infiltrate\n\nDiscover how end-to-end analysis pipelines are used to examine high-dimensional spatial data\n\nUncover how cellular neighborhood analysis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma provides unbiased analysis of tissue microenvironments.\n\nThis webinar will last for approximately 60 minutes.",

I changed various details and added some clarifications during the publication process, which is, why the final published paper is considerably longer and contains some more details that had neither been contained in the long version that was published as a preprint nor in the supplemental material, for instance the back to the envelope calculations that show that our measures are well in agreement with those calculated from expected versions, as is done with capnography.

Also see a note about the terminology regarding preprint servers at the end.)\n\nRetracted\n\nExpressions of concern\n\nNote: Retraction Watch does not draw a distinction between withdrawal and retraction, because journals that have done so have typically done it to justify not saying anything about why a paper was retracted, and to sometimes make a paper disappear without a trace. Richard Sever, co-founder of bioRxiv and medRxiv, asked that we include a comment from him about how the processes for withdrawing preprints and retracting journal articles may differ: Journals may retract a paper at the authors\u2019 request and/or if the editors identify fundamental flaws that would have precluded acceptance if spotted during review. [RW: Note that some journals insist that they cannot make such moves without authors\u2019 permission.] A preprint is usually withdrawn only at an authors\u2019 request. A preprint server will not typically withdraw a flawed preprint against the wishes of the author, since the server made no claim to have peer-reviewed and certified the scientific content in the first place. At the same time, preprint servers *will* withdraw a preprint against the authors\u2019 wishes in instances of fraud, ethics violations, dangerous material, or legal issues. It is thus the nature of preprints that there will be some that contain errors but are not withdrawn and would not appear in the above list. [RW: The same is, of course, true of some papers in peer-reviewed journals.]\n\nLike Retraction Watch?

        "Published March 4, 2021\n\nJohns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, Emergency Department.\n\nJohns Hopkins Medicine is committed to providing equitable care to all, while improving the health and wellness of our patients, personnel and residents in all our neighboring communities.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has made existing health disparities even more apparent. In light of this concern, Johns Hopkins Medicine will continue to develop new ways to reach all populations \u2014 with specific consideration for vulnerable ones \u2014 to provide access to essential COVID-19 information and services. These include testing, care options, potential therapies, best practices to prevent the spread of illness, emotional support resources, language access options, and much more.\n\nWith highly effective vaccines now available to us in accordance with government supply distribution, we are focused on ensuring equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for eligible populations. To help achieve this, Johns Hopkins Medicine has mobilized a multidisciplinary task force specifically focused on vaccine distribution, with equity and inclusion built into its foundation.\n\nThrough this task force, we continue to reach out to all of our patients, our neighboring communities and our personnel in many ways:\n\nMyChart (available in English and Spanish.) is a secure website that provides your up-to-date medical information available to you about your care and your health care team.\n\nEfforts to Reach Our Patients\n\nAs government agencies continue to open vaccine eligibility to certain demographic groups, Johns Hopkins Medicine offers our patients information and access to resources through the MyChart electronic health record system, direct emails, our website, video content, social media, as well as through our health care providers and other referring physicians. Importantly, we ensure that we can reach our patients who may have limited computer or broadband access by providing a dedicated telephone call center that notifies patients of vaccine appointment availability. We also share information through local news and media outlets, as well as by sharing resources through community partner programs. We are committed to ensuring that our patients who want to be vaccinated receive the information they need \u2014 and, ultimately, the vaccine, as our supply allocations allow.\n\nRead more about efforts to reach our patients\n\nOutreach to Our Neighboring Communities\n\nJohns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center opened a drive-through testing site for COVID-19 patient referrals and other identified priority groups.\n\nJohns Hopkins Medicine also has various partnerships and programs in place to reach our neighbors in nearby communities. For example, our Maryland and Washington, D.C., providers continue to collaborate with local governments to help vaccinate specific groups, such as public school employees. In addition, we are going onsite to various senior housing facilities to vaccinate these highly vulnerable residents where they live. We are also working closely with the University of Maryland Medical System to operate the Baltimore Convention Center Field Hospital, which offers COVID-19 testing, monoclonal antibody infusion therapy, vaccinations, as well as clinical care.\n\nIn addition, we have mobilized teams that are going out into the community to provide services, including testing and vaccinations within neighborhoods that have had high numbers of COVID-19 illnesses. In a collaborative effort between the Johns Hopkins Medicine Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Health Equity, Johns Hopkins Medicine Language Services, and Centro Sol, a new pilot program \u2014 called Juntos \u2014 has helped to provide equitable resources to our Spanish-speaking inpatients with COVID-19. We are also leveraging well-established relationships with community and faith-based organizations to disseminate information about the vaccine.\n\nRead more about our outreach to neighboring communities\n\nConnecting with Our Personnel\n\nIncident Command Center\n\nAdditionally, our health care systemwide Incident Command Center and our diversity councils are collaborating to reach our personnel across their various roles within the health care system to ensure that they have all the vaccine information and access they need. Just as with our patients, we are leveraging MyChart for vaccine appointment scheduling and notifications. To further enable this, we have established MyChart activation and support stations in our hospitals to ensure that those personnel whose work is not computer-based will receive assistance with securing appointments.\n\nWe have also established a special telephone line for personnel who lack computer access or who may experience technology challenges with accessing a vaccine appointment. Knowing that different personnel receive information in different ways, we have developed multiple means of communication \u2014 including signs, videos, infographics and a dedicated internal website, among other things \u2014 to help provide critical information to our staff.\n\nAt Johns Hopkins Medicine, we remain focused on creating effective and meaningful programs to ensure that our personnel, patients and neighboring communities feel they have the information and access they need to COVID-19 resources to remain informed and healthy.\n\nFor more information about COVID-19 and important resources.

        "\n\nFinding that the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted best antibiotic practices and efforts to reduce antimicrobial-resistant infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced plans to strengthen antibiotic stewardship and infection prevention programs against future healthcare disruptions, in their 2022 Special Report, COVID-19 US Impact on Antimicrobial Resistance.\n\n\"As the pandemic pushed healthcare facilities, departments and communities near their breaking points in 2020, we saw a significant increase in antimicrobial use, difficulty in following infection prevention and control guidance, and a resulting increase in healthcare-associated, antimicrobial-resistant infections in US Hospitals,\" Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH, CDC director, wrote in her forward to the report.\n\nIn response, the CDC is exploring investments in the US infrastructure that could help improve the resilience and effectiveness of these systems, including:\n\nSupporting uninterrupted laboratory supplies and equipment for patient care, infection control, and data tracking during emergencies and surge outbreaks\n\nMerging strategies to respond to COVID-19 and antimicrobial-resistance such as using telehealth for contact tracing, supporting specimen self-collection, and offering express clinics that allow walk-in testing for sexually transmitted infections\n\nExpanding use of automated data to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) to reduce manual data collection and submission for areas such as antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance\n\nIncreased investments are also anticipated in healthcare training and education; with new initiatives, and expansion of programs like the CDC's Project Firstline, which was developed at the start of the pandemic to help meet infection control education needs of the diverse healthcare workforce.\n\n\"It is essential to train anyone working in a healthcare on infection prevention and control and to maintain thee practices to protect themselves, their coworkers and their patients,\" The CDC report states.\n\nAdditional investments are expected to extend to state and local health departments, as part of the CDC's CARB (Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria) National Action Plan.

        "Medicine is always looking for novel ways to treat diseases and conditions, whether it be through agents, devices or some other unique modality. And this certainly applies to COVID-19. Aethlon Medical has developed its Hemopurifier, which is a therapeutic device designed for the single use depletion of circulating viruses and exosomes from the blood.\n\nThe San Diego, Calif.,-based medical technology company has been focusing on developing products to diagnose and treat life and organ threatening diseases. Specifically, when it comes to COVID-19, the company performed an in vitro study with its Hemopurifier, that was published in bioRxiv.\n\nIn their study, known concentrations of seven clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 variants were passed 3 times over columns containing 1 gram of Galanthus nivalis Agglutinin (GNA) affinity resin. The percent decrease in viral titer was compared with a control sample. Viral capture efficiency with the GNA affinity resin ranged from 53% to 89% for all variants tested. Extrapolation of these data would indicate that the binding capacity of the Hemopurifier for viral loads observed in adult patients with severe COVID-19 infection would be more than sufficient.\n\nThe Hemopurifier holds a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) breakthrough device designation related to life-threatening viruses that are not addressed with approved therapies. In June 2020, the FDA approved an amendment to Aethlon's existing open IDE for the Hemopurifier in life threatening viral infections, to allow for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection. This will allow for up to 40 of these patients to be treated under a new Early Feasibility Study protocol at up to 20 clinical sites in the United States.\n\nContagion recently spoke to Aethlon CEO Charles Fisher, Jr., MD, and Aethlon CMO Steven LaRosa, MD, who were the study\u2019s lead author and coauthor respectively.

        "\n\nA new study from the Netherlands shows the lingering effects of COVID-19. According to a large Dutch study published in The Lancet, 1 in 8 adults who are infected with virus feel long term symptoms.\n\n\n\nThe study comes from data gathered within Lifelines, a multidisciplinary, prospective, population-based, observational cohort study examining the health and health-related behaviors of people living in the north portion of the Netherlands.\n\nThe participants were 18 years of age or older. They were sent invitations to digital COVID-19 questionnaires, used longitudinal dynamics of 23 somatic symptoms surrounding COVID-19 diagnoses (due to SARS-CoV-2 alpha [B.1.1.7] variant or previous variants) were assessed using 24 repeated measurements between March 31, 2020, and Aug 2, 2021.\n\n\u201cThere is urgent need for data informing the scale and scope of the long-term symptoms experienced by some patients after COVID-19 illness,\u201d Professor Judith Rosmalen from the University of Groningen, lead author of the study, said. \u201cHowever, most previous research into long COVID has not looked at the frequency of these symptoms in people who haven\u2019t been diagnosed with COVID-19 or looked at individual patients\u2019 symptoms before the diagnosis of COVID-19.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven after the acute virus has dissipated, some patients still feel the lingering effects of COVID-19 several months after first becoming infected. In fact, the investigators discovered that several symptoms were new or more severe 3 to 5 months after having COVID-19, compared to symptoms before a COVID-19 diagnosis and to the control group, suggesting these symptoms can be viewed as the core symptoms of long COVID.\n\n\n\nCore symptoms recorded were chest pain, difficulties breathing, pain when breathing, painful muscles, loss of taste and/or smell, tingling hands/feet, a lump in throat, alternately feeling hot and cold, heavy arms and/or legs and general tiredness. The severity of these symptoms plateaued at 3 months after infection with no further decline. Other symptoms that did not significantly increased 3 to 5 months after a COVID-19 diagnosis included headache, itchy eyes, dizziness, back pain and nausea.\n\nOf the study participants who had submitted pre-COVID symptom data, the investigators found that 21.4% (381/1,782) of COVID-19-positive participants, compared to 8.7% (361/4,130) of the control group, experienced at least one increased core symptom at moderate severity 3 months or more after SARs-CoV-2 infection. This implies that in 12.7% of COVID-19 patients their new or severely increased symptoms three months post-COVID can be attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n\n\n\u201cBy looking at symptoms in an uninfected control group and in individuals both before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, we were able to account for symptoms which may have been a result of non-infectious disease health aspects of the pandemic, such as stress caused by restrictions and uncertainty,\u201d Aranka Ballering PhD candidate and first author of the study, said.\n\n\n\nSome of the limitations of the study included patients infected with the Alpha variant or earlier variants of SARS-CoV-2 and has no data from people infected during the period when the Delta or Omicron variants were causing most infections. Additionally, due to asymptomatic infection, the prevalence of COVID-19 in this study may be underestimated.\n\n\n\nAnother limitation to this study is that since the beginning of data collection other symptoms, such as brain-fog, have been identified as potentially relevant for a definition of long COVID but this study did not look at these symptoms. Furthermore, the study was undertaken in one region and did not include and ethnically diverse population.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "Welcome back to Contagion\u2019s new podcast, Contagion Community, where we delve into some of the social factors that create and widen healthcare disparities.\n\nThis Pride month, Contagion Community is highlighting the healthcare needs and disparities unique to the LQBTQ+ community. Joining us for June\u2019s podcast are Steven Wolfe, DO, MPH, and Stuart A Fisk, CRNP, of the Allegheny Health Network (AHN).\n\nFisk and Wolfe work with LGBTQ people who are living with HIV. In this episode, they delve into the intersectionality of the disease, emphasizing that HIV prevention and treatment is especially needed for transgender people of color.\n\nWolfe and Fisk both identify as gay men, and thus have a personal as well as professional stake in ensuring LGBTQ+ people have access to comprehensive healthcare.\n\n\u201cWe need more physicians, like myself, out there who really understand what the community\u2019s needs are,\u201d Wolfe said.\n\nAsked about the current state of the HIV epidemic, Wolfe said, \u201c62% of people who are trans and Black have HIV\u2026I think we\u2019re going in the right direction, but I think that we need a lot more work when we\u2019re thinking about the minority populations.\u201d\n\nFisk added that 25-30% of people newly diagnosed with HIV are being diagnosed at the end stages of the disease. \u201cWe do not test people routinely for HIV,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have the biomedical ability to end a pandemic as tragic as this one, and not do it because we\u2019re failing to give people a $2 test, is really a bad thing.\u201d\n\nBesides testing, Wolfe said pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is another HIV preventative measure that is vastly underutilized. Wolfe cited study data suggesting 96% of transgender women were aware of PrEP, \u201cbut the reality of it is only 32% of transgender women were actually using PrEP to prevent HIV. That\u2019s a huge gap.\u201d\n\nFisk pointed out that similar disparities exist for injection drug users, who are at high risk of getting HIV but are \u201crarely if ever\u201d offered PrEP. \u201cPeople of color in general who have risk of HIV acquisition are typically not being offered PrEP or do not take PrEP.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem is that HIV carries the stigma of the populations that it most impacts,\u201d Fisk said, noting that our society\u2019s criminalization of queerness, homelessness, and injection drug usage exacerbates HIV disease disparities. \u201cThe HIV pandemic has always been as much a social and political pandemic as it\u2019s been a medical pandemic. Until we deal with those political and social issues that create risk, we will not see the end to this pandemic.\u201d\n\nFisk has been working with marginalized people since the beginning of his nursing career, which he says has helped him become a better healthcare provider and a better human.\n\nWolfe noted that caring for people living with HIV is often not only about providing healthcare, but also mitigating the stigma these patients may have experienced throughout their lives. \u201cThe HIV pandemic has always been as much a social and political pandemic as it\u2019s been a medical pandemic. Until we deal with those political and social issues that create risk, we will not see the end to this pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe experts emphasized that HIV and LGBTQ+ healthcare should not be seen as specialized care. \u201cThis is care that should be integrated with regular primary care,\u201d Fisk said, with Wolfe adding, \u201cA transgender person should not have to go to an endocrinologist to get their hormones.\u201d\n\nAllegheny Health Network\u2019s Positive Health Clinic has 3 different locations in the Pittsburgh area of western Pennsylvania.

        "At more than 2 years into the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been significant advances in treatment and prevention options. COVID-19 mRNA vaccination is highly effective against severe disease and death, but highly infectious variants like Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 are causing breakthrough infections, leading cases to rise once again.\n\nTo prevent older or otherwise immunocompromised people from severe or fatal infection, Synairgen is developing SNG001, an inhalable COVID-19 treatment for hospitalized persons.\n\nDr. Phillip Monk, the Chief Scientific Officer at Synairgen, joined Contagion to discuss the SNG001 trial data Synairgen presented at the American Thoracic Society 2022 International Conference, held in San Francisco last month.\n\nSNG001 is a formulation of Interferon-beta (IFN-\u03b2), a naturally occurring protein that catalyzes the body\u2019s antiviral response. SARS-CoV-2 suppresses this protein, so the inhalable IFN-\u03b2 directly targets the lungs, the primary site of the COVID-19 viral reservoir.\n\nSNG001 may retain some efficacy against the Omicron variant. As a host-directed antiviral, Monk says, SNG001 has \u201cbroad spectrum antiviral potential.\u201d \u201cWe have in the lab actually shown the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b2 against Omicron as we have against other variants\u201d\n\nThe phase 3 SPRINTER trial (SG018; NCT04732949) was a global, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical study. The trial evaluated inhaled SNG001 to treat adults hospitalized with COVID-19 who required supplemental oxygen. SPRINTER included 624 participants, randomly assigned to either SNG001 (n = 309) or placebo (n = 314) in addition to standard of care.\n\nIn February 2022, Synairgen announced that SPRINTER did not meet its primary endpoints of hospital discharge and illness recovery. Monk says that this can be partially attributed to the standard-of-care COVID-19 treatments improving so much that SNG001 had to demonstrate a greater significance of disease reduction. \u201cBecause patients are doing so much better, it\u2019s much more difficult to show treatment effect on things like hospital discharge,\u201d Mock explained.\n\nDespite the efficacy of vaccines and other antivirals, there are still COVID-19 mortalities. Monk says over 2000 patients are being hospitalized in the US each day, and about 200 people a day are dying of COVID-19.\n\nAmong the trial participants given SNG001, there was a signal in reduction in the relative risk of progression to severe disease or death within 35 days. Monk said that the greatest treatment benefits were observed in older patients, patients with comorbidities, and especially in people who had poor respiratory function at baseline.\n\n\u201cThese are people who are having to breathe faster or have low oxygen saturation despite being on oxygen,\u201d Monk said, noting that this treatment population saw a relative risk reduction of 70% for severe disease.",
        "Background\n\nVaccines are effective in preventing death or severe illness from COVID-19, a disease for which few treatments are available. Widespread vaccination against COVID-19 may help protect those not yet able to get vaccinated. However, many people do not want to get vaccinated against COVID-19. This can put them at increased risk of severe disease and death.\n\nWhat was our aim?\n\nWe wanted to find out which interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake have been or are currently evaluated.\n\nMethods\n\nWe searched medical databases and trial registries until the 11 of October 2021. We included all studies investigating interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake. We excluded studies looking at other vaccines, for example, measles. We included all forms of studies as long as they had more than 100 participants.\n\nOnce we found the studies, we categorised the interventions into the following groups: communication interventions, policy interventions, interventions to improve access, educational interventions, incentives, and multidimensional interventions. We summarised the results in an interactive scoping map. Furthermore, we mapped the study outcomes, the country in which the study was conducted, the study population, and the study design.\n\nResults\n\nWe included 96 studies in evidence mapping, 35 of which are ongoing and 61 studies with published results. The interventions tested in these studies are very diverse. Many studies used communication strategies to convince people to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Interventions that included information on vaccination or a mixture of different strategies were also often used.\n\nA majority of studies were conducted in English-speaking countries of the global north, for example, the USA. Moreover, most studies investigated digital interventions in an online setting. The populations addressed varied across the studies. For example, studies addressed healthcare workers, ethnic minorities in the USA, students, soldiers, villagers, at-risk patients, or the general population.\n\nFor an overview, please see the interactive scoping map (https://tinyurl.com/2p9jmx24).\n\nConclusion\n\nWe identified a large number of studies that investigate how COVID-19 vaccine uptake might be increased. However, more studies are needed focusing on lower-middle-income countries and on children. Future research should compare the effectiveness of different interventions to improve COVID-19 vaccine uptake.",
        "Key messages\n\n\u2022 Rapid antigen tests are most accurate when they are used in people who have signs or symptoms of COVID-19, especially during the first week of illness. People who test negative may still be infected.\n\n\u2022 Rapid antigen tests are considerably less accurate when they are used in people with no signs or symptoms of infection, but do perform better in people who have been in contact with someone who has confirmed COVID-19.\n\n\u2022 The accuracy of rapid antigen tests varies between tests that are produced by different manufacturers and there is a lack of evidence for many commercially available tests.\n\nWhat are rapid point-of-care antigen tests for COVID-19?\n\nRapid point-of-care tests aim to confirm or rule out COVID-19 infection in people with or without COVID-19 symptoms. They:\n\n\u2022 are portable, so they can be used wherever the patient is (at the point-of-care) or in non-healthcare settings such as in the home;\n\n\u2022 are easy to perform, with a minimum amount of extra equipment or complicated preparation steps;\n\n\u2022 are less expensive than standard laboratory tests;\n\n\u2022 do not require a specialist operator or setting; and\n\n\u2022 provide results \u2018while you wait\u2019.\n\nFor this review we were interested in rapid antigen tests, sometimes referred to as \u2018lateral flow tests\u2019. These tests identify proteins on the virus in samples taken from the nose or throat. They come in disposable plastic cassettes, similar to over-the-counter pregnancy tests.\n\nWhy is this question important?\n\nPeople with suspected COVID-19 need to know quickly whether they are infected, so that they can self-isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. Currently, COVID-19 infection is confirmed by a laboratory test called RT-PCR, which uses specialist equipment and often takes at least 24 hours to produce a result.\n\nIn many places, rapid antigen tests have opened access to testing for many more people, with and without symptoms, and in locations other than healthcare settings. Faster diagnosis of COVID-19 infection could allow people to take appropriate action more quickly, with the potential to reduce the spread of COVID-19, but it is important to understand how accurate they are and the best way to use them.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to know whether commercially available, rapid point-of-care antigen tests are accurate enough to diagnose COVID-19 infection reliably, and to find out if accuracy differs in people with and without symptoms.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe looked for studies that measured the accuracy of any commercially produced rapid antigen test in people who were also tested for COVID-19 using RT-PCR. People could be tested in hospital, in the community or in their own homes. Studies could test people with or without symptoms.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe included 155 studies in the review. The main results are based on 152 studies investigating a total of 100,462 nose or throat samples; COVID-19 was confirmed in 16,822 of these samples. Studies investigated 49 different antigen tests. Around 60% of studies took place in Europe.\n\nMain results\n\nIn people with confirmed COVID-19, antigen tests correctly identified COVID-19 infection in an average of 73% of people with symptoms, compared to 55% of people without symptoms. Tests were most accurate when used in the first week after symptoms began (an average of 82% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). This is likely to be because people have the most virus in their system in the first days after they are infected. For people with no symptoms, tests were most accurate in people likely to have been in contact with a case of COVID-19 infection (an average of 64% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests).\n\nIn people who did not have COVID-19, antigen tests correctly ruled out infection in 99.6% of people with symptoms and 99.7% of people without symptoms.\n\nDifferent brands of tests varied in accuracy. Summary results (combined from more than one study per test brand) for seven tests met World Health Organization (WHO) standards as \u2018acceptable\u2019 for confirming and ruling out COVID-19 in people with signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Two more tests met the WHO acceptable standard in one study each. No test met this standard when evaluated in people without symptoms.\n\nUsing summary results for symptomatic people tested during the first week after symptoms began, if 1000 people with symptoms had the antigen test, and 50 (5%) of them really had COVID-19:\n\n\u2022 45 people would test positive for COVID-19. Of these, 5 people (11%) would not have COVID-19 (false positive result).\n\n\u2022 955 people would test negative for COVID-19. Of these, 10 people (1.0%) would actually have COVID-19 (false negative result).\n\nIn people with no symptoms of COVID-19 the number of confirmed cases is expected to be much lower than in people with symptoms. Using summary results for people with no known exposure to COVID-19 in a bigger population of 10,000 people with no symptoms, where 50 (0.5%) of them really had COVID-19:\n\n\u2022 62 people would test positive for COVID-19. Of these, 30 people (48%) would not have COVID-19 (false positive result).\n\n\u2022 9938 people would test negative for COVID-19. Of these, 18 people (0.2%) would actually have COVID-19 (false negative result).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nIn general, studies used relatively rigorous methods, particularly for selecting participants and performing the tests. Sometimes studies did not perform the test on the people for whom it was intended and did not follow the manufacturers\u2019 instructions for using the test. Sometimes the tests were not carried out at the point of care. Studies used less rigorous methods for confirming the presence or absence of COVID-19 infection; 91% of studies relied on a single negative RT-PCR result as evidence of no COVID-19 infection. Results from different test brands varied, and relatively few studies directly compared one test brand with another. Finally, not all studies gave enough information about their participants for us to judge how long they had had symptoms, or even whether or not they had symptoms.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nIn people with symptoms, some rapid antigen tests are accurate enough to replace RT-PCR, especially for ruling in the presence of infection. Alternatively, where RT-PCR is available, rapid antigen tests could be used to select which people with symptoms require further testing with RT-PCR, thereby reducing the burden on laboratory services. This would be most useful when quick decisions are needed about patient care, to identify outbreaks, to allow people to self-isolate more quickly, or to initiate contact tracing. Rapid antigen tests are less good at ruling out infection in symptomatic people - individuals who receive a negative rapid antigen test result may still be infected.\n\nRapid antigen tests are less accurate when used in people with no symptoms of COVID-19. More evidence is needed to understand the accuracy of rapid testing in people without symptoms and the extent to which repeated testing strategies can lead to reduced transmission, either for tests carried out at home or in non-healthcare settings such as schools. There is no independent evidence to support the use of many test brands. More direct comparisons of test brands are needed, with testers following manufacturers\u2019 instructions.\n\nHow up-to-date is this review?\n\nThis review updates our previous review and includes evidence published up to 8 March 2021.",

        "Key messages\n\n\u2022 The antibiotic azithromycin is not an effective treatment for COVID-19.\n\n\u2022 We don\u2019t know whether antibiotics other than azithromycin are effective treatments for COVID-19 because there is not enough research.\n\n\u2022 We found 19 ongoing studies that are investigating antibiotics for COVID-19. We will update this review if their results change our conclusions.\n\nWhat are antibiotics?\n\nAntibiotics are cheap and common medicines used to treat bacterial infections. However, recent laboratory studies found that some antibiotics slowed the reproduction of some viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In laboratory tests, one antibiotic, azithromycin, reduced viral activity and inflammation, and so it has been studied as a potential treatment for COVID-19. We need good evidence before giving antibiotics for COVID-19 because overuse or misuse of antibiotics can lead to \u2018antimicrobial resistance\u2019, where organisms that cause infection change, so that antibiotics stop working.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to know if antibiotics reduce death, severity of disease, and length of infection in people with COVID-19, if they have an effect on quality of life or cause unwanted effects. We included studies that compared antibiotics to placebo (dummy treatment), no treatment, usual care, another antibiotic, or treatments for COVID-19 that are known to work to some extent, such as remdesivir or dexamethasone. We excluded treatments that we know do not work for COVID-19, such as hydroxychloroquine, or have an unknown influence on the disease.\n\nWe evaluated the effects of antibiotics on people with COVID-19 on:\n\n\u2022 people dying;\n\n\u2022 whether people's COVID-19 symptoms got better or worse;\n\n\u2022 unwanted effects;\n\n\u2022 heart rhythm problems;\n\n\u2022 quality of life.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for studies that investigated antibiotics to treat people with COVID-19 in hospital or as outpatients.\n\nWe compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on common criteria such as study methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe found 11 studies with 11,281 people that investigated antibiotics to treat COVID-19. All 11 studies investigated azithromycin. Nine studies (10,807 people) compared azithromycin to no treatment, placebo or usual care alone. Two studies compared azithromycin to another antibiotic: lincomycin (1 study, 24 people) and clarithromycin (1 study, 450 people), however, they did not report data that we could use in this review, so our results apply to azithromycin only.\n\nSeven studies included people with moderate to severe COVID-19 in hospital and four studies included outpatients with mild COVID-19. The studies used different doses of azithromycin and different durations of treatment.\n\nWe found 19 ongoing studies. We have not classified 15 completed studies because we are waiting for more information from the authors, or they have not yet been published.\n\nMain results\n\nInpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19\n\nAzithromycin compared to usual care alone, does not lead to more or fewer deaths in the 28 days after treatment (4 studies, 8600 people).\n\nCompared to usual care alone or placebo, azithromycin probably does not:\n\n\u2022 worsen (1 study, 7311 people) or\n\n\u2022 improve patients\u2019 condition (3 studies, 8172 people);\n\n\u2022 increase or decrease serious unwanted events (4 studies, 794 people), and heart rhythm problems (4 studies, 7865 people).\n\nAzithromycin may increase non-serious unwanted effects slightly compared to usual care alone (3 studies, 355 people).\n\nNo studies looked at quality of life.\n\nOutpatients with mild COVID-19\n\nCompared to usual care alone or placebo azithromycin may make little or no difference to:\n\n\u2022 people dying in the 28 days after treatment (3 studies, 876 people);\n\n\u2022 whether the people's disease worsened in the 28 days after treatment (3 studies, 876 people) or\n\n\u2022 whether people's COVID-19 symptoms got better in the 14 days after treatment (1 study, 138 people).\n\nWe don't know whether azithromycin compared to usual care alone or placebo increases or decreases serious unwanted effects (2 studies, 454 participants).\n\nNo studies reported non-serious unwanted events, heart rhythm problems, or quality of life.\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nWe are very confident in the evidence on azithromycin for COVID-19 inpatients. However, we are less confident in the evidence on azithromycin in outpatients, mainly because there were few studies that also had some flaws, therefore we could not draw reliable conclusions. We found relevant evidence on only one antibiotic, azithromycin, so we do not know the effects of other antibiotics for treating COVID-19. We will continue to search for new studies to fill this evidence gap. Our evidence does not suggest azithromycin is an effective treatment for COVID-19, especially given the danger of antimicrobial resistance. Azithromycin or any other antibiotic should not be used to treat COVID-19 outside well-designed studies.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe evidence is up to date to 14 June 2021.",
        "Is ivermectin effective for COVID-19?\n\nKey messages\n\nWe found no evidence to support the use of ivermectin for treating COVID-19 or preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. The evidence base improved slightly in this update, but is still limited.\n\nEvaluation of ivermectin is continuing in 31 ongoing trials, and we will update this review again when their results become available.\n\nWhat is ivermectin?\n\nIvermectin is a medicine used to treat parasites, such as intestinal parasites in animals, and scabies in humans. It is inexpensive and is widely used in regions of the world where parasitic infestations are common. It has few unwanted effects.\n\nMedical regulators have not approved ivermectin for COVID-19.\n\nWhat did we want to find out?\n\nWe wanted to update our knowledge of whether ivermectin reduces death, illness, and length of infection in people with COVID-19, or is useful in prevention of the infection. We included trials comparing the medicine to placebo (dummy treatment), usual care, or treatments for COVID-19 that are known to work to some extent, such as dexamethasone. We excluded trials comparing ivermectin to other medicines that do not work, like hydroxychloroquine, or whose effectiveness against COVID-19 is uncertain.\n\nWe evaluated the effects of ivermectin in infected people on:\n\n\u2013 people dying;\n\n\u2013 whether people's COVID-19 got better or worse;\n\n\u2013 quality of life;\n\n\u2013 serious and non-serious unwanted effects;\n\n\u2013 viral clearance.\n\nFor prevention, we sought the effect on preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease.\n\nWhat did we do?\n\nWe searched for randomized controlled trials that investigated ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19. People treated in hospital or as outpatients had to have laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.\n\nIn this update, we also investigated the trustworthiness of the trials and only included them if they fulfilled clear ethical and scientific criteria.\n\nWe compared and summarized the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on common criteria such as trial methods and sizes.\n\nWhat did we find?\n\nWe excluded seven of the 14 trials included in the previous review as these trials did not fulfil the expected ethical and scientific criteria. Together with four new trials, we included 11 trials with 3409 participants that investigated ivermectin combined with any usual care compared to the same usual care or placebo.\n\nFor treatment, there were five trials of people in hospital with moderate COVID-19 and six trials of outpatients with mild COVID-19. The trials used different doses of ivermectin and different durations of treatment.\n\nNo trial investigated ivermectin to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nWe also found 31 ongoing trials, and an additional 28 trials still requiring clarification from the authors or not yet published.\n\nMain results\n\nTreating people in hospital with COVID-19\n\nWe do not know whether ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment:\n\n\u2013 leads to more or fewer deaths (3 trials, 230 people);\n\n\u2013 worsens or improves patients' condition, assessed by need for ventilation or death (2 trials, 118 people);\n\n\u2013 increases or reduces serious unwanted events (2 trials, 197 people).\n\nIvermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, may make little or no difference to:\n\n\u2013 improving patients' condition, assessed by discharge from hospital (1 trial, 73 people);\n\n\u2013 non-serious unwanted events (3 trials, 228 participants).\n\nSeven days after treatment, ivermectin may make little or no difference to reduction of negative COVID-19 tests (3 trials, 231 participants) compared with placebo or usual care.\n\nTreating outpatients with COVID-19\n\nIvermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, probably makes little or no difference to people dying (6 trials, 2860 people).\n\nIvermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, makes little or no difference to quality of life (1 trial, 1358 people).\n\nIvermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, may make little or no difference to:\n\n\u2013 worsening patients' condition, assessed by admission to hospital or death (2 trials, 590 people);\n\n\u2013 serious unwanted events (5 trials, 1502 people);\n\n\u2013 non-serious unwanted events (5 trials, 1502 participants);\n\n\u2013 improving people's COVID\u201019 symptoms in the 14 days after treatment (2 trials, 478 people);\n\n\u2013 number of people with negative COVID-19 tests 7 days after treatment (2 trials, 331 people).\n\nWhat are the limitations of the evidence?\n\nOur confidence in the evidence, especially for outpatients, improved since the last review version, because we could look at more participants included in high-quality trials. Although we are quite certain regarding our results on risk of people dying and quality of life, the confidence in the evidence is still low for many other outpatient and inpatient outcomes because there were only few events measured. The methods differed between trials, and they did not report everything we were interested in, such as relevant outcomes.\n\nHow up to date is this evidence?\n\nThe systematic literature search is up to date to 16 December 2021. Additionally, we included trials with > 1000 participants up to April 2022.",
        "August 5, 2022\n\nexpert reaction to latest stats from the ONS COVID-19 Infection Survey, UK: 5 August 2022\n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS), have released the latest data from their COVID-19 Infection Survey.\n\nProf Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine, UEA, said:\n\n\u201cUp to about 2 weeks ago the proportion of people testing positive for covid was continuing to fall in all four nations. More recent data from the DHSC dashboard published on Wednesday, the ZOE app (published today) and NHS England hospital activity figures (published yesterday) show that infections and hospital admissions are continuing to fall in the time period since the most recent data included in today\u2019s ONS bulletin. Even deaths within 28 days of a positive test are now falling. At present there are no variants that I can see in the COG UK data that are bucking the trend. Even the BA.2.75 \u201cCentaurus\u201d lineage is not increasing, so hopefully this decline will be sustained for several weeks yet.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/5august2022\n\nAll our previous output on this subject can be seen at this weblink:\n\nwww.sciencemediacentre.org/tag/covid-19\n\nDeclared interests\n\nFor all other experts, no reply to our request for DOIs was received.",

        "AUGUSTA, Ga. (Aug. 8, 2022) \u2013 Fatigue and headache were the most common symptoms reported by individuals an average of more than four months out from having COVID-19, investigators report.\n\nMuscle aches, cough, changes in smell and taste, fever, chills and nasal congestion were next in the long line of lingering symptoms.\n\n\u201cOur results support the growing evidence that there are chronic neuropsychiatric symptoms following COVID-19 infections,\u201d Medical College of Georgia investigators write in the journal ScienceDirect.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of symptoms that we did not know early on in the pandemic what to make of them, but now it\u2019s clear there is a long COVID syndrome and that a lot of people are affected,\u201d says Dr. Elizabeth Rutkowski, MCG neurologist and the study\u2019s corresponding author.\n\nThe published study reports on preliminary findings from the first visit of the first 200 patients enrolled in the COVID-19 Neurological and Molecular Prospective Cohort Study in Georgia, or CONGA, who were recruited on average about 125 days after testing positive for the COVID-19 virus.\n\nCONGA was established at MCG early in the pandemic in 2020 to examine the severity and longevity of neurological problems and began enrolling participants in March 2020 with the ultimate goal of recruiting 500 over five years.\n\nEighty percent of the first 200 participants reported neurological symptoms with fatigue, the most common symptom, reported by 68.5%, and headache close behind at 66.5%. Just over half reported changes in smell (54.5%) and taste (54%) and nearly half the participants (47%) met the criteria for mild cognitive impairment, with 30% demonstrating impaired vocabulary and 32% having impaired working memory.\n\nTwenty-one percent reported confusion, and hypertension was the most common medical condition reported by participants in addition to their bout with COVID-19.\n\nNo participants reported having a stroke, weakness or inability to control muscles involved with speaking, and coordination problems were some of the less frequently reported symptoms.\n\nTwenty-five percent met the criteria for depression, and diabetes, obesity, sleep apnea and a history of depression were associated with those who met the criteria. Anemia and a history of depression were associated with the 18% who met the objective criteria for anxiety.\n\nWhile the findings to date are not surprising and are consistent with what other investigators are finding, Rutkowski says the fact that symptoms reported by participants often didn\u2019t match what objective testing indicated, was surprising. And, it was bidirectional.\n\nFor example, the majority of participants reported taste and smell changes, but objective testing of both these senses did not always line up with what they reported. In fact, a higher percentage of those who did not report the changes actually had evidence of impaired function based on objective measures, the investigators write. While the reasons are not certain, part of the discrepancy may be a change in the quality of their taste and smell rather than pure impaired ability, Rutkowski says.\n\n\u201cThey eat a chicken sandwich and it tastes like smoke or candles or some weird other thing but our taste strips are trying to depict specific tastes like salty and sweet,\u201d Rutkowski says. Others, for example, may rely on these senses more, even when they are preparing the food, and may be apt to notice even a slight change, she says.\n\nEither way, their data and others suggest a persistent loss of taste and smell following COVID-19, Rutkowski and her colleagues write.\n\nMany earlier reports have been based on these kinds of self-reports, and the discrepancies they are finding indicate that approach may not reflect objective dysfunction, the investigators write.\n\nOn the other hand, cognitive testing may overestimate impairment in disadvantaged populations, they report.\n\nThe first enrollees were largely female, 35.5% were male. They were an average of 44.6 years old, nearly 40% were Black and 7% had been hospitalized because of COVID-19. Black participants were generally disproportionately affected, the investigators say.\n\nSeventy-five percent of Black participants and 23.4% of white participants met criteria for mild cognitive impairment. The findings likely indicate that cognitive tests assess different ethnic groups differently. And, socioeconomic, psychosocial (issues like family problems, depression and sexual abuse) and physical health factors generally may disproportionately affect Black individuals, the investigators write. It also could mean that cognitive testing may overestimate clinical impairment in disadvantaged populations, they write.\n\nBlack and Hispanic individuals are considered twice as likely to be hospitalized by COVID-19 and ethnic and racial minorities are more likely to live in areas with higher rates of infection. Genetics also is a likely factor for their increased risk for increased impact from COVID, much like being at higher risk for hypertension and heart disease early and more severely in life.\n\nA focus of CONGA is to try to better understand how increased risk and effects from COVID-19 impact Blacks, who comprise about 33% of the state\u2019s population.\n\nA reason fatigue appears to be such a major factor among those who had COVID-19 is potentially because of levels of inflammation, the body\u2019s natural response to an infection, remain elevated in some individuals. For example, blood samples taken at the initial visit and again on follow up showed some inflammatory markers were up and stayed up in some individuals.\n\nThese findings and others indicate that even though the antibodies to the virus itself may wain, persistent inflammation is contributing to some of the symptoms like fatigue, she says. She notes patients with conditions like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, both considered autoimmune conditions that consequently also have high levels of inflammation, also include fatigue as a top symptom.\n\n\u201cThey have body fatigue where they feel short of breath, they go to get the dishes done and they are feeling palpitations, they immediately have to sit down and they feel muscle soreness like they just ran a mile or more,\u201d Rutkowski says.\n\n\u201cThere is probably some degree of neurologic fatigue as well because patients also have brain fog, they say it hurts to think, to read even a single email and that their brain is just wiped out,\u201d she says. Some studies have even shown shrinkage of brain volume as a result of even mild to moderate disease.\n\nThese multisystem, ongoing concerns are why some health care facilities have established long COVID clinics where physicians with expertise in the myriad of problems they are experiencing gather to see each patient.\n\nCONGA participants who reported more symptoms and problems tended to have depression and anxiety.\n\nProblems like these as well as mild cognitive impairment and even impaired vocabulary may also reflect the long-term isolation COVID-19 produced for many individuals, Rutkowski says.\n\n\u201cYou are not doing what you would normally do, like hanging out with your friends, the things that bring most people joy,\u201d Rutkowski says. \u201cOn top of that, you may be dealing with physical ailments, lost friends and family members and loss of your job.\u201d\n\nFor CONGA, participants self-report symptoms and answer questions about their general state of health like whether they smoked, drank alcohol, exercised, and any known preexisting medical conditions. But they also receive an extensive neurological exam that looks at fundamentals like mental status, reflexes and motor function. They also take established tests to assess cognitive function with results being age adjusted. They also do at-home extensive testing where they are asked to identify odors and the ability to taste sweet, sour, bitter, salty, brothy or no taste. They also have blood analysis done to look for indicators of lingering infection like those inflammatory markers and oxidative stress.\n\nNeuropsychiatric symptoms are observed in the acute phase of infection, but there is a need for accurate characterization of how symptoms evolve over time, the investigators write.\n\nAnd particularly for some individuals, symptoms definitely linger. Even some previously high-functioning individuals, who normally worked 80 hours a week and exercised daily, may find themselves only able to function about an hour a day and be in the bed the remainder, Rutkowski says.\n\nThe investigators are searching for answers to why and how, and while Rutkowski says she cannot yet answer all their questions, she can tell them with certainty that they are not alone or \u201ccrazy.\u201d\n\nOne of the best things everyone can do moving forward is to remain diligent about avoiding infection, including getting vaccinated or boosted to help protect your brain and body from long COVID symptoms and help protect others from infection, Rutkowski says. There is evidence that the more times you are infected, the higher the risk of ongoing problems.\n\nRutkowski notes that their study findings may be somewhat biased toward high percentages of ongoing symptoms because the study likely is attracting a high percentage of individuals with concerns about ongoing problems.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is thought to have first infected people in late 2019 and is a member of the larger group of coronaviruses, which have been a source of upper respiratory tract infections, like the common cold, in people for years.\n\nAt least part of the reason SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have such a wide-ranging impact is that the virus is known to attach to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, or ACE2, which is pervasive in the body. ACE2 has a key role in functions like regulating blood pressure and inflammation. It\u2019s found on neurons, cells lining the nose, mouth, lungs and blood vessels, as well as the heart, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. The virus attaches directly to the ACE2 receptor on the surface of cells, which functions much like a door to let the virus inside.\n\nExperience and study since COVID-19 started both indicate immediate neurological impact can include loss of taste and smell, brain infection, headaches and, less commonly, seizures, stroke and damage or death of nerves. As time has passed, there is increasing evidence that problems like loss of taste and smell, can become chronic, as well as problems like brain fog, extreme fatigue, depression, anxiety and insomnia, the investigators write. Persistent conditions including these and others are now referenced as \u201clong Covid.\u201d\n\nThe research was supported by funding from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and philanthropic support from the TR Reddy Family Fund.\n\nRead the full study.",
        "Review\n\nThe Lancet Rheumatology Vol. 4 Published: August, 2022\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic represents one of the biggest challenges of the 21st century. In addition to the general effect on society and health-care systems, patients with systemic sclerosis and their physicians face specific challenges related to the chronic nature of their disease, the involvement of multiple organs, and the use of immunosuppressive treatments. Data from registries and single centre cohorts indicate that the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 does not seem to increase substantially in people with systemic sclerosis; conversely, severe COVID-19 outcomes are seen more frequently in these patients than in the general population.",
        "Background\n\nLittle is known about vaccine effectiveness over time among adolescents, especially against the SARS-CoV-2 omicron (B.1.1.529) variant. This study assessed the associations between time since two-dose vaccination with BNT162b2 and the occurrence of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 among adolescents in Brazil and Scotland.\n\nMethods\n\nWe did test-negative, case-control studies in adolescents aged 12\u201317 years with COVID-19-related symptoms in Brazil and Scotland. We linked records of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and antigen tests to national vaccination and clinical records. We excluded tests from individuals who did not have symptoms, were vaccinated before the start of the national vaccination programme, received vaccines other than BNT162b2 or a SARS-CoV-2 booster dose of any kind, or had an interval between their first and second dose of fewer than 21 days. Additionally, we excluded negative SARS-CoV-2 tests recorded within 14 days of a previous negative test, negative tests recorded within 7 days after a positive test, any test done within 90 days after a positive test, and tests with missing sex and location information. Cases (SARS-CoV-2 test-positive adolescents) and controls (test-negative adolescents) were drawn from a sample of individuals in whom tests were collected within 10 days of symptom onset. We estimated the adjusted odds ratio and vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 for both countries and against severe COVID-19 (hospitalisation or death) for Brazil across fortnightly periods.\n\nFindings\n\nWe analysed 503 776 tests from 2 948 538 adolescents in Brazil between Sept 2, 2021, and April 19, 2022, and 127 168 tests from 404 673 adolescents in Scotland between Aug 6, 2021, and April 19, 2022. Vaccine effectiveness peaked at 14\u201327 days after the second dose in both countries during both waves, and was significantly lower against symptomatic infection during the omicron-dominant period in Brazil (64\u00b77% [95% CI 63\u00b70\u201366\u00b73]) and in Scotland (82\u00b76% [80\u00b76\u201384\u00b75]), than it was in the delta-dominant period (80\u00b77% [95% CI 77\u00b78\u201383\u00b73] in Brazil and 92\u00b78% [85\u00b77\u201396\u00b74] in Scotland). Vaccine efficacy started to decline from 27 days after the second dose for both countries, reducing to 5\u00b79% (95% CI 2\u00b72\u20139\u00b74) in Brazil and 50\u00b76% (42\u00b77\u201357\u00b74) in Scotland at 98 days or more during the omicron-dominant period. In Brazil, protection against severe disease remained above 80% from 28 days after the second dose and was 82\u00b77% (95% CI 68\u00b78\u201390\u00b74) at 98 days or more after receiving the second dose.\n\nInterpretation\n\nWe found waning vaccine protection of BNT162b2 against symptomatic COVID-19 infection among adolescents in Brazil and Scotland from 27 days after the second dose. However, protection against severe COVID-19 outcomes remained high at 98 days or more after the second dose in the omicron-dominant period. Booster doses for adolescents need to be considered.\n\nFunding\n\nUK Research and Innovation (Medical Research Council), Scottish Government, Health Data Research UK BREATHE Hub, Fiocruz, Fazer o Bem Faz Bem programme, Brazilian National Research Council, and Wellcome Trust.\n\nTranslation\n\nFor the Portuguese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.",
        "Background\n\nIn May, 2022, several European countries reported autochthonous cases of monkeypox, which rapidly spread globally. Early reports suggest atypical presentations. We aimed to investigate clinical and virological characteristics of cases of human monkeypox in Spain.\n\nMethods\n\nThis multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study was done in three sexual health clinics in Madrid and Barcelona, Spain. We enrolled all consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed monkeypox from May 11 to June 29, 2022. Participants were offered lesion, anal, and oropharynx swabs for PCR testing. Participant data were collected by means of interviews conducted by dermatologists or specialists in sexually transmitted infections and were recorded using a standard case report form. Outcomes assessed in all participants with a confirmed diagnosis were demographics, smallpox vaccination, HIV status, exposure to someone with monkeypox, travel, mass gathering attendance, risk factors for sexually transmitted infections, sexual behaviour, signs and symptoms on first presentation, virological results at multiple body sites, co-infection with other sexually transmitted pathogens, and clinical outcomes 14 days after the initial presentation. Clinical outcomes were followed up until July 13, 2022.\n\nFindings\n\n181 patients had a confirmed monkeypox diagnosis and were enrolled in the study. 166 (92%) identified as gay men, bisexual men, or other men who have sex with men (MSM) and 15 (8%) identified as heterosexual men or heterosexual women. Median age was 37\u00b70 years (IQR 31\u00b70\u201342\u00b70). 32 (18%) patients reported previous smallpox vaccination, 72 (40%) were HIV-positive, eight (11%) had a CD4 cell count less than 500 cells per \u03bcL, and 31 (17%) were diagnosed with a concurrent sexually transmitted infection. Median incubation was 7\u00b70 days (IQR 5\u00b70\u201310\u00b70). All participants presented with skin lesions; 141 (78%) participants had lesions in the anogenital region, and 78 (43%) in the oral and perioral region. 70 (39%) participants had complications requiring treatment: 45 (25%) had a proctitis, 19 (10%) had tonsillitis, 15 (8%) had penile oedema, six (3%) an abscess, and eight (4%) had an exanthem. Three (2%) patients required hospital admission. 178 (99%) of 180 swabs from skin lesions collected tested positive, as did 82 (70%) of 117 throat swabs. Viral load was higher in lesion swabs than in pharyngeal specimens (mean cycle threshold value 23 [SD 4] vs 32 [6], absolute difference 9 [95% CI 8\u201310]; p<0\u00b70001). 108 (65%) of 166 MSM reported anal-receptive sex. MSM who engaged in anal-receptive sex presented with proctitis (41 [38%] of 108 vs four [7%] of 58, absolute difference 31% [95% CI 19\u201344]; p<0\u00b70001) and systemic symptoms before the rash (67 [62%] vs 16 [28%], absolute difference 34% [28\u201362]; p<0\u00b70001) more frequently than MSM who did not engage in anal-receptive sex. 18 (95%) of 19 participants with tonsillitis reported practising oral-receptive sex. The median time from onset of lesions to formation of a dry crust was 10 days (IQR 7\u201313).\n\nInterpretation\n\nIn our cohort, monkeypox caused genital, perianal, and oral lesions and complications including proctitis and tonsillitis. Because of the variability of presentations, clinicians should have a low threshold for suspicion of monkeypox. Lesion swabs showed the highest viral loads, which, combined with the history of sexual exposure and the distribution of lesions, suggests close contact is probably the dominant transmission route in the current outbreak.\n\nFunding\n\nNone.",

        "During the past 15 years allergic reactions to latex have become a significant public health problem, particularly among health-care workers. Approximately 800,000 American adults and children have become allergic to natural rubber latex, found in gloves and pacifiers. When exposed to latex or latex dust, sensitized persons can develop hives, nasal and eye irritation, asthma, and anaphylaxis, a life-threatening condition in which the breathing passageways swell closed. About 1% of the general public and 4.5% to 17% of health-care workers and others exposed to latex on their jobs have become sensitized. Some have even been forced to terminate their careers for this reason. Medical and dental procedures on sensitized individuals may be complicated by anaphylactic events, as may the use of latex pacifiers by infants. The FDA has received more than 2000 reports of injury and several reports of death associated with latex allergy. In 1996, the agency published regulations that would require all latex-containing gloves and other devices to be labeled accordingly, including warnings about possible allergic reactions.\n\nLatex is a common component of disposable gloves, intravenous tubing, syringes, stethoscopes, catheters, dressings, bandages, and other medical supplies. Among health-care workers, gloves are the most significant source because they are frequently used, and the powder used to line some of them can absorb latex proteins and become airborne. Asthmatic reactions have occurred among people who did not use gloves but merely inhaled latex-containing dust. Thus, sensitive workers can be affected not only by their own gloves but also by those worn by co-workers.\n\nThe surge of latex allergy among health-care workers is primarily attributable to greater use of disposable gloves to prevent the spread of AIDS and hepatitis B. Increased demand and cost pressures for gloves has led some manufacturers to shorten the manufacturing time by reducing the number of washing and purifying steps, which increases the amount of sensitizing protein that the gloves will transmit.\n\nThe American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology has published guidelines and recommends that people who have been diagnosed as allergic wear an identification card (or bracelet) and a self-injectable adrenalin device. Sensitive individuals should be sure that their health-care providers are aware of their condition so that they are not exposed to latex during medical procedures or surgery. A few states have introduced bills to ban the use of powdered latex gloves in medical facilities.\n\nFor Further Information",
        "There certainly must exist an old English proverb warning, \u201cHe who carries coals to Newcastle runs grave risk of being burned.\u201d I must admit that I have felt uncomfortably warm of late in contemplating my presentation before this seminar, in which laetrile should constitute a principal ingredient of my remarks. Some of you have devoted weeks of your lives to concern over this unorthodox cancer treatment and have played major roles in helping the Commissioner prepare his decision on laetrile\u2019s status at the end of the rulemaking procedure called for by the 10th Circuit Court. This decision, published in the Federal Register on August 5, 1977 seems to me the most thorough, broad-gauged, and insightful analysis of a highly touted but ineffective product, the mode of its promotion, and the psychology of its acceptance that I have ever read.\n\nWhat then, in the company of you experts, can I say that will not seem oppressively like res adjudicata or d\u00e9ja vu? So as to gain what I hope may be a fresh perspective, let me try to differentiate between what might be called endemic and epidemic quackery, essaying some historical epidemiology to point to factors present when epidemics occur. Endemic quackery has existed in the world, to quote Voltaire, since the first knave met the first fool. As long as some diseases remain unconquered and death marks the certain terminus of our earthly pilgrimage, and as long as an ethical medical profession abstains from promising the impossible, the unscrupulous will boldly cater to our often desperate hopes. Therefore, a certain basic level of quackery, I take for granted, has existed in all places and at all times and is destined to continue. Occasionally, as one scans the past, he can detect an outburst of quackish energy that I should like to designate as an epidemic. Sometimes a single promotion achieves such a status. At other times the epidemic level consists of a congeries of separate ventures. Before getting to laetrile, let me discuss briefly one epidemic promotion and one epidemic period from the American past.\n\nIn 1796, 180 years before the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, the federal government took perhaps its initial action regarding a medical device. In that year the government granted the first patent issued under the Consti\u00adtution in the area of health to a Connecticut physician for \u201cImproving Pain, Etc., by Metallic Points.\u201d Elisha Perkins\u2019 famous \u201ctractors\u201d furnished the new nation\u2019s first example of a health quackery epidemic.\n\nAlways in such single-promotion epidemics, it seems to me, an ingenious promoter, or group of promoters, shrewdly devises and/or luckily falls upon an approach that meshes with remarkable pertinence into key elements of the prevailing social climate. In Perkins\u2019 case these elements were fascination with electricity and cultural nationalism.\n\nA small-town country doctor probably trained by apprenticeship to his father, Perkins discovered that he could ease pains in various parts of his patients\u2019 bodies by drawing the blade of his penknife across the skin above the hurting parts and that he could relieve headaches by the ministration of a lacquered iron comb. He also observed that sometimes muscles contracted suddenly when touched during surgery by his knife. Knowing about Franklin and Mesmer, reading an account of Galvani\u2019s experiments, Perkins did what many would-be innovators before and since have done, he compressed what he had heard and observed into a simple theory. Almost all painful conditions, he concluded, especially gout, pleurisy, rheumatism, violent insanity, \u201cinflammatory tumors,\u201d and yellow fever, resulted from a surcharge of an electric fluid that accumulated in the bodily parts. This could be released by drawing a metal point across the afflicted surface, always moving from the center toward the extremities, thus ending pain and working a cure. Asserting in his letters the necessity and propriety of making money from his discovery- Perkins bad a family of ten children to support\u2013, this Yankee from the Nutmeg state shifted his therapeutic instrument from simple knife and comb to specially fabricated devices, a pair of small pointed metal \u201ctractors,\u201d called so because they pulled out pain. Made in a furnace in Perkins\u2019 home, the two tractors were composed of secret alloys, one gold in color, the other silver. In time, forgetting the knife and comb, Perkins insisted that only his patented points would work. Perhaps he became genuinely persuaded such was the case. In the history of quackery many schemers have become converts to the gospel of their own oratory. Perkins sold his tractors for $25 a pair, in his day a princely sum.\n\nElectricity was much in the air in the 18th century, and to posit an electrical cause for most diseases and a sort of miniature lightning rod cure struck the popular mind as both exciting and plausible. At least one testimonial, from a leading figure in the American Philosophical Society, compared Perkins\u2019 achievement favorably with Franklin\u2019s famous experiment and disparaged critics of Perkinism as similar to the English philosophers who had attacked the Philadelphia sage.\n\nThis linkage with Franklin underlined the proud fact that Perkins\u2019 pur\u00adported breakthrough was an American discovery. In the aftermath of a successful Revolution, cultural nationalism blazed brightly in the new nation. Dr. Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and now the most distinguished physician in the land, argued that there existed in the United States twenty times more intellect and a hundred times more knowledge than there had been in the American colonies before the war. Could it not be, Perkins\u2019 champions queried jubilantly, that a nation which had provided the perfect example of freedom to the world might not also, through the metallic tractors, provide the means to universal health?\n\nPerkins\u2019 shrewd decision to get his tractors patented fit in neatly with this patriotic theme. In truth, patenting was still a very simple practice requiring no proof of an invention\u2019s utility, but a patent could easily appear to be a symbol of governmental backing, even the consummate testimonial to healing potency. Perkins took immediate steps to bolster this sentiment among potential customers. At the very time the state medical society in Connecticut was ousting him for having \u201cgleaned up\u201d his tractors \u201cfrom the miserable remains of animal magnetism,\u201d Perkins labored to find distinguished buyers in Philadelphia, the nation\u2019s capital. And he succeeded. Several members of the Congress acquired a pair. So did the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who wrote a letter praising the tractors to future Chief Justice Marshall. And a pair of the metallic points seems to have been bought by President Washington himself. With the three branches of the government thus leading the way, Americans engaged in a frenzy of \u201cgalvanizing trumpery.\u201d\n\nAs these events demonstrate, Perkins had first-rank promotional talents. Prior to the tractors, he had added to his medical fees income secured from trading mules. His vigorous, magnetic personality certainly had much to do with both his therapeutic and his marketing successes. His series of testi\u00admonial pamphlets shows that Perkins worked as effectively in print as in face-\u00adto-face encounter. He gave tractors to some clergymen, along with a certificate saying they had bought them. And, despite their high cost, the metallic points sold well. An account suggests that people sold horses and carriages in order to buy them, and in one case a Southern plantation.\n\nPerkins countered the opposition of his erstwhile fellows in the Connecticut medical society as the unorthodox almost always do. He accused them of blind\u00adness and greed. And he pointed out that some physicians supported his discovery, despite \u201cmenaces\u201d from the stodgy establishment.\n\nBesides electrical wonder and cultural nationalism, a third factor in the climate of the 1790s may have aided Perkinism to reach epidemic proportions. This was fear of yellow fever. That dread disease appeared again and again during the decade, including devastating attacks on Northern cities. In the Philadelphia epidemic of 1793 Perkins himself had lost a daughter, son-in-law, and two grandchildren. So a special poignancy marks his inclusion of yellow fever among the ailments amenable to tractor treatment. And the surest proof that Perkins placed great faith in the efficacy of his patented points comes from his going to New York in 1799 when that city lay prostrate in the grip of yellow fever to treat the ill by plying his device. He could not save himself. He contracted the fever end died of it.\n\nPerkins\u2019 death ended the American boom. A British craze, perhaps even more frenetic, engineered by one of Perkins\u2019 sons, vanished when a provincial physician demonstrated that he could get just as enthusiastic patient response by using wooden tractors painted gold and silver as he could secure wielding the authentic patented points.\n\nSome writers, admitting Perkins\u2019 desire for money and his convenient forgetfulness about penknife and comb while later stressing that only the twenty-five dollar tractors possessed therapeutic efficacy, nonetheless wonder if it is appropriate to term him a quack. As his way of death demonstrates, they argue, he believed in his product, and therefore could not be a fraud. Does quackery require fraudulency? Does one \u201cknowingly\u201d have to sin or err in these matters to run afoul of the moral or statutory laws? Yes, said Congress in the 1912 Sherley Amendment. But I prefer\n\nBut I prefer to stand with the 1938 law\u2019s negative, and even apply the principle retrospectively, granting some diffi\u00adculties as one moves backward in time and acknowledging, under this definition, that some \u201cquacks\u201d are more reprehensible than others. To pin down the term , social result as well as personal motive must be taken into account. To the patient-victim it makes no difference whether his self-asserted savior lies brazenly or speaks what he himself ignorantly believes to be the truth.\n\nThe period I wish to point to in which no single promotion dominated but which saw the overall level of quackery reach epidemic proportions covers roughly the middle third of the 19th century. In many ways during these years the social fabric of the nation underwent fundamental change. Quacks and sectarians attuned to the new currents and maneuvering cleverly within their imperatives managed to flourish mightily.\n\nIn its political dimension, the period began with Jacksonian democracy, which discredited an older elite leadership and broadened political power among the populace. In an intellectual sense during these years all branches of the educated establishment suffered widespread popular suspicion and scorn. \u201cThe priest, the doctor, and the lawyer,\u201d wrote an untutored New Englander, all stood convicted of \u201cdeceiving the people.\u201d Orthodox physicians learned nothing about the nature of medicine, he added, except \u201chow much poison . . . could be given without causing death.\u201d This jab at the heroic practice of the regulars had some pertinence~ and quacks were frequently to make it even while they themselves ladled out huge doses of opium and mercury. But it was the lofty status and established power of the educated which came espe\u00adcially under attack. The so-called state \u201cBla.ck Laws\u201d by rich orthodoxy sought to monopolize medical practice irked a growing breed of irregulars. \u201cWe go for free trade in doctoring,\u201d a Cincinnatian wrote in 1849; \u201cmedicine, like theology, should be divorced from the State, and . . . . as in the dif\u00adferent sects of religionists, the various medical systems . . . [should] be treated alike.\u201d Licensing laws were swept away, and Thomsonians, homeopaths, hydropaths, and almost anyone who wanted to could practice. The patent medicine side of quackery profited from other facets of burgeoning democracy, which expanded the newspaper press at the same time that it schooled more people to a level of literacy capable of reading the nostrum advertising which the new journals contained.\n\nIn this atmosphere of freedom, as the common man increasingly made up his own mind about his health, he bought more patent medicines. The right of choice stimulates pride, fires ambition, but also provokes anxiety. Which of the many voices appealing for favor could best be believed? Hard, sharp, unscrupulous bargaining reigned in the realm of both thought and trade. Life became intensely competitive. Tricksters proliferated, and victimization was rampant. Everyone expected roguery, anticipated being cheated, himself sought to cheat in turn. Nor, within limits, did people mind being hoodwinked.\n\nThey had made their own decisions, taken their chances in a free environment. Sometimes they were bound to lose. Indeed, clever imposture tended to amuse them. Such was the state of the popular mind as the sales of nostrums soared. This picture of the period emerges from Neil Harris\u2019 brilliant book on \u201cthe art of P. T. Barnum,\u201d titled Humbug.\n\nCoinciding with these complex aspects of freedom\u2019s ferment, the arrival of the romantic movement also helped quackery along. A romantic climate, Grete de Francesco has written, favors \u201call sorts of nature cures\u201d and \u201cthe development of a new kind of imposture: a falsification of Nature through overemphasis on the natural.\u201d All over America, as vell as in Europe, lay healers in rustic settings employed a variety of \u201cnatural\u201d remedies, water being especially prominent. Among those bemoaning the increasing artificiality of life, a preoccupation began with the \u201cnatural\u201d diet. Not that critique of the normal diet was not deserved. But some sages went much further. Sylvester Graham plotted a dietary regimen that he hoped might restore the pristine conditions and the purity of life in the Garden of Eden. Graham\u2019s ideas influenced the doctrines of new religions, the prescriptions of unorthodox physicians, and the promotions of patent medicine vendors.\n\nPlease do not get the idea that I am decrying democracy, freedom, and romanticism because they provided an environment in which clever promoters could manipulate such currents so as to produce an epidemic of quackery. It is Just my hope, of course, to use history to help reveal the dynamism of a perennial threat.\n\nSo far I have spoken of pre-germ theory days when the yardstick of orthodoxy could not by the nature of things measure quackery with the precision of our own times. Therefore, it is a paradoxical phenomenon deserving our earnest scrutiny that probably the single quackery promotion receiving the largest amount of public attention in all our nation\u2019s history should be one of our own day. What mesh of elements from the social climate and maneuvers by its promoters explain the sensational epidemic of laetrile?\n\nBasic, of course, are both the facts and the image of cancer in our society. With the decline of contagious diseases as a cause of death, due to sanitation, vaccines, and chemotherapy, cancer has risen to second place in the mortality lists. The 1900 death rate from malignant neoplasms was 64 per 100,000 deaths, the 1969 rate 160. On the disease and death front then, cancer and its mortality, have moved more to the center of public attention. In light of chemo\u00adtherapeutic miracles, the public wonders uneasily, why can\u2019t there be such a miracle involving cancer? This sense of urgency transmits itself to the Congress which allocates more money which, in turn, increases preoccupation with the disease.\n\nYet the image of cancer may be an even more important force for quackery than its factual circumstances. Heart deaths exceed cancer deaths, but no waves of unorthodox cardiovascular cure-alls have surfaced similar to those in the cancer field, although perhaps obesity remedies may contain an element of this. All diseases possess a popular image. A sports columnist wrote recently that, as a boy, O J. Simpson suffered from rickets, which made him bow-legged and pigeon-toed and forced him to wear his shoes on the wrong feet. In college O.J. told his friends that he had been attacked by polio, because he considered polio a much classier disease than rickets.\n\nThrough most of history the big killers have been pneumonias and gastro\u00adintestinal disorders, taken for granted by the populace because so common and familiar. What brought panic were diseases that caused less loss of life overall, but killed swiftly and painfully when they did come in epidemics, diseases possessing horrible external lesions, like smallpox, cholera, and the yellow fever which Elisha Perkins sought to cure. The fear of leprosy also greatly exceeded its morbidity. Syphilis, in English Restoration drama, was a subject of stock humor: the saddle nose, the falling hair, the aching bones brought gales of laughter from the audience as characteristics of the combatant who had lost in Venus\u2019 wars. In the romantic 19th century, syphilis ceased to be a hilarious disease and became a moral cataclysm. Under the romantic impact, tuberculosis gained the distinction of being the ennobling way to die. Lesions were hidden inside the body. As the consumptive wasted away, his mind was said to become more ethereal and spiritual as he gradually ascended toward his heavenly reward. Nor was this vision a male prerogative: recall the heroines of all these tragic operas.Indeed, for both men and women, a sort of tubercular standard of beauty came to prevail. If one could not achieve the proper paleness, frailness, and slenderness by contracting the disease, diet might lead to the desired result. Published beauty counsel suggested banning butter, cream, milk, cheese, fish, and vegetables. Sometimes small doses of arsenic were prescribed.\n\nThese examples illustrate how the image of a disease can have a powerful influence on conduct. [After drafting this paper I was intrugued to find a more elaborate discussion of the disease theme in the current (January 26) issue of the New York Review of Books. I direct your attention to Susan Sontag\u2019s most perceptive analysis called Illness as Metaphor] That centuries ago cancer began to acquire a hostile and terrifying image may be deduced from the fact that the word \u201ccancer\u201d itself derives from the Greek word for crab. The crawling spread of cancer, gradual but relentless, whether exteroal and observable or internal and secretive, through the centuries appeared to be, and indeed a.mounted to, a sentence of death. This image hangs on, a powerful force in men\u2019s minds, a force not adequately updated by the victories orthodoxy increasingly has won. No doubt orthodoxy\u2019s message, ever more encouraging but never completely reassuring, cannot hope to compete with the frenzied fear, deeply embedded in the folk tradition and constantly revivified by the camp meeting oratory of orthodoxy\u2019s opponents. Here is Harry Hoxsey writing two decades ago on page 1 of his book entitled You Don\u2019t Have to Die: \u201cSuppose you suddenly discovered that you have cancer. A horrible crab-like disease has invaded your body, is gnawing your flesh, has pushed greedy tentacles into your vital organs. A loathsome scavenger slowly and inexorably is consuming you alive, cell by cell.\u201d And, of course, the unorthodox make orthodox weapons against the disease seem as terrifying as the disease itself. It was a laetrile champion who recently spoke scornfully of regular medicine\u2019s \u201ccutting, burning, and poisoning.\u201d\n\nThe assertiveness of the cancer theme among the varieties of quackery available preceded the laetrile epidemic. In recent years, as Wallace Janssen has so vividly pointed out in FDA Consumer, the names of Koch and Hoxsey and the brand name Krebiozen have achieved high public recognition.\n\nBesides cancer\u2019s image as an element of popular culture helping explain the laetrile boom, other facets of the broad climate are involved. The whole trend of 20th century thought, for example, has brought us to new and gloomy versions of romanticism. As our century opened, the prevailing mood was cheerful and so hopeful about the future that progress seemed inevitable. Science had much to do with this, having revealed a comfortable, homey universe working by natural laws. The methods of science seemed transferable to the study of social situations, offering the prospect of resolving society\u2019s strains. Morality was palpable; people discussed all questions in moral terms with nary a blush. Americans as openly esteemed patriotism as morality, antici\u00adpating a great future destiny for the nation. Leaders were generally esteemed. Goodness marked basic human nature, and man\u2019s transgressions resulted not from evil but from error. Education would eliminate error, as technology would banish poverty. One seer welcomed the new century by taking material progress for granted, then adding: \u201cLaws are becoming more just, rulers humane; music is becoming sweeter and books wiser; homes are happier, and the individual heart becoming at once more just and more gentle.\u201d\n\nThings did not continue quite along this line. Relativity and indeter\u00adminacy replaced certainty in science, and the fixity of other 19th century solids also dissolved, including morality. Inevitable progress fell under the impact of a series of terrible wars. The inherent goodness of human nature, battered by new schools of philosophy, crumbled under the revelations from the German concentration camps. The belief in education as a social panacea withered. Science-technology inventiveness did continue to produce wondrous products for mankind\u2019s benefit, but also devised nuclear weapons and polluted the atmosphere. A kind of confident, reasonable, cheerful 19th century syn\u00adthesis gradually came apart, as the 13th century Thomistic synthesis broke up in the 14th century. At this juncture we cannot detect a new Renaissance that might re-establish a common confidence and faith. Rather the omens are disheartening.\n\nA whole host of new religions have sprung up seeking to win the adherence of distraught humankind. As in the 14th century, some of them seem diabolical. Since modern urban industrial civilization strikes many people as part of the problem, some disturbed souls strive to return to nature. Pressing upon this long developing major crisis of belief came Vietnam,. an unpopular, unsuccessful var that put generations at each other\u2019s throats, and Watergate, a seeming indisputable proof of what some voices had long been crying, that blame for discontents could be laid upon leadership.\n\nIn my bones, I feel sure that such a setting as I have quickly sketched provides an atmosphere for the flourishing of quackery. Those questing for new faith are terribly vulnerable to false prophets. The widespread distrust of established authorities encompasses those who traditionally have sought to protect the public from charlatanry. The medical profession su1\u2019fers sus\u00adpicion, including the specialists within it concerned with cancer. In the behavioral survey of health practices and opinions sponsored by the FDA and six other federal agencies and released five years ago, it was concluded that 42% of American adults would not be persuaded by almost unanimous expert opinion that a purported \u201ccancer cure\u201d held out false hope. And, of course, distrust of authority also encompasses regulatory agencies.\n\nThe major explanation for the epidemic proportions achieved by laetrile, it seems to me, lies in the shrewdness with which its proponents have recog\u00adnized these factors I have been discussing in the cultural environment and the skill with which they have exploited them. Misused authority constitutes oppression, and the opposite of oppression is freedom. If, in these parlous times, you can sell a panicked cancer sufferer and his family on the concept, not only that you have a treatment that will do some good, but also, that in accepting the treatment they are taking, in a confused immoral world, a nobly moral stand for an ancient and patriotic virtue, are joining a crusade for freedom itself, If you can do this, I say you are in business. The pitch may even seem persuasive to state legislators and federal judges.\n\nA radical right-wing reaction to our time of troubles, a movement opposing the initiatives of modern government, seems to be. a growing phenomenon. The adherence of such true believers to the ranks of laetrile promoters has unquestionably helped the movement grow. Some leaders of the Committee for Freedom of Choice in Cancer Therapy may have profited from the marketing of laetrile as part of their motivation, but there exists unquestionably a massive component of the zeal of the doctrinaire. Frank Salaman, one of the founders of the group, sees \u201cat stake\u201d a \u201cstrong principle of human freedom from uncon\u00adstitutional interference.\u201d And the pro-laetrile film strip \u201cWorld without Cancer\u201d opened with the deceptively disarming words, \u201cWe are not prescribing any course of treatment. We endorse nothing but freedom of choice.\u201d\n\nFreedom of access to worthless cancer treatments, as I wrote in my affi\u00addavit submitted to the rulemaking proceeding, \u201cleads only [backward] toward the license of those ancient days, when \u2018the toadstool millionaires,\u2019 preaching religion and spouting patriotism, operating without restraint, fleeced and often killed their gullible victims. That is a fate from which seven decades of constructive legislation, beginning . . . [in] 1906, has somewhat rescued the nation. Complex, modern, industrial, urbanized society, with standards of medical judgment far more precise than those existing in the 19th century, cannot afford to let the nation\u2019s health be governed by a distorted definition of that great symbol, \u2018freedom,\u2019 which would return piratical anarchy to the realm of health.\u201d Legalizing laetrile, I fear, would breach the dike of the new drug efficacy provisions of the 1962 law in a most ominous way.\n\nAn additional major force lofting laetrile to epidemic proportions, it seems to me, is another kind of alliance formed by its promoters. I don\u2019t know how firm structural links may be, but in developing political action procedures laetrile\u2019s champions have sat at the feet of the health food lobby. And, of course, whatever its earlier purported modes of biochemical functioning, laetrile finally became\u00b7 transmuted into a vitamin. In testifying last July before Senator Kennedy\u2019s Subcommittee on Health, Ernst Krebs, Jr. called laetrile \u201ca scientific revolution as profound as the germ theory of disease . . . [and] the Copernican theory.\u201d What Vitamin C is to scurvy, niacin to pellagra, and Vitamin D to rickets, he suggested, Vitamin B-17 is to cancer. If every American took laetrile regularly, Dr. John Richardson told the same hearing,\u201d in 20 years cancer would be relegated to the dusty pages of history.\u201d\n\nConverting laetrile into a vitamin must have seemed like a master stroke. Not only would it put the product under the food rather than the drug provisions of the national law, it would also broaden the market by giving a more plausible explanation for preventive therapy. Moreover, in light of folk attitudes, it would wrap the product in a glamorous cloak. For the word \u201cvitamin,\u201d for reasons both sound and illegitimate, holds high esteem. The survey of health practices and opinions, already referred to, revealed that three out of four .Americans cherish the magical belief that, no matter how sufficient their diets, taking extra vitamins automatically provides more energy and pep. This myth of superhealth from vitamins stands ready to piggyback other health claims.\n\nThe survey revealed another telling point. Whereas in most aspects of self-treatment, no coherent body of theory underlies consumer action, which is motivated by what the study called \u201crampant empiricism,\u201d in the vitamin and health food area a different set of circumstances prevails. Here alone something like an organized rationale underlies conduct, one based on the premise that the normal food supply, because of inadequacies and introduced poisons, threatens health rather than promoting it, requiring supplements to save the day. This myth has been the deliberate and successful creation of the health food industry, especially since enactment of the 1938 law, fabri\u00adcated out of food folklore running back to the dawn age of man, of clever leger\u00addemain involving complex scientific nutrition, and of some true and scary episodes relating to standard foods. Linking in to the power of this myth could only aid in laetrile\u2019s popular acceptance.\n\nThe health food leaders have excelled at employing the modern mass media to disseminate their nutritional fairy tales. \u201cIn effect,\u201d as Stephen Barrett has put it, \u201cthe media have become the label,\u201d but a label so detached from the packaging as seldom to be actionable. Promoters of dubious nutritional wares have also proved to be amazingly skillful at mobilizing those whom they had converted into a powerful political force. The Vitamin Amendments of 1976 attest to this skill. In their efforts to thwart the FDA\u2019s regulatory goals, even to reduce the agency\u2019s statutory power, the health food industry pioneered in waving the flag of freedom against bureaucratic oppression. Their literature appealed to Washington and Lincoln, asserting \u201cThey Too Fought for Freedom Against Great Odds. \u201cSurely these vitamin freedom shouters furnished an example in doctrine for those proclaiming the riskier freedom of treating cancer with the specious vitamin B-17. Pseudo-nutritionists have also shown laetrile leaders how to turn converts to their therapeutic doctrines into political shock troops.\n\nEvidences exist of cooperative interaction between the National Health Federation, one of the health food industry\u2019s major pressure groups, and laetrile\u2019s supporters. At NHF conventions, pro-laetrile movies have been shown. An NHF governor has edited pamphlets espousing laetrile, and the president of one of the laetrile sponsoring organizations, the Cancer Control Council, has served on the NHF governing board. The NHF Bulletin has boosted laetrile. So it is not surprising that their respective patterns of drum beating, in\u00adcluding political lobbying, should resemble each other.\n\nIn a democracy, of course, representative bodies chosen by the electorate make the rules, including those relating to highly complex scientific matters. I am an admirer of William Lowrance\u2019s book entitled Of Acceptable Risk, Science and the Determination of Safety, the result of an inquiry by the Committee on Science and Public Policy of the National Academy of Sciences. In essence, he concludes that in making public policy regarding matters of potential danger to society, the assessment of hazard is a scientific decision made by the experts, whereas the determination of risk is a political decision made by elected officials. Public opinion supported the enactment of food and drug laws, and those laws sought to remove from day-in, day-out legislative deter\u00admination highly complex particular questions, giving such decisions to expert agencies with rules of procedure defined in the laws. For legislatures to abandon this established tradition and rule on issues ad hoc seems to me highly unwise social policy, although of course legislatures possess the inherent power to do so. It is an indication of the epidemic levels of nutritional and cancer quackery that, in the federal and state areas respectively, enough pressure has been generated to cut back on the established pattern as well as on the rigor of regulation.\n\nSometimes, in short, when shrewdly propagandized, a major segment of public opinion can be led to support a stand contrary to the conclusions of reputable scientists. And the issue may become emotional enough to make an impact on legislative bodies. \u201cCongress will rely on science when it can,\u201d the counsel for the House Health Subcommittee said recently, but in order for scientists to persuade legislators, they must convince the American people.\n\nThis means a battle for minds, and for wills too, the will to let legis\u00adlators know convictions held. Champions of the unorthodox, for reasons I have sought to explain, bubble over with aggressive zeal. Opponents of the unorthodox on scientific grounds often act with greater diffidence. And when they do act, to many people they only confirm the distrust in which they already are held. Medical societies have not waged such effective battles against quackery recently as earlier in the century; indeed, the American Medical Association disbanded its anti-quackery machinery. Few local groups have demonstrated the vigor and imagination of Stephen Barrett\u2019s Lehigh Valley Committee Against Health Fraud, among whose anti-quackery ventures the preparation of an excellent book, The Health Robbers, aimed at a broad readership, ranks high in public service. The American Cancer Society has striven to alert the public to the dangers of unproven methods.\n\nWith respect to laetrile, the Food and Drug Administration has assumed the role of primary educator to the nation, in connection with the agency\u2019s legal actions and in a more general sense as well. In testimony before legislative committees, press releases, the pages of FDA Consumer, legal briefs, and a widely distributed poster, the FDA has striven to alert the public to laetrile\u2019s dangers. In the perspective of history, I trust the agency will receive for this service the credit it deserves. In light of what I have said earlier about our intellectual environment, I believe all foes of quackery have reason to remain alert.\n\nA recent student of Elisha Perkins\u2019 career, Jacques Quen, points to the fact that Perkins\u2019 physician critics, in condemning him, did not pose for themselves a further question. Why did the metallic tractors evoke such a satisfied, indeed ecstatic response from those who used them for their pains? Now, 180 years later, a much better understanding prevails of the placebo effect. And the Commissioner\u2019s report contains some intriguing efforts to explain the motivation of laetrile\u2019s users and proselytizers. Yet do we know enough? Is this not a field requiring more research? Would there not be value in seeking to balance Dr. Richardson\u2019s Laetrile Case Histories with another set, revealing not only the physiological circumstances, but as fully as might be, the psychological parameters of laetrile users, not only including the disillusioned, but the most buoyant of champions? Difficult as this task might be, I believe the results might prove to be useful on both the educational and the regulatory fronts against threats from other quackery epidemics in the years ahead.\n\nJames Harvey Young (1915-2006), a professor of history at Emory University, was a social historian whose special interest was the development of food and drug regulation in America.

        "Krisztian Magori reviews a recent study demonstrating that flaviviruses make mice (and people) produce more of the volatile acetophenone, which is also included in many perfumes, that attracts more blood-seeking female mosquitoes; and that a cheap and safe vitamin A derivative might be able to counter their effects.\n\nhttps://www.publicdomainpictures.net/en/view-image.php?image=399690&picture=woman-perfume-vintage-art-print\n\nDengue, Zika, and other flaviviruses transmitted by mosquitoes in the Aedes genera are a major public health issue, making hundreds of millions of people sick and killing tens of thousands of people every year. These arboviruses are expected to transmit better and to more people geographically in the future in our warming climate. For millennia, people have recognized that during mosquito-borne disease outbreaks, patients with those diseases need to be protected from further mosquito bites (by e.g. with bednets) during their convalescence in order to limit the spread of these diseases to healthy people. The rationale for this partly is that convalescent patients might be less able to protect themselves from mosquito bites due to their symptoms, and partly because mosquitoes might be more attracted to people sick with mosquito-borne diseases. Such a strategy would be evolutionarily advantageous to mosquito-borne pathogens to maximize their transmission. There is some evidence for increased attractiveness of people infectious with mosquito-borne diseases to blood-seeking female mosquitoes, via manipulating their host. For example, we know that Plasmodium parasites produce an isoprenoid precursor that increases the release of volatile blends by human red blood cells which make malaria-infected mice significantly more attractive to Anopheles mosquito vectors. However, up to now, we didn\u2019t know if arboviruses, transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes would similarly manipulate their host to maximize disease transmission.\n\nIn a tour-de-force of a study, Hong Zhang, Yibin Zhu and their colleagues at Tsinghua University demonstrated that flavivirus infected mice were significantly more attractive for blood-seeking Aedes mosquitoes. Mosquitoes were allowed to select to move to cages closer to healthy or infected mice in a three-cage as well as in a two-cage olfactometer. The preference of the mosquitoes was related to volatiles emitted by the hosts, shown by the preference being eliminated by volatile removal.\n\nAnalyzing how the antennae of female mosquitoes reacted to the volatiles of healthy and infected mice, the researchers found that mosquitoes responded significantly to acetophenone, decanal and styrene, but not to other volatiles. Acetophenone attracted more mosquitoes when put on healthy mice, or on a human hand, compared with just the solvent. Using GC-MS, ten-to-hundred times as much acetophenone was found to be released by Zika-virus and dengue-infected compared to healthy mice.\n\nVolatiles taken from the armpits of dengue patients attracted significantly more mosquitoes than just the solvent, or volatiles taken from the armpits of healthy donors. The volatiles taken from the armpits of dengue patients also contained ten-to-hundred times as much acetophenone compared to the volatiles taken from armpits of healthy donors.\n\nWhen the skin bacteria of mice infected with Zika or dengue virus were removed, the preference of mosquitoes for infected mice was eliminated, but not when the gut bacteria was removed, indicating that acetophenone release is connected to skin bacteria on mice. Acetophenone release also reduced to a level similar to that of healthy mice when the skin bacteria of flavivirus-infected mice was removed, but not when their gut bacteria was removed.\n\nDengue and ZIKV-infected mice had ten times as much bacteria, with increased relative abundance of Bacillus and Staphylococcus, but reduced relative abundance of Lactobacillus, compared to healthy mice. Bacillus bacteria produced large amounts of acetophenone when cultured on the skin of germ-free mice, and elicited increased attraction of blood-seeking female mosquitoes in the olfactometer at large enough concentrations.\n\nResistin-like molecula-\u03b1, an antimicrobial protein specifically expressed by epidermal keratinocytes and sebocytes was expressed at significantly reduced levels in the skin of Zika-virus and dengue-infected mice, compared to healthy controls, based on RNA-seq, qPCR and Western blot. This protein, as well as it\u2019s human analog, RETN, significantly reduced the viability of the acetophenone-producing Bacillus bacteria, compared to other bacteria. Based on previous research, RELM-\u03b1 can be induced by dietary vitamin A derivatives, such as isotretinoin.\n\nRELM-alpha production was restored to healthy levels in Zika-virus and dengue-infected mice that were administered isotretinoin through oral gavage, and relative abundance of Bacillus bacteria on the skin of these mice was also not significantly different from healthy mice. In addition, female blood-seeking mosquitoes were not preferentially attracted to the mice administered isotretinoin, despite their Zika-virus and dengue infection. About half as many mosquitoes were infected among mosquitoes allowed to feed on dengue-virus and Zika-virus infected mice when they were administered isotrenioin, while their Zika virus titers were not significantly different.\n\nIn summary, the authors found that Zika and dengue viruses suppress the production of RELM-alpha, allowing the proliferation of Bacillus bacteria, thereby increasing the production of acetophenone, which acts as a potent attract for blood-seeking mosquitoes. In addition, this process can be obstructed by the administration of isotretinoin, increasing RELM-alpha, reducing Bacillus bacteria, and acetophenone production.\n\nOne of the strengths of this study is that it provides a thorough analysis of this important subject, and it combines a large number of studies employing a variety of techniques from mosquito choice assays to electroantennograms to GS-MS to RNA-seq to microbiological studies in the quest to find the mechanism by which mosquitoes prefer infected mice and people. The study provides strong evidence that flaviviruses modify their host\u2019s microbiome to increase the production of volatiles that attract mosquito vectors, ensuring their transmission to other hosts. This is similar to how Plasmodium parasites increase the release of volatile blends by human red blood cells to attract more Anopheles mosquitoes. There are also similar examples from insect-transmitted plant pathogens, such as where the Cucumber Mosaic Virus makes infected squash plants produce a volatile blend that attracts aphids despite the low quality of the infected plant. These results suggest that we have a whole another reason to protect people infected with flaviviruses from mosquito bites, because even with all else equal, they will attract more mosquitoes.\n\nAnother exciting part of this study was the demonstration that a dietary vitamin A derivative, isotretinoin, was able reverse the attractiveness of infected animals, with only about half of the mosquitoes feeding on the host getting infected. This is particularly exciting because it suggests that in addition to protecting convalescent people from mosquitoes with screens and bednets, we can counter their increased attractiveness to mosquitoes using a low-cost, easily administered, safe drug. Isotretinoin is already used for treating acne under the brand name Accutane, so it could just be repurposed for this new indication, which would be much easier and quicker to license compared to a completely new drug. However, we need to remember that this study was conducted primarily on mice, with the exception of taking volatiles from people\u2019s armpits and testing compounds on their hands. A possible next step might be to conduct a double-blind randomized study with dengue or Zika patients to see if administering isotretinoin orally would also increase RETN production in their skin, reduce Bacillus relative abundance and acetophenone production, and ultimately their attractiveness to female blood-seeking mosquitoes. If the results remain comparable in human studies, we could cut down the number of mosquitoes picking up Zika or dengue viruses from infected people by half, significantly contributing to the control of these flaviviruses.\n\nFinally, the volatile responsible in the current study for increased attractiveness of infected mice, acetophenone, is widely used in fragrances and perfumes, due to its floral, sweet scent to people. Thus, next time you go to areas that are endemic for dengue, Zika, or other flaviviruses, or just have large Aedes populations (such as Eastern North America), which will increase in the future, make sure to check that the fragrance you\u2019re wearing does not include acetophenone!",
        "Around the world, physicians at overwhelmed hospitals may have to decide who will not get treated during the pandemic.\n\nJoel Shurkin, Contributor\n\n(Inside Science) -- For almost a month, Lombardy, the prosperous, mountainous section of northern Italy, has been the world\u2019s hotspot for COVID-19, the severe respiratory pandemic now raging in cities like New York and around the globe.\n\nThe Italians were unprepared. So is the U.S.\n\nItaly\u2019s excellent universal health care system is now in danger of crashing. Doctors there are facing stunning existential decisions: Who will they treat, and who will they let die? Hospital capacity is overwhelmed and medical staff are falling ill from the virus. They simply can\u2019t treat everyone.\n\nIn a pandemic, the standard rules of medicine no longer apply, and health care providers in the U.S., including those in Detroit and New York, either are now facing or may soon face the same conundrum.\n\nThe pandemic hit Italy quietly. On Jan. 30, a Chinese couple from Wuhan were admitted to a hospital in Rome that specializes in infectious diseases. The authorities identified the disease and quickly acted to ban any flights from Wuhan to Italy.\n\nItalians in Wuhan were repatriated home and a few of them were also found to have the virus. Not much was made of the finding because the original site of contracting the virus was easily identified.\n\nAbout three weeks later, Giulio Gallera, Councilor for Welfare in Lombardy, announced that Mattia, a 38-year-old Italian from the region had been hospitalized for pneumonia and tested positive for the coronavirus. He had not been to China or in contact with anyone who had. The virus was loose in the region.\n\nAs of March 27, the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center reported that Italy had recorded 86,498 cases of COVID-19 infection and that 9,134 people had died.\n\nIn mid-March, Italy had approximately 6,000 intensive care beds, a number reached in part by switching regular hospital rooms to ICU rooms and hospital beds to ICU beds, a process that takes several hours and sometimes days. The country aims to increase ICU capacity to 9,000 beds. Many more people may need hospitalization in Lombardy alone.\n\nVentilators are crucial to saving desperately ill patients. Doctors use these mechanical breathing machines when a patient is unable to breathe enough on their own. When a ventilator is removed from a patient who has not recovered, the patient can suffocate. At some hospitals, staff are attempting to alter other devices to make more respirators, such as repurposing SCUBA masks and adapting tubing to use one ventilator for more than one person, among other techniques.\n\nIn one of the first large-scale studies of the characteristics of the coronavirus in Wuhan, 5% of patients required the intensive care unit, and 2.3% required ventilation. When the number of patients who need care exceeds the capacity of the health care system to provide that care at the medically advisable level, the only immediate solution is rationing.\n\nFifty years ago, doctors in the U.S. could be charged with crimes for rationing health care, said Thomas Raffin, former associate director of the intensive care unit at Stanford University hospital and a bioethicist. It was considered murder or manslaughter. Treating everyone equally was a matter of law and ethics. Even when survival chances were uncertain, the ethical and legal mandate was to continue treatment.\n\nThe use of the word triage (a French word) in medical contexts comes from the military in the 19th and early 20th centuries. During wartime, injured solders brought into a hospital were quickly categorized into three groups: the ones who obviously could be saved, the ones who had 50-50 odds, and those who probably couldn\u2019t be saved. The first group got immediate treatment, said Raffin. The third category was left to die.\n\nTriage for patients admitted to hospitals is typically necessary only when medical resources are limited.\n\nWhat the Italian doctors describe is a lowering of standards, said Maurizio Cereda, professor of critical care at the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. If the hospital is short on resources, it is entirely possible that someone brought in with a heart attack or appendicitis may not receive treatment or may not be treated as well as they otherwise would. The same thing can happen with COVID-19 patients. Cereda said it is happening now in Italy, where heart attack patients sometimes die for lack of attention.\n\n\u201cThey are not able to be rescued because of a lack of equipment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s horrible. It\u2019s horrible,\u201d Cereda said. \u201cThey [the Italian doctors] will carry those scars forever.\u201d\n\nOne way to ease the ethical problem for physicians is to use committees to make the decisions, taking the burden off individual doctors. In Italy, a set of rules newly formulated by the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) gives external support for the decision. Physicians can then follow the guidelines.\n\nThe allocation criteria need to guarantee that those patients with the highest chance of therapeutic success will retain access to intensive care, the guidelines say. They then set an age limit, though it\u2019s not a hard and fast rule -- the physical condition of the patient would factor into it -- and came up with the age of 70. Patients over 70 could be unlikely to pass selection when the demand for ICU beds is too high. Hospitals would center their treatment on those patients who would live longest. This may sound cruel, but the alternative, the document argues, is no better.\n\nIn American hospitals that become stressed, similar rules or guidelines will likely apply. If there is a 25-year-old cancer patient and a 60-year-old in good health, the hospital might choose the 60-year-old, said Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at the Grossman School of Medicine at New York University.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s not just age, but age usually correlates with the likelihood of benefit.\u201d said Caplan.\n\nResearchers at Harvard and Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, in an article in the New England Journal of Medicine, wrote that \u201cthe angst that clinicians experience when asked to withdraw ventilators for reasons not related to the welfare of their patients, should not be underestimated -- it may lead to debilitating and disabling distress for some clinicians.\u201d They suggest a committee make the decision.\n\nWho is going to tell the family? The Italian guidelines suggest that be done by volunteers or members of a triage committee and not the attending physician.\n\nThese kinds of rationing approaches have rarely been seen in the U.S. since 1918 when a flu pandemic killed about 50 million people around the world.\n\nYet as COVID-19 cases continue to soar, American hospitals are staring in the face of impending shortages of equipment and personnel. American doctors will likely face the same agonizing choices that have been necessary in other countries facing the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a lot of educational webinars with residents, medical students, staff, ICU directors,\u201d said Caplan. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going on everywhere around the country. I know many hospitals are scrambling to put together policies and committees. I think we're a little ahead of the game at NYU, partly because we\u2019re a hospital of last resort.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any hospital is fully prepared. I think planning was just inadequate.\u201d\n\nSpain is now catching up to Italy with cases. \u201cAnd so,\" Cereda said, \u201care we.\u201d",
        "A vaccine could confer long-term protection even if a natural infection does not.\n\nNala Rogers, Staff Writer\n\n(Inside Science) -- COVID-19 vaccines could provide stronger, longer-lasting immunity than recovering from the disease itself, say experts.\n\nMost people who recover from COVID-19 probably enjoy some degree of protection against getting the disease again. Both the strength of that protection and how long it lasts remain open questions, with the answers complicated by a mixture of conflicting evidence. Some studies suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 may interfere with immune memory, leaving people vulnerable to repeat infections months or years later.\n\nBut even if that's true, there is no reason to think vaccines, once approved and available, would suffer from the same limitations.\n\n\"We're thinking that with the vaccines, we should be able to do better than nature,\" said Peter Doherty, a Nobel Prize-winning immunologist at the University of Melbourne's Doherty Institute in Australia.\n\nMore COVID-19 reporting from Inside Science\n\nHow Nobel-Winning Research is Helping Battle Covid-19\n\nFighting Misinformation About a Novel Disease\n\nDisgust Evolved To Protect Us From Disease. Is It Working?\n\nHow the immune system remembers COVID-19\n\nThere are several ways the immune system can \"remember\" a virus after an infection has been vanquished. One involves B cells, which produce the virus-busting structures known as antibodies. Some B cells continue to produce antibodies even after an infection clears, while others linger in a dormant state until they are reactivated. Another type of immune memory involves killer T cells, which attack human cells that have been infected and turned into virus factories. Killer T cells reach their highest concentrations during infection, but a small population may remain for decades, ready to launch a faster response next time.\n\nNew research that is not yet peer reviewed indicates B cell and T cell immunity may remain strong six months after infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But it's not clear how much longer that protection will last, and there are other studies suggesting that both types of immune memory may be impaired by the disease.\n\n\"What this virus is doing is in some way compromising aspects of our immune response,\" said Doherty. \"We do think long-term immunity following infection is problematic.\"\n\nIn a study published last month in the journal Cell, researchers examined the lymph nodes of people who had died of COVID-19 and found they lacked structures called germinal centers. Germinal centers are where B cells mature into long-lived forms that produce better antibodies -- antibodies customized to bind strongly to a specific enemy. The process is similar to Darwinian natural selection, with B cells going through repeated rounds of genetic mutation. Mutated B cells that produce better antibodies are sent back to mutate again; B cells that produce worse antibodies die.\n\nImage Lymph nodes from a person with COVID-19 (upper right) and a non-infected person (lower left). The yellow parts in the non-infected person's lymph nodes are germinal centers. In the infected patient's lymph nodes, germinal centers are largely absent. Media credits Shiv Pillai and Naoki Kaneko Media rights This image may only be reproduced with this Inside Science article.\n\nWhile the body can produce effective B cells without germinal centers, those B cells tend not to last as long as ones that have been through the germinal center process, said Shiv Pillai, director of the Immunology Graduate Program at Harvard Medical School, who conducted the study with his colleagues. If COVID-19 prevents people from forming germinal centers, said Pillai, that could mean people can only produce antibodies for a limited time after infection.\n\nThe researchers could only examine lymph nodes from deceased people, so the germinal center problem might only crop up when illness is severe, noted Godelieve de Bree, an internist and infectious disease specialist at Amsterdam University Medical Centers in the Netherlands, who is studying COVID-19 antibodies. Immunologist Michel Nussenzweig at Rockefeller University in New York agreed, saying that findings from deceased patients do not necessarily indicate anything about people who recover.\n\n\"I think you see a problem with everything in people [who] are dying,\" said Nussenzweig.\n\nFurther evidence leads to conflicting interpretations. Pillai noted that antibodies collected from COVID-19 patients during and soon after infection have few of the telltale mutations that would indicate they have been through germinal centers. That's true regardless of the severity of illness, suggesting that immune memory from B cells may be limited even in mild and moderate cases, according to Pillai. But Nussenzweig's team recently found evidence that mutation levels are higher six months after infection, suggesting that long-lived B cells may develop gradually after people are well.\n\nThere are also hints that killer T cells may be impaired by COVID-19. In a study published in September in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers led by Katherine Kedzierska at the Doherty Institute found that killer T cell counts in COVID-19 patients didn't rise nearly as much as the researchers expected, and there was no sign that any remained after recovery to provide immune memory. Even at the height of infection, there were only a tenth as many killer T cells for the COVID-19 virus as a typical person has left over from influenza A infections sometime in the past.\n\n\"The killer T cell system in this virus seems to be compromised. It's not as good as it should be,\" said Doherty, who also took part in the study. He added that the study only looked at one of several types of killer T cells involved in COVID-19, and more research is needed.\n\nSo how long can people who recover from COVID-19 expect to be protected? It's still unclear, and opinions are divided. Pillai suspects most COVID-19 patients will lose any protection they gained from B cells and antibodies within a year of recovery, and potentially sooner. De Bree thinks immunity may last around a year, as that's how long it lasts in other coronaviruses that cause seasonal colds.\n\nIt's now clear that reinfections can happen. As of Nov. 11, there are 421 suspected and 25 confirmed cases of people being infected twice, according to a tracker maintained by the Dutch news organization BNO News. In most cases, the second illness has been mild or asymptomatic, but one man in Nevada came down with severe COVID-19 barely more than a month after recovering from a milder version.\n\nNussenzweig noted that those reinfection numbers are low, considering the millions of people who have been infected. But with the pandemic less than a year old, it is still early days.\n\n\"I think it would be very important not to depend on getting immunity from being infected,\" said Pillai.\n\nWhy a vaccine could be better than nature\n\nIf it turns out that COVID-19 does leave people vulnerable after recovery, why should researchers expect a vaccine to provide longer-lasting protection?\n\nA few decades ago, they might not have. For diseases like measles, mumps and hepatitis B, all a vaccine has to do is mimic nature, since people naturally develop lifelong immunity after infection. But many viruses avoid or manipulate the immune system in ways that leave people open to repeat infections. Modern vaccine development aims to correct for such problems.\n\n\"Our goal in this case is to definitely do better than natural immunity,\" said Barney Graham, deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Graham helped isolate and stabilize the viral spike protein that is being used in many COVID-19 vaccine candidates, including the vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech that made headlines on Monday after the companies announced promising early results from a clinical trial. Graham's team is now collaborating with the biotechnology company Moderna on another COVID-19 vaccine candidate.\n\nOne example of a vaccine that typically provides better immunity than a natural infection is the HPV vaccine, which protects against strains of human papillomavirus that cause cervical cancer. HPV spends most of its time hiding inside cells of the skin and the lining of the cervix without doing anything to draw the attention of the immune system, said Richard Schlegel, a virologist and pathologist at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, who helped develop the vaccine in the 2000s.\n\nIn contrast, vaccination involves injecting viral proteins directly into the muscle, and from there the proteins spread throughout the body -- a challenge the immune system can't ignore. Afterward, the trained immune cells can recognize HPV proteins wherever they crop up, even in the tiny quantities produced by natural infections.\n\nCOVID-19 presents a different set of challenges, including the possibility that the virus may be thwarting aspects of the immune system\u2019s memory. A vaccine may be able to get around this, researchers say.\n\nMany of the vaccine candidates don\u2019t use the whole virus, delivering instead a single viral protein or protein fragment to stimulate the immune system. Some vaccines deliver the protein directly, while others deliver a gene that induces the body to produce the protein in its own cells. Researchers might not understand exactly how SARS-CoV-2 manipulates the immune system, but it likely takes more than a single protein.\n\n\"We're taking away all those other viral genes that are probably screwing up the immune response,\" said Doherty.\n\nMany vaccines also include substances called adjuvants that enhance the immune response and guide it in certain directions, said Graham. And in some cases, vaccines can be delivered in multiple doses to further boost their effects.\n\nEven with such advantages, a COVID-19 vaccine probably won't make people completely immune for the rest of their lives. Graham expects vaccinated people will still be susceptible to infection, but will fight off such infections quickly, hopefully before feeling sick. Some people will probably still transmit the virus to others, but not as often. People may also need yearly booster shots.\n\nThat may not sound like the magic bullet some people are hoping for. But if a vaccine can be proven safe and effective and made widely available, it could offer a path forward, out of a crisis that is still crippling economies and killing thousands of people around the world each day.\n\n\"Everything is telling us, if you want to be protected, whether you got infected or not -- please, get vaccinated,\" said Pillai.",
        "The unprecedented pace of scientific progress on Covid-19 builds on groundbreaking discoveries from the past.\n\nA German caricature showing Emil von Behring extracting diphtheria antitoxin from a horse through a tap. Von Behring won the very first Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for his work on diphtheria antitoxin in 1901.\n\nNala Rogers, Staff Writer\n\n(Inside Science) -- Today's Covid-19 researchers didn't start from scratch. Their rapid progress in understanding a disease that was unknown one year ago rests on over a century's worth of discoveries about viruses and the immune system.\n\nNext week, scientists in Sweden will announce new Nobel Prize winners in physiology or medicine. This year's winners will join an inspirational group whose work continues to shape science and society. Here's how some of those past Nobel-winning discoveries are contributing to the fight against the current pandemic.\n\nDiscovering antibodies\n\nEmil von Behring won the very first Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1901 for his work on diphtheria, which killed so many children in the 19th century that it was called the \"strangling angel of children.\" Through a series of experiments on animals such as guinea pigs, von Behring found that individuals that had recovered from diphtheria held a miraculous cure in their blood. When he processed the blood to remove larger components like cells, the resulting serum could prevent other animals from contracting the disease and even cure ones that had been exposed to diphtheria toxin.\n\nVon Behring and his colleagues developed anti-diphtheria serum into a medicine that could be produced in large quantities in horses and used to save children's lives. His key collaborator Paul Ehrlich standardized the serum to ensure each dose had the same potency. Ehrlich also developed theoretical explanations for how it all worked. While Ehrlich was wrong about certain details, he correctly laid out the core of antibody-mediated immunity: Infection prompts cells to release defensive substances, or antibodies, which can destroy the particular pathogen or toxin that spurred their production.\n\n\"He made a science of it,\" said Arthur Silverstein, a retired immunologist who is now affiliated with the Department of the History of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. \"He really defined in better scientific terms what an antibody was and where it came from and how it worked.\" Ehrlich was awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1908.\n\nImage Paul Ehrlich working in his laboratory.

The main difference is that diphtheria antitoxin came from nonhuman animals, while convalescent plasma comes from humans.\n\n\"The logic is, 'that person recovered. They've got antibodies in them. I'm going to go get them,'\" said Timothy Block, president and CEO of the Hepatitis B Foundation and its Baruch S. Blumberg Institute, a nonprofit medical research organization.\n\nWhile diphtheria antitoxin was highly effective, the evidence that convalescent plasma helps against Covid-19 is mixed. Block believes it likely helps a subset of patients at certain disease stages, but it's not yet clear how to predict who will benefit from it. That's because Covid-19 is more complicated than diphtheria.\n\nDiphtheria is caused by a bacterium called Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and its harmful effects can be traced to a single toxin easily neutralized by antibodies. Covid-19 is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, which takes over human cells and wreaks havoc through multiple mechanisms that researchers are still struggling to understand.\n\nAfter developing diphtheria antitoxin, von Behring invented a vaccine by mixing diphtheria toxin and antitoxin together. The antitoxin neutralized the toxin and rendered it safe, and people's immune systems responded to the deactivated toxin by producing their own antibodies.\n\nVon Behring's mixture wasn't the first vaccine ever developed -- the smallpox vaccine had already been around for more than a century. But at that time, no one knew how the smallpox vaccine worked. Von Behring's approach was \"the start of rational vaccine design,\" said Stefan Kaufmann, an immunologist and infection biologist and founding director of the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Germany. Prompting patients' bodies to produce antibodies is still a primary goal of vaccine developers today, including those working on vaccines for Covid-19.\n\nAntibodies as tools\n\nAntibodies are also valuable as detection tools. A single type of antibody will only bind to a specific chemical target, and scientists can design antibodies to target almost any biological substance they want to study. Researchers use antibodies for everything from staining parts of cells on microscope slides to testing for diseases. Indeed, some Covid-19 screening tests use antibodies to detect whether a person has SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in their body.\n\nBut many tests and experiments require pure samples containing only one type of antibody. A person's blood contains thousands of types of antibodies. Even a single disease can prompt the body to produce many types of antibodies, as each recognizes a different part of the disease-causing organism or its products.\n\nC\u00e9sar Milstein and Georges K\u00f6hler solved this problem in 1975. By that time, scientists knew that antibodies are produced by specialized cells called B cells, and each B cell makes only one type of antibody. But B cells don't survive long outside the body. To make antibody-producing cell cultures that could be grown in the lab and kept alive indefinitely, K\u00f6hler and Milstein fused B cells with cancer cells. The resulting \"hybridomas\" each produced a single type of antibody, or \"monoclonal antibody.\" The advance won them the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1984.\n\n\"It has totally revolutionized biology,\" said Pamela Bj\u00f6rkman, a structural immunologist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. \"We use monoclonal antibodies -- we and everyone else these days.\" (There are now several ways of making monoclonal antibodies, although the K\u00f6hler and Milstein method is still widely used.)\n\nMany new drugs are actually monoclonal antibodies. For example, the anti-arthritis drug Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that reduces inflammation by suppressing parts of the immune system. Some of the worst damage in Covid-19 is caused by out-of-control immune reactions called cytokine storms, and researchers are investigating whether Tocilizumab can halt these destructive spirals.\n\nResearchers are also developing monoclonal antibodies that attack SARS-CoV-2 itself. Bj\u00f6rkman's team is working to characterize antibodies from convalescent plasma, hoping to identify promising candidates to synthesize as drugs. Multiple drugs identified that way, such as REGN-COV2 and LY-CoV-555, are already in clinical trials. According to Bj\u00f6rkman, the most effective antibody treatments will likely combine several types of monoclonal antibodies that attack the virus in different ways.\n\nKiller T cells\n\nWhile antibodies are hugely important, they can only kill viruses that are floating free in the blood. Once a virus has entered a human cell, it becomes invisible to antibodies -- but not to killer T cells.\n\nViruses take over the cells they infect, forcing them to churn out more viruses. Killer T cells attack these virus-infected cells. Like antibodies, killer T cells come in many varieties, each of which has its own specific target.\n\n\"The killer T cells are there to bump off damaged cells,\" said Peter Doherty, an immunologist at the University of Melbourne's Doherty Institute in Australia. \"They stop virus production -- kill the virus production factories.\"\n\nImage A microscope image showing a killer T cell (blue) attacking another cell. The cells are stained with fluorescent dyes that are bound to the cellular material using monoclonal antibodies. Media credits National Institutes of Health (NIH) via Flickr Media rights Public Domain Mark 1.0\n\nBy the early 1970s, researchers knew that killer T cells could destroy virus-infected cells. But they assumed T cells recognized infected cells in much the same way antibodies recognize viruses, perhaps by detecting newly produced viruses as they budded out from infected cells, said Doherty.\n\nWith colleagues including Rolf Zinkernagel, Doherty discovered that killer T cells rely on a group of molecules called MHC class 1 proteins that stick out from the surfaces of cells. Killer T cells bind to these MHC proteins and use them to assess whether a cell is a healthy part of a person's own body.\n\nWhen a virus infects a cell, it alters the MHC proteins on that cell's surface. These altered MHC proteins then serve as cries for help, telling killer T cells that the cell has gone rogue and should be destroyed. This discovery explained why transplanted organs are often rejected, since killer T cells may perceive MHC proteins from another individual as \"altered\" or \"foreign.\" Later work revealed that there is a second group of T cells, now known as helper T cells, that regulate the immune system rather than attacking infected cells.\n\nDoherty and Zinkernagel won a Nobel Prize for their work on MHC proteins and T cells, also called T lymphocytes, in 1996. Now, that knowledge is part of the fight against Covid-19.\n\n\"It is important to have good antibodies. But I doubt that they will be sufficient,\" said Kaufmann. \"Ultimately, to combat a disease like Covid-19, you also need T lymphocytes.\"\n\nMost vaccine developers still focus primarily on antibodies, according to Doherty. T cell responses take a few days to ramp up, whereas antibodies have the potential to destroy invading viruses quickly, preventing infection from ever taking place.\n\nBut respiratory viruses make challenging vaccine targets because it's hard to keep antibody levels high enough in the mucus that bathes the cells inside the nose, said Doherty. That's part of why flu vaccines are only about 40-60% effective at preventing illness. Researchers believe SARS-CoV-2 also starts out by infecting nasal tissues, so Doherty fears it could present some of the same problems.\n\nIf a Covid-19 vaccine were to stimulate a strong T cell response, it wouldn't prevent infection, but it could help people clear the infection quickly, with less severe symptoms.\n\nThere is no telling which of the many Covid-19 vaccine candidates will end up being most effective, said Doherty. But he thinks it\u2019s likely that the Moderna and Pfizer candidates, which use messenger RNA, will get especially good T cell responses.\n\nThere are many more Nobel-winning scientists whose work is important to Covid-19 research, and even more whose contributions were never honored with Nobels. Ultimately, they were all part of the same vast team, advancing human knowledge and empowering today's scientists to tackle the present threat.\n\n\"Almost everybody who has worked in the field has contributed a little bit to the progress,\" said Silverstein. \"This is the nature of the history of any science: It's as much involved in the people we don't remember as in the people we do.\"",
        "A vaccine could confer long-term protection even if a natural infection does not.\n\nNala Rogers, Staff Writer\n\n(Inside Science) -- COVID-19 vaccines could provide stronger, longer-lasting immunity than recovering from the disease itself, say experts.\n\nMost people who recover from COVID-19 probably enjoy some degree of protection against getting the disease again. Both the strength of that protection and how long it lasts remain open questions, with the answers complicated by a mixture of conflicting evidence. Some studies suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 may interfere with immune memory, leaving people vulnerable to repeat infections months or years later.\n\nBut even if that's true, there is no reason to think vaccines, once approved and available, would suffer from the same limitations.\n\n\"We're thinking that with the vaccines, we should be able to do better than nature,\" said Peter Doherty, a Nobel Prize-winning immunologist at the University of Melbourne's Doherty Institute in Australia.\n\nMore COVID-19 reporting from Inside Science\n\nHow Nobel-Winning Research is Helping Battle Covid-19\n\nFighting Misinformation About a Novel Disease\n\nDisgust Evolved To Protect Us From Disease. Is It Working?\n\nHow the immune system remembers COVID-19\n\nThere are several ways the immune system can \"remember\" a virus after an infection has been vanquished. One involves B cells, which produce the virus-busting structures known as antibodies. Some B cells continue to produce antibodies even after an infection clears, while others linger in a dormant state until they are reactivated. Another type of immune memory involves killer T cells, which attack human cells that have been infected and turned into virus factories. Killer T cells reach their highest concentrations during infection, but a small population may remain for decades, ready to launch a faster response next time.\n\nNew research that is not yet peer reviewed indicates B cell and T cell immunity may remain strong six months after infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But it's not clear how much longer that protection will last, and there are other studies suggesting that both types of immune memory may be impaired by the disease.\n\n\"What this virus is doing is in some way compromising aspects of our immune response,\" said Doherty. \"We do think long-term immunity following infection is problematic.\"\n\nIn a study published last month in the journal Cell, researchers examined the lymph nodes of people who had died of COVID-19 and found they lacked structures called germinal centers. Germinal centers are where B cells mature into long-lived forms that produce better antibodies -- antibodies customized to bind strongly to a specific enemy. The process is similar to Darwinian natural selection, with B cells going through repeated rounds of genetic mutation. Mutated B cells that produce better antibodies are sent back to mutate again; B cells that produce worse antibodies die.\n\nImage Lymph nodes from a person with COVID-19 (upper right) and a non-infected person (lower left). The yellow parts in the non-infected person's lymph nodes are germinal centers. In the infected patient's lymph nodes, germinal centers are largely absent. Media credits Shiv Pillai and Naoki Kaneko Media rights This image may only be reproduced with this Inside Science article.\n\nWhile the body can produce effective B cells without germinal centers, those B cells tend not to last as long as ones that have been through the germinal center process, said Shiv Pillai, director of the Immunology Graduate Program at Harvard Medical School, who conducted the study with his colleagues. If COVID-19 prevents people from forming germinal centers, said Pillai, that could mean people can only produce antibodies for a limited time after infection.\n\nThe researchers could only examine lymph nodes from deceased people, so the germinal center problem might only crop up when illness is severe, noted Godelieve de Bree, an internist and infectious disease specialist at Amsterdam University Medical Centers in the Netherlands, who is studying COVID-19 antibodies. Immunologist Michel Nussenzweig at Rockefeller University in New York agreed, saying that findings from deceased patients do not necessarily indicate anything about people who recover.\n\n\"I think you see a problem with everything in people [who] are dying,\" said Nussenzweig.\n\nFurther evidence leads to conflicting interpretations. Pillai noted that antibodies collected from COVID-19 patients during and soon after infection have few of the telltale mutations that would indicate they have been through germinal centers. That's true regardless of the severity of illness, suggesting that immune memory from B cells may be limited even in mild and moderate cases, according to Pillai. But Nussenzweig's team recently found evidence that mutation levels are higher six months after infection, suggesting that long-lived B cells may develop gradually after people are well.\n\nThere are also hints that killer T cells may be impaired by COVID-19. In a study published in September in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers led by Katherine Kedzierska at the Doherty Institute found that killer T cell counts in COVID-19 patients didn't rise nearly as much as the researchers expected, and there was no sign that any remained after recovery to provide immune memory. Even at the height of infection, there were only a tenth as many killer T cells for the COVID-19 virus as a typical person has left over from influenza A infections sometime in the past.\n\n\"The killer T cell system in this virus seems to be compromised. It's not as good as it should be,\" said Doherty, who also took part in the study. He added that the study only looked at one of several types of killer T cells involved in COVID-19, and more research is needed.\n\nSo how long can people who recover from COVID-19 expect to be protected? It's still unclear, and opinions are divided. Pillai suspects most COVID-19 patients will lose any protection they gained from B cells and antibodies within a year of recovery, and potentially sooner. De Bree thinks immunity may last around a year, as that's how long it lasts in other coronaviruses that cause seasonal colds.\n\nIt's now clear that reinfections can happen. As of Nov. 11, there are 421 suspected and 25 confirmed cases of people being infected twice, according to a tracker maintained by the Dutch news organization BNO News. In most cases, the second illness has been mild or asymptomatic, but one man in Nevada came down with severe COVID-19 barely more than a month after recovering from a milder version.\n\nNussenzweig noted that those reinfection numbers are low, considering the millions of people who have been infected. But with the pandemic less than a year old, it is still early days.\n\n\"I think it would be very important not to depend on getting immunity from being infected,\" said Pillai.\n\nWhy a vaccine could be better than nature\n\nIf it turns out that COVID-19 does leave people vulnerable after recovery, why should researchers expect a vaccine to provide longer-lasting protection?\n\nA few decades ago, they might not have. For diseases like measles, mumps and hepatitis B, all a vaccine has to do is mimic nature, since people naturally develop lifelong immunity after infection. But many viruses avoid or manipulate the immune system in ways that leave people open to repeat infections. Modern vaccine development aims to correct for such problems.\n\n\"Our goal in this case is to definitely do better than natural immunity,\" said Barney Graham, deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Graham helped isolate and stabilize the viral spike protein that is being used in many COVID-19 vaccine candidates, including the vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech that made headlines on Monday after the companies announced promising early results from a clinical trial. Graham's team is now collaborating with the biotechnology company Moderna on another COVID-19 vaccine candidate.\n\nOne example of a vaccine that typically provides better immunity than a natural infection is the HPV vaccine, which protects against strains of human papillomavirus that cause cervical cancer. HPV spends most of its time hiding inside cells of the skin and the lining of the cervix without doing anything to draw the attention of the immune system, said Richard Schlegel, a virologist and pathologist at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, who helped develop the vaccine in the 2000s.\n\nIn contrast, vaccination involves injecting viral proteins directly into the muscle, and from there the proteins spread throughout the body -- a challenge the immune system can't ignore. Afterward, the trained immune cells can recognize HPV proteins wherever they crop up, even in the tiny quantities produced by natural infections.\n\nCOVID-19 presents a different set of challenges, including the possibility that the virus may be thwarting aspects of the immune system\u2019s memory. A vaccine may be able to get around this, researchers say.\n\nMany of the vaccine candidates don\u2019t use the whole virus, delivering instead a single viral protein or protein fragment to stimulate the immune system. Some vaccines deliver the protein directly, while others deliver a gene that induces the body to produce the protein in its own cells. Researchers might not understand exactly how SARS-CoV-2 manipulates the immune system, but it likely takes more than a single protein.\n\n\"We're taking away all those other viral genes that are probably screwing up the immune response,\" said Doherty.\n\nMany vaccines also include substances called adjuvants that enhance the immune response and guide it in certain directions, said Graham. And in some cases, vaccines can be delivered in multiple doses to further boost their effects.\n\nEven with such advantages, a COVID-19 vaccine probably won't make people completely immune for the rest of their lives. Graham expects vaccinated people will still be susceptible to infection, but will fight off such infections quickly, hopefully before feeling sick. Some people will probably still transmit the virus to others, but not as often. People may also need yearly booster shots.\n\nThat may not sound like the magic bullet some people are hoping for. But if a vaccine can be proven safe and effective and made widely available, it could offer a path forward, out of a crisis that is still crippling economies and killing thousands of people around the world each day.\n\n\"Everything is telling us, if you want to be protected, whether you got infected or not -- please, get vaccinated,\" said Pillai.",
        "Key Points\n\nQuestion Is the COVID-19 pandemic associated with a decrease in the number of cancer screening tests globally?\n\nFindings In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 39 publications, the screening types analyzed were associated with a significant overall decrease (\u221246.7%, \u221244.9%, and \u221251.8% for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening, respectively) from January to October 2020. This decrease showed a U-shaped trend with a negative peak in April 2020 (\u221274.3% for mammography and \u221269.3% for colonoscopy and fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test) and in March 2020 for Papanicolaou test or human papillomavirus test (\u221278.8%).\n\nMeaning COVID-19 pandemic measures were associated with widely reduced cancer screening services, which was possibly associated with delayed cancer diagnosis and increased cancer mortality.\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance Public health services, including cancer screening tests, have been affected by the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic.\n\nObjective To investigate the pandemic\u2019s association with cancer screening worldwide.\n\nData Sources In this systematic review and meta-analysis, databases such as PubMed, ProQuest, and Scopus were searched comprehensively for articles published between January 1, 2020, and December 12, 2021.\n\nStudy Selection Observational studies and articles that reported data from cancer registries that compared the number of screening tests performed before and during the pandemic for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer were included.\n\nData Extraction and Synthesis Two pairs of independent reviewers extracted data from the selected studies. The weighted average of the percentage variation was calculated between the 2 periods to assess the change in the number of cancer screening tests performed during the pandemic. Stratified analysis was performed by geographic area, period, and type of setting. The systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was the weighted average percentage variation in the number of screening tests performed between January and October 2020 compared with the previous period.\n\nResults The review comprised 39 publications. There was an overall decrease of \u221246.7% (95% CI, \u221255.5% to \u221237.8%) for breast cancer screening, \u221244.9% (95% CI, \u221253.8% to \u221236.1%) for colorectal cancer screening, and \u221251.8% (95% CI, \u221264.7% to \u221238.9%) for cervical cancer screening during the pandemic. For all 3 cancers, a U-shaped temporal trend was identified; for colorectal cancer, a significant decrease was still apparent after May 2020 (in June to October, the decrease was \u221223.4% [95% CI, \u221244.4% to \u22122.4%]). Differences by geographic area and screening setting were also identified.\n\nConclusions and Relevance A summary estimate of the downscaling of cancer screening tests since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic is provided in this systematic review and meta-analysis. This could be associated with an increase in the number of avoidable cancer deaths. Effective interventions are required to restore the capacity of screening services to the prepandemic level.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn 2020, according to GLOBOCAN estimates, 19.3 million new cancer cases and approximately 10 million cancer deaths occurred owing to breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer, which are the first, third, and seventh most prevalent cancers worldwide, respectively.1 Screening programs help to detect cancer at early stages or precursor lesions, leading to decreased mortality.\n\nIn the past few years, especially in low- to medium-income countries,2 cancer screening and prevention protocols have had a remarkable impact on public health. However, major events, such as natural disasters and epidemics, can negatively affect screening rates and access to health care infrastructures and facilities,3 increasing the burden of cancer mortality.\n\nAt the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a suspension of many nonurgent medical services was imposed all over the world. Affected services concerned, for example, family planning and abortion4; HIV prevention, testing, and care5; cancer prevention; specialistic treatments such as delays or deferrals in oncologic surgery, systemic therapy, and radiotherapy; and visits for oncologic patients.6\n\nConsequently, cancer screening programs have been temporarily interrupted in most countries. Although these measures may have led to a reduction in COVID-19 transmission,7 their association with public health must still be determined.8\n\nBecause the lockdown restrictions have been heterogeneous in their beginning date and duration, we performed a systematic review of studies that analyzed the variation in the total number of examinations for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening performed since the beginning of the epidemic in comparison with the prepandemic period. Our aim was to quantify the global variation of cancer screening procedures during the lockdown period.\n\nMethods\n\nSearch Strategy and Selection Criteria\n\nWe conducted our systematic review and meta-analysis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline.9 We developed the study question by following the patients or the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, and outcome) and study design framework.\n\nThis study is part of a larger project aimed at assessing the global effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with cancer, including not only cancer screening but also cancer diagnosis, diagnostic tests for cancer, therapies for oncologic patients, and first visits and follow-up visits for oncology patients. The search string was unique for all these outcomes. We launched the search string on PubMed, ProQuest, and Scopus, without language restriction, for articles published between January 1, 2020, and December 12, 2021. The search string was made using Boolean operators (AND, OR) and Medical Subject Headings terms and their builder options, if relevant, to improve the search results. Searches were performed with the following terms: neoplasms, diagnosis, drug therapy, radiotherapy, surgery, therapy, diagnosis, epidemiology, prevention and control, early detection of cancer, COVID-19, and organization and administration.\n\nWe included observational studies and articles that reported data from cancer registries. We chose articles including a comparison between the periods before and after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with results indicated as number of screening tests performed, percentage variation between the 2 periods, or rate of screening. Studies were excluded if data on at least 1 of these comparisons were not available. We included only studies in which the 2 compared periods were explicitly stated. If the comparison was made between 2 or more pre\u2013COVID-19 periods, we selected the closest period as a reference (eg, we considered 2019 if data for both 2019 and 2018 were available).\n\nData Collection and Quality Assessment\n\nOur database search and study selection process are outlined in the flow diagram (Figure 1). We found a total of 3630 total articles: 998 articles on PubMed, 1471 on ProQuest, and 1161 on Scopus. We collected initial references in citation files, removed duplicates (1007 articles), and began our screening process of the remaining 2623 articles. We initially excluded articles in languages other than English, French, Spanish, or Italian, and also reviews, meta-analyses, or case reports (245 articles). After this process, studies were first reviewed by title and then by abstract. Finally, we examined the full text of each article against eligibility criteria, and we collected 140 studies for all the outcomes of the research project (screening, diagnosis, diagnostic tests, visits, and therapies). Results on cancer screening were reported in 39 articles. We decided to analyze the types of cancer screening recommended for the general population by the US Preventive Services Task Force.10-12 We excluded screening types performed for high-risk individuals (eg, lung cancer screening13) and those with lower-grade recommendation (eg, prostate cancer screening14). The title and abstract of the articles were independently reviewed by 2 pairs of reviewers (F.T. and G.C.; M.A. and L.A.) for inclusion in the first screening phase, followed by the full-text screening phase against eligibility criteria. Disagreements among reviewers in the initial abstract screening phase and full-text review were resolved through discussion with a fifth reviewer (P.B.).\n\nTwo pairs of reviewers (F.T. and G.C.; M.A. and L.A.) perused the prepared checklist to extract from each article the following information: name of the first author, year of publication, country and type of setting (hospitals and private centers were considered clinic based; local and national cancer registries were considered population based), site of cancer, type of screening analyzed (mammography, research of blood in the stool with the fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test, colonoscopy, Papanicolaou test, or human papillomavirus test), and absolute number or rate of screening tests performed in the analyzed period or percentage variation between intervals before and after the beginning of the pandemic. In particular, for colorectal cancer screening, we analyzed data from both types of screening (fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test and colonoscopy) separately and together.\n\nWe performed an assessment of the quality and risk of bias of all the studies included, using 9 of the 10 items of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme for qualitative research,15 for a maximum score of 10 points. Studies obtaining less than 7 points were considered inadequate and excluded (no article was excluded because of a low-quality score). eTables 1 through 3 in the Supplement list the articles included in the present analysis and their major characteristics and quality assessment.\n\nStatistical Analyses\n\nFor each type of screening, we calculated the weighted average of the percentage variation between screening tests performed before and after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The weight was calculated with the natural logarithm of the number of daily events in the prepandemic period (ie, daily_screen_precovid obtained by dividing the number of screening tests in the prepandemic period by its duration in days: weight = ln [daily_screen_precovid]). We used the logarithm because of the great variability in the number of tests between studies. We used the absolute value to avoid negative weights.\n\nSome studies did not provide the absolute number of screening tests performed in the prepandemic period, but only the measure of variation between the period being examined and the reference period. For these studies, to calculate the weight, we imputed a value of daily_screen_precovid as the mean value of this variable in the studies having the same type of setting and cancer screening.\n\nWe divided the pandemic period into 5 intervals (all referring to 2020) based on the beginning date of the COVID-19 period being examined in each article as follows: period 1 from January 1 to February 29; period 2 from March 1 to March 31; period 3 from April 1 to April 30; period 4 from May 1 to May 31; and period 5 from June 1 to October 31. This partition of the 5 periods was based on temporal distribution of the available observations along the pandemic period and on the trend of COVID-19 spread and pandemic measures in most countries.16 We did not include studies in which the pandemic period started before January 2020. We did not find studies in which the pandemic period of observation started after October 2020. Studies could contribute to more than 1 period, but not more than once in each period. Then we calculated weighted averages for each interval. Because each period analyzed was determined only by the starting date of the observation, for some studies it could include an interval longer than the predefined periods (eg, an observation that considered January 1 as the starting date and May 31 as the end date was included in the first period).\n\nAn additional analysis was performed for specific geographic areas and for type of setting. We finally fitted ordinary least-squares linear model using Newton-Raphson (maximum likelihood) optimization with percentage change as dependent variables and terms for type of structure, geographic area, and period as independent variables. In the linear regression model, 2-sided P values were used, with P < .05 considered statistically significant.\n\nBecause a percentage reduction could not be lower than \u2212100%, we limited the values of the 95% CIs to \u2212100.0% in case they exceeded it. We considered the funnel plot and performed the Egger regression asymmetry test to assess publication bias.17\n\nNo ethics committee approval and no patient consent were necessary because the study was restricted to publicly available data. For all statistical analyses, we used Stata, version 16.1 (StataCorp). P values of differences of means are based on the t test, those of differences of proportions are based on z scores, and P tests of multivariate analyses are those derived from the regression generalized linear models for the respective variables.\n\nResults\n\nData on race and ethnicity, as well as demographic information for the study population, were not available. eTable 4 in the Supplement shows the weighted average variation of screening tests performed by cancer type, and Figure 2 shows the corresponding temporal trend.\n\nBreast Cancer\n\nThe average variation of breast cancer screening from January to October 2020 was \u221246.7% (95% CI, \u221255.5% to \u221237.8%) compared with the pre\u2013COVID-19 period. The maximum decrease in breast cancer screening occurred in April 2020 (\u221274.3% [95% CI, \u221291.8% to \u221256.7%]), whereas after June there was no significant reduction (\u221213.0% [95% CI, \u221233.0% to 7.1%]). The weighted average of the screening variation was \u221262.0% (95% CI, \u221275.1% to \u221249.0%) for clinic-based settings and \u221241.6% (95% CI, \u221253.2% to \u221230.0%) for population-based ones. The difference between the 2 types of structures was confirmed to be statistically significant in the linear regression analysis (adjusted difference, 18.9%; 95% CI, 2.0% to 35.9%; P = .03) (Table 1).\n\nWe divided the geographic areas for breast cancer screening according to the distribution of the countries analyzed in each study: North America (United States and Canada), South America (Brazil, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay), and Europe (Italy, France, and Turkey). In North America, the number of breast cancer screening tests decreased by \u221244.6% (95% CI, \u221257.4% to \u221231.8%) during the COVID-19 period. In this geographic area, the decrease was \u221219.4% (95% CI, \u221255.1% to 16.2%) in January and February, \u221249.9% (95% CI, \u221266.5% to \u221233.2%) in March, \u221286.7% (95% CI, \u2212100.0% to \u221273.5%) in April, \u221237.8% (95% CI, \u221262.3% to \u221213.4%) in May, and 0.8% (95% CI, \u221214.1% to 15.7%) from June to October 2020. Europe presented an average variation of \u221267.7% (95% CI, \u2212100.0% to \u22129.3%), and South America presented an average variation of \u221251.1% (95% CI, \u221267.5% to \u221234.7%). As shown in Table 1, the decrease during April was significant (\u221253.8%; 95% CI, \u221275.4% to \u221232.2%; P < .001), using January and February as the reference; studies from Europe also reported a larger decrease compared with those from North America (\u221235.6%; 95% CI, \u221265.9% to \u22125.3%; P = .02).\n\nColorectal Cancer\n\nThe overall decrease in the number of colorectal cancer screening examinations performed throughout the period from January to October 2020 compared with the pre\u2013COVID-19 period was equal to \u221244.9% (95% CI, \u221253.8% to \u221236.1%). In particular, the decrease for colonoscopy was \u221252.5% (95% CI, \u221266.3% to \u221238.8%), and the decrease for fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test was \u221237.8% (95% CI, \u221249.9% to \u221225.8%). The weighted average variation was \u221251.5% (95% CI, \u221269.5% to \u221233.6%) in clinic-based settings and \u221243.7% (95% CI, \u221254.9% to \u221232.6%) in population-based ones.\n\nCompared with the prepandemic period, the global evolution by period showed the greatest decrease in April 2020 (\u221269.3% [95% CI, \u2212100.0% to \u221236.9%]) and only a partial recovery during the last months of the analysis (\u221223.4% [95% CI, \u221244.4% to \u22122.4%]) from June to October (eTable 4 in the Supplement).\n\nWe analyzed the 3 main geographic areas, including North America (United States and Canada), Asia (India, China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore), and Europe (Italy, France, and the United Kingdom). The weighted average variation during the entire COVID-19 period was \u221245.1% (95% CI, \u221259.3% to \u221231.0%) for North America, \u221234.6% (95% CI, \u221258.1% to \u221211.1%) for Asia, and \u221252.4% (95% CI, \u221269.4% to \u221235.3%) for Europe. For North America, the greatest decrease was in April (\u221283.0% [95% CI, \u2212100.0% to \u221255.8%]), whereas in Asia the most remarkable decrease in screening rates was observed in January and February (\u221236.2% [95% CI, \u221277.9% to \u22125.6%]). In linear regression analysis, April had a greater decrease compared with January and February (\u221238.3%; 95% CI, \u221263.6% to \u221212.9%; P = .003), whereas there was no statistically significant difference between geographic areas (Table 2).\n\nCervical Cancer\n\nFor cervical cancer screening, the weighted average variation was equal to \u221251.8% (95% CI, \u221264.7% to \u221238.9%). The maximum decrease observed among the 5 periods was in March (\u221278.8% [95% CI, \u221299.3% to \u221258.3%]). In the linear regression model (Table 3), a significant decrease was observed in March compared with January and February (\u221238.9%; 95% CI, \u221275.2% to \u22122.5%; P = .04). Clinic-based studies showed a greater reduction than the population-based ones: \u221251.7% (95% CI, \u221277.3% to \u221226.1%) and \u221251.9% (95% CI, \u221267.8% to \u221235.9%), respectively. In North America (United States and Canada), the weighted average variation was \u221244.7% (95% CI, \u221273.8% to \u221215.7%), whereas in South America (Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Puerto Rico), it was \u221262.4% (95% CI, \u221273.3% to \u221251.5%).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study investigated the association of the COVID-19 pandemic measures with cancer screening by systematic review. Against a global pattern showing an increasing trend for colorectal cancer screening and a slight decrease for cervical cancer screening and mammography from 2000 to 2015,18 our study found a marked association with a decrease in the number of tests performed for the 3 cancer types (\u221246.7%, \u221244.9%, and \u221251.8% for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening, respectively) in all geographic areas considered during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Beyond the decision to interrupt all cancer screening programs, the main factors that may have caused this reduction were stay-at-home orders, people's fear of the infection, avoidance of nonurgent medical treatment and care, limited access to in-person medical examinations, and the reorganization of hospital departments.6 The greater decrease for the Papanicolaou test or human papillomavirus test and colonoscopies may be attributable to more invasive techniques used to diagnose these tumors compared with mammography for breast cancer and fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test for colorectal cancer.\n\nWe identified a similar pattern by period for breast and colorectal cancer screening, with a U-shaped trend having a negative peak in April 2020 and an attenuation in May. This trend was largely attributable to the lockdown measures in numerous countries and territories worldwide. As illustrated through the stringency index of the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker,16 in April 2020 most of the countries had implemented COVID-19 measures. All 3 types of cancer screening showed the least reduction from June to October.\n\nA significant feature of the present study is the analysis of different geographic areas; Europe presented a larger decrease in mammograms compared with North America (Table 1), which could be associated with the fact that in the United States, they are mostly performed through private health insurance,18 whereas in Europe, they are usually provided as part of the public health care system. Conversely, the decrease was similar for colorectal cancer screening between the 2 regions. The restrictions that occurred in Europe could therefore have had a greater association with the cancer screening procedures that imply an actual attendance to the health care structure providing the service. Our results indicated that invasive colorectal cancer screenings (colonoscopies) had a larger decrease than noninvasive ones, such as fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test (\u221252.5% vs 37.8%, respectively), which were more easily performed as a colonoscopy alternative.19 Unlike the global decrease in colorectal cancer screening, Asia presented the most remarkable decrease in January and February; however, the variability of COVID-19 epidemiology and restrictive measures between Asian countries20,21 complicates the interpretation of this matter.\n\nThe percentage variation for cervical and breast cancer screening was greater in South America compared with North America (\u221262.4% vs \u221244.7% and \u221251.1% vs \u221244.6%, respectively); however, we cannot assume that it will result in worse consequences for Latin America owing to its weaker health care system before the pandemic.22\n\nAn important aspect of our review was the consistency of results across a wide spectrum of health care settings. The association between the epidemic and cancer screening was greater in studies based in hospitals or other clinic settings than in population-based studies, especially for breast cancer screening (\u221262.0% vs \u221241.6%; P = .03), which could be explained by clinic-based studies\u2019 considering only the decrease in the number of patients who actually attended the screening test vs population-based studies\u2019 including also patients who did not participate in screening programs in the prepandemic period. There was no evidence of publication bias either qualitatively according to funnel plot asymmetry or quantitatively with the Egger regression test.\n\nThe aim of identifying early neoplastic lesions in the case of breast cancer and precursor lesions in the case of colorectal and cervical cancer was to decrease the incidence of invasive cancer.23 The most concerning potential effect of a decrease in cancer screening is an increase in cancer mortality, as estimated in the United States.24 The interruption of cancer screening could delay diagnosis of tumors, causing a shift to more advanced stages at diagnosis. Furthermore, this could be associated with increased avoidable cancer deaths, aggravate the patients\u2019 discomfort and disease burden, and be associated with increased workload for medical personnel and increased costs for the health care system.8,25,26 In addition, a portion of the postponed screening tests could be impossible to recover because during the suspension some patients exceeded the maximum age to be included in screening programs.\n\nLimitations\n\nOur review has some limitations. First, considerable heterogeneity between countries was present in terms of screening protocols,27 services\u2019 accessibility and participation of the target population, lockdown measures, and incidence of COVID-19 and its temporal trend; all of these factors could not be considered in our statistical analysis. Second, the attribution of an observation to 1 of the 5 periods was based only on its beginning date, which might lead to nondifferential misclassification. Future studies on variations in screening numbers will need to be performed to clarify long-term implications and adopt adequate public health strategies. Third, in some studies we had to impute the number of daily events to calculate the weight.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe results of our systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that there is an association between the COVID-19 pandemic and a reduction in breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening, with a U-shaped temporal pattern. Although for breast and cervical cancer screening, the data suggest a recovery after May 2020, the decrease in colorectal cancer screening persisted until October 2020. This is expected to be associated with an increase of avoidable advanced cancers and cancer-related deaths. Further investigation regarding cancer diagnosis and cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic is required.\n\nBack to top Article Information\n\nAccepted for Publication: May 18, 2022.\n\nPublished Online: July 7, 2022. doi:10.1001/jamaoncol.2022.2617\n\nCorresponding Author: Paolo Boffetta, MD, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna, Via Massarenti 9, 40138 Bologna, Italy (paolo.boffetta@unibo.it).\n\nAuthor Contributions: Drs Teglia and Angelini had full access to all of the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.\n\nConcept and design: Teglia, Angelini, Boffetta.\n\nAcquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data: Teglia, Angelini, Astolfi, Casolari.\n\nDrafting of the manuscript: Teglia, Angelini, Astolfi, Casolari.\n\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content: Teglia, Angelini, Boffetta.\n\nStatistical analysis: Teglia, Angelini.\n\nSupervision: Teglia, Angelini, Boffetta.\n\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.",

        "AMA News Wire Second COVID-19 vaccine booster dose: Answering patients\u2019 questions\n\nThe newest wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections, reinfections and breakthrough infections are fueled by the more transmissible COVID-19 Omicron variant and its subvariants. And now, with the BA.5 subvariant comprising a majority of cases in the United States, and reported COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations rising, there\u2019s a growing need for more people to not only get vaccinated but boosted too. Yet confusion remains around the second COVID-19 booster dose.\n\nAdvancing public health The AMA leads the charge on public health. Our members are the frontline of patient care, expanding access to care for underserved patients and developing key prevention strategies. Join the AMA\n\nHere are some questions patients might have about second COVID-19 vaccine booster dose, along with the answers that physicians should be ready to share.\n\nWhy are booster doses needed? Why are booster doses needed?\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines are working well to prevent severe illness, hospitalization and death, but the latest data show that booster doses significantly increase protection against the Omicron variant. That is why a booster dose\u2014or in some cases two\u2014are recommended.\n\nIn the face of the Omicron variant, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that, compared with people who have received their primary series and two booster doses, unvaccinated adults 50\u201364 years old were 45 times more likely to be hospitalized from COVID-19. Unvaccinated seniors were 51 times likelier to land in the hospital.\n\nResearch published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report also shows that during both Delta- and Omicron-predominant periods, receipt of a third vaccine dose of a mRNA vaccine was highly effective at preventing COVID-19-associated emergency department and urgent care encounters as well as preventing hospitalization.\n\nMeanwhile, a JAMA study shows that receipt of three doses of a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine\u2014compared with being unvaccinated or having received two doses\u2014was associated with protection against both the Omicron and Delta variants.\n\nWho is eligible for a second booster dose? Who is eligible for a second booster dose?\n\nA second booster dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are recommended for people over 50. A second booster is also recommended for certain people 12 years or older who are moderately or severely immunocompromised.\n\nAdditionally, people 18 through 49 years old who got a Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine for both their primary dose and booster can choose to get a second booster of an mRNA vaccine.\n\nDiscover what doctors wish patients knew about COVID-19 vaccine boosters.\n\nHow soon can you get a second booster dose? How soon can you get a second booster dose?\n\nFor people over 50 and with compromised immune systems, a second booster dose should be administered four months after receiving an initial booster dose. And adults who got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for their primary series and booster dose at least four months ago, should get a second booster dose of either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nRelated Coverage What doctors wish patients knew about COVID-19 vaccine boosters\n\nCan I mix and match vaccines for my booster dose? Can I mix and match vaccines for my booster dose?\n\nThrough the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s authorization and the CDC\u2019s recommendation, heterologous boosting\u2014aka \u201cmixing and matching\u201d\u2014is allowed with a single dose of any of the authorized COVID-19 vaccine boosters for people 18 years or older. For example, those who got Johnson & Johnson\u2019s one-dose series can receive a booster shot from Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech.\n\nPhysicians will look at the clinical considerations, including rare adverse events, and perform an individual benefit-risk assessment to inform patients about which booster vaccine to use. Mixing and matching may only be considered for the booster dose.\n\nWhich vaccine booster should I get? Which vaccine booster should I get?\n\nThe CDC recommends individuals get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine over Johnson & Johnson\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThis came after the Food and Drug Administration revised the fact sheets for J&J COVID-19 vaccine physicians and other health professionals (PDF) and patients (PDF), which now include a contraindication for people with a history of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (TTS) following the J&J vaccine. Women 30\u201349 years old are at highest risk, with one in 100,000 developing TTS after J&J vaccination.\n\nWhat is the difference between an additional dose and a booster dose? What is the difference between an additional dose and a booster dose?\n\nAn additional dose is often administered to people with moderately to severely compromised immune systems to improve their response to their initial vaccine series. A COVID-19 booster dose is given when a person has completed their primary vaccine series and protection against SARS-CoV-2 has decreased over time.\n\nThat is why patients with compromised immune systems are receiving a third dose of a COVID-19 vaccine rather than a booster. This can be either Pfizer or Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. In addition to a third dose, these individuals may receive two booster shots.\n\nIs it better to get the second booster in the summer or fall? Is it better to get the second booster in the summer or fall?\n\nThe FDA has asked Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna to develop bivalent vaccines that are designed to target the original coronavirus strain, as well as the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. This is because it is critical that there are safe and effective vaccine boosters that can provide protection against circulating and emerging variants. The FDA hopes the updated vaccines will be available in October. However, if you are eligible for a booster now, you should get a second booster dose and not wait for the bivalent vaccines to be made available.\n\nThis means people older than 50 and anyone over 12 years old who are immunocompromised should get a second booster sooner rather than later. Those who were recently infected with an Omicron subvariant, may choose to wait 90 days before getting a second booster.\n\nIt is hard to say what SARS-CoV-2 will do in the fall, which means getting a COVID-19 vaccine booster as soon as someone is eligible is key.\n\nHow can I talk to my parents and grandparents about getting a COVID-19 booster? How can I talk to my parents and grandparents about getting a COVID-19 booster?\n\nFor some, it can be hard to talk with relatives who may have concerns or questions about getting vaccinated, especially parents and grandparents. However, older adults are at a greater risk of being hospitalized or dying of COVID-19 if they catch the disease.\n\nEveryone\u2019s motivations for skipping the vaccine or booster doses are different. That is why it can be helpful to sit down and talk with loved ones. This is where it is important to acknowledge their concerns, share facts and recommend they speak with their physician to learn more.\n\nDiscover how to have crucial conversations with vaccine-hesitant patients.\n\nRelated Coverage What sets apart Novavax option from other COVID-19 vaccines\n\nIf I haven\u2019t had a first booster dose, is it too late? If I haven\u2019t had a first booster dose, is it too late?\n\nNo, it is never too late to get a booster, says the CDC. For those who have not yet received their first booster dose, they should go out and get it. This is because the evidence is strong, showing that a booster dose helps to prevent more severe outcomes with the Omicron variant and its subvariants.\n\nI\u2019m fully vaccinated, so why do I need a booster? I\u2019m fully vaccinated, so why do I need a booster?\n\nImmunity from vaccination does wane over time, increasing your risk of infection or severe illness. But a booster dose dramatically increases a person\u2019s immune response and raised their level of protection against Omicron subvariants. The booster doses help to restore some protection that is lost as time passes.\n\nIn an episode of the \u201cAMA COVID-19 Update,\u201d Andrea Garcia, MPH, discusses second boosters.\n\nIf I still catch SARS-CoV-2, what\u2019s the point of a booster? If I still catch SARS-CoV-2, what\u2019s the point of a booster?\n\nSeveral Omicron subvariants are circulating around the United States. These subvariants are very transmissible and can overcome immunity. But people who are boosted have shorter periods of being infectious, which can protect other people around them. The booster dose also helps protect against severe outcomes of COVID-19 such as hospitalization or death.\n\nWhat side effects can I expect from a COVID-19 vaccine booster? What side effects can I expect from a COVID-19 vaccine booster?\n\nAfter the second booster shot, side effects may be more intense than previous doses, according to the CDC. Side effects that have been reported after getting a booster shot are similar to those after the two-dose or single-dose primary shots. The most reported side effects include fever, headache, fatigue and pain at the injection site.\n\nOverall, most side effects were mild to moderate. But these side effects are normal and are signs that the body is building protection and should go away within a few days, according to the CDC.\n\nThe AMA has developed frequently-asked-questions documents on COVID-19 vaccination covering safety, allocation and distribution, administration and more. There are two FAQs, one designed to answer patients\u2019 questions (PDF), and another to address physicians\u2019 COVID-19 vaccine questions (PDF).\n\nFind out more with the AMA about COVID-19 and vaccine development.",
        "In 2020, heart disease and cancer were the leading causes of death in the US, accounting for 1.29 million deaths, followed by COVID-19, accounting for 350 000 deaths.1-3 The pandemic may also have indirectly led to increases in other causes of death, including heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer disease, and unintentional injuries.2,4 We examined the leading causes of death in the US, overall and in various age groups, from March 2020 to October 2021.\n\nMethods\n\nWe obtained final national death certificate data for 2020 and provisional data for 2021 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (accessed May 5, 20225). We excluded data more recent than October 2021 because they were incomplete. We determined the 5 leading causes of death by year and age group, and compared the period March to December 2020 with the period January to October 2021. Because the data are publicly available, the study did not require institutional review board review.\n\nResults\n\nFrom March 2020 to October 2021, heart disease (20.1%), cancer (17.5%), COVID-19 (12.2%), accidents (6.2%), and stroke (4.7%) were the most common causes of death in the US. There were 2.875 million deaths in March to December 2020 and 2.855 million deaths in January to October 2021; the 5 leading causes of death were the same in each year. Among those older than 1 year, the number of deaths increased across age groups.\n\nDeaths from cancer, heart disease, and COVID-19 accounted for the largest number of deaths in every group aged 55 years and older (Table, Figure). The leading 3 causes of death in these age groups were the same in 2020 and 2021. Among people aged 85 years and older, COVID-19 was ranked as the second leading cause of death in 2020 (110 000 deaths, 12.8% of deaths), and third in 2021 (69 000, 8.9% of deaths). Among those aged 45 to 54 years, COVID-19 was the fourth leading cause of death in 2020 (17 000 deaths, 10.4% of deaths), following heart disease, cancer, and accidents; in 2021, however, it was the leading cause of death (30 000 deaths, 16.8% of deaths).\n\nIn both time periods, accidents accounted for the largest number of deaths in every age group 1 to 44 years. Compared with 2020, COVID-19 increased from the fifth (6100 deaths) to the second leading cause of death (13 000 deaths) among those aged 35 to 44 years in 2021, became the fourth leading cause of death in 2021 among those aged 25 to 34 years (5000 deaths), and those aged 15 to 24 years (1100 deaths).\n\nDiscussion\n\nFrom March 2020 to October 2021, COVID-19 accounted for 1 in 8 deaths in the US and was a top 5 cause of death in every age group aged 15 years and older. Cancer and heart disease deaths exceeded COVID-19 deaths overall and in most age groups, whereas accidents were the leading cause of death among those aged 1 to 44 years. Compared with the 2020 time period, deaths from COVID-19 in the 2021 time period decreased in ranking among those aged 85 years or older but increased in ranking among those aged 15 to 54 years, and became the leading cause of death among those aged 45 to 54 years.\n\nThe increased ranking of COVID-19 as a leading cause of death in some age groups is consistent with a downward age shift in the distribution of COVID-19 deaths in the US in 2021 compared with 2020,6 perhaps driven by higher COVID-19 vaccination rates in 2021 in the oldest age groups.\n\nThe pandemic also has had indirect effects on other causes of death in the US. From 2019 to 2020, death rates increased for heart disease, accidents, stroke, Alzheimer disease, and diabetes.2 Potential explanations are fear of accessing health care or misattribution of COVID-19 deaths to other causes.4 Accidental deaths (including drug overdoses and unintentional alcohol poisoning), assault, and suicide remain major causes of death in the US, particularly in younger age groups; the pandemic may have contributed to some of these deaths.\n\nOur analysis was limited by potential misclassification of the cause of death and incomplete death data for 2021, although we included a lag of 6 months to increase the completeness of the provisional data. Moreover, because our analysis only extended through October 2021, it does not include deaths that occurred during the Omicron wave of the pandemic of late 2021 and early 2022.\n\nBack to top Article Information\n\nAccepted for Publication: May 9, 2022.\n\nPublished Online: July 5, 2022. doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2022.2476\n\nCorresponding Author: Meredith S.

        "Key Points\n\nQuestion Is participation in a remote monitoring program for COVID-19, supported by nurses around the clock, associated with subsequent hospitalization?\n\nFindings In this cohort study of 9378 patients, participation in a remote monitoring program was associated with lower odds of hospitalization 2 to 14 days after a positive COVID-19 test, after an adjusted analysis using inverse propensity score weighting.\n\nMeaning These findings suggest that remote patient monitoring for COVID-19 may help patients better manage symptoms at home and help hospitals better manage bed capacity.\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance Health care systems have implemented remote patient monitoring (RPM) programs to manage patients with COVID-19 at home, but the associations between participation and outcomes or resource utilization are unclear.\n\nObjective To assess whether an RPM program for COVID-19 is associated with lower or higher likelihood of hospitalization and whether patients who are admitted present earlier or later for hospital care.\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants This retrospective, observational, cohort study of RPM was performed at Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin Health Network, an academic health system in southeastern Wisconsin. Participants included patients with internal primary care physicians and a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in the ambulatory setting between March 30, 2020, and December 15, 2020. Data analysis was performed from February 15, 2021, to February 2, 2022.\n\nExposures Activation of RPM program.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures Hospitalizations within 2 to 14 days of a positive test. Inverse propensity score weighting was used to account for differences between groups. Sensitivity analyses were performed looking at usage of the RPM among patients who activated the program.\n\nResults A total of 10 660 COVID-19\u2013positive ambulatory patients were eligible, and 9378 (88.0%) had email or mobile numbers on file and were invited into the RPM program; the mean (SD) age was 46.9 (16.3) years and 5448 patients (58.1%) were women. Patients who activated monitoring (5364 patients [57.2%]) had a mean (SD) of 35.3 (33.0) check-ins and a mean (SD) of 1.27 (2.79) (median [IQR], 0 [0-1]) free-text comments. A total of 878 patients (16.4%) experienced at least 1 alert; 128 of 5364 activated patients (2.4%) and 158 of 4014 inactivated patients (3.9%) were hospitalized (\u03c72 1 = 18.65; P < .001). In weighted regression analysis, activation of RPM was associated with a lower odds of hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54-0.86; P = .001) adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, and time period. Monitored patients had a longer mean (SD) time between test and hospitalization (6.67 [3.21] days vs 5.24 [3.03] days), a shorter length of stay (4.44 [4.43] days vs 7.14 [8.63] days), and less intensive care use (15 patients [0.3%] vs 44 patients [1.1%]).\n\nConclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that activation of an RPM program is associated with lower hospitalization, intensive care use, and length of stay among patients with COVID-19.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has required substantial and expeditious changes to health care systems to address challenges posed toward allocating hospital resources, preventing community transmission, and treating patients.1-4 Particularly during the pandemic onset and the waves of more contagious variants, substantial strain has been placed on hospital systems to address shortages of staff, beds, and supplies,5 forcing them to implement rationing programs and measures to match patients with the most appropriate level of care.6 To mitigate community transmission and optimize resource utilization, health care systems have rapidly expanded telemedicine programs across all specialties.7,8 In addition, strategies to care for people at home using remote patient monitoring (RPM) were created to triage and manage patients with COVID-19, who may worsen during the duration of their illness.9 For example, patients who present with mild symptoms at initial diagnosis can deteriorate greatly during the course of their illness, requiring hospital admission and critical care.10 Although RPM has generally been trialed in the management of chronic disease, it may also be an effective tool to manage health care resources for more acute episodes of care.8,11-14\n\nPrevious studies8,15,16 evaluated home monitoring in patients with COVID-19 with mild symptoms during self-isolation, with early studies17 showing positive results with fewer admissions. Pulse oximetry at home has been successful in identifying patients needing emergent medical attention.14,18-20 It is unclear, however, whether participating in an RPM program is associated with patient outcomes or appropriate in-person resource utilization.\n\nOur objective in this study is to evaluate the implementation of a large-scale daily RPM program for patients with COVID-19 who were managing symptoms from home. We particularly sought to assess the association of RPM with health care utilization (ie, whether RPM would be associated with increased or decreased admissions compared with those not undergoing monitoring). Secondarily, we sought to see whether patients who were eventually admitted would present earlier or later for hospital care. In these analyses, we sought to also know whether RPM was associated with inappropriate admissions (length of stay \u22641 day) or inappropriate home care (a delayed presentation leading to higher mortality, intensive care utilization, or length of stay).\n\nMethods\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\n\nThis cohort study was conducted within an academic-community health system in southeastern Wisconsin. Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin Health Network provides 1.5 million ambulatory visits and cares for 55 000 hospitalized patients annually. The Health Network operates 45 clinic locations in the Milwaukee metropolitan area.\n\nAll patients who underwent COVID-19 testing at an affiliated laboratory site who tested positive were eligible for the program. Any patient could request testing either through our mobile application, patient portal, telephone, or in-person urgent care or scheduled ambulatory visits. Patients were automatically invited to enroll in the RPM program if their email address or mobile telephone number was on file at the time of testing. Patients were also invited if they had an affiliated primary care physician (PCP) within the system and had an outside positive test that was abstracted into the electronic health record (EHR). Patients signed a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act waiver and agreed to the program\u2019s terms of use at enrollment. In addition to the email invitation, patients received a COVID Care Kit, a collection of educational materials, handouts, and a pulse oximeter that was available to pick up from testing sites; after October 2020, kits were automatically shipped to patients.\n\nThe program group was defined as any patient who activated the RPM program. Activation was defined as claiming an account within the RPM platform. As a sensitivity analysis, we secondarily assessed participation if the patient, in addition to activating their account, had at least 1 or more check-ins, which are programmed questions to which patients respond.\n\nThis study was reviewed and approved by the Medical College of Wisconsin institutional review board. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines for reporting observational studies were followed.21\n\nInclusion and Exclusion Criteria\n\nAll patients were included if they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the period of March 31, 2020, through December 15, 2020, at an affiliated laboratory site. Follow-up data collection for hospitalization within 14 days continued through December 31, 2020. We excluded patients younger than 18 years, those with asymptomatic tests (because these were often scheduled before procedures or other planned admissions), abstracted results, and patients who were admitted within 24 hours of a positive test. We further limited the patient sample to those who had internal PCPs to reduce the chance of missing hospitalizations.\n\nCOVID-19 RPM Program\n\nThe COVID-19 RPM program was an automated engagement solution, supported by registered nurses, designed to improve the patient experience, coordinate care, and improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19. On March 30, 2020, the system began the program using GetWellLoop (GetWellNetwork) monitored by a centralized team of Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin nurses. Patients either used a responsive web application or downloaded a mobile application. Patients were asked to track their symptoms, temperatures, and pulse oximetry readings, if available. The program provided 14 days of check-ins related to progress and symptoms, in the form of questions and structured responses, while also providing a space for free-text comments (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). The program also provided educational guidance related to COVID-19, including caring for themselves at home, minimizing spread, and stress management.\n\nA centralized virtual care team (VCT) monitored patient check-ins and free-text comments around the clock. Abnormal survey responses (eg, breathing issues or worsening fever) alerted VCT members on their dashboard. Upon reviewing the alert, the VCT contacted patients to initiate an escalation of care or to conduct further medical evaluation if warranted. VCT nurses also reacted to patient comments independently from alerts to provide education or coaching, such as how to incorporate lying in the prone position (ie, proning) into their daily care. Patients were discharged from monitoring after 18 days.\n\nData Collection\n\nData for evaluating program outcomes were collected using reporting databases from the EHR (Epic Systems). We collected patient profile data, including sex, age, race, address, marital status, insurance, and PCP status (internal or external). Race was assessed in this study because of known racial and ethnic disparities in accessing digital health care services.22-24 We used patient addresses geocoded to the Census block level to determine the local area deprivation index, derived from the US Census and American Community Survey,25 as a measure of socioeconomic status and grouped by quartile.26-28\n\nData about the clinical scenario (including presence of symptoms and their onset) were derived from the individual testing orders. We obtained other clinical data, including body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and comorbidities as calculated through the Charlson Comorbidity Index29,30 from the EHR as of the testing date. Participation in the RPM program was provided through platform usage data. These data included system registration, activation, check-ins, alerts, and comments.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\n\nOur primary outcome was hospitalization within 14 days of a positive COVID-19 test. Hospitalizations were included if they had a flag as being related to COVID-19 through laboratory testing or hospital billing diagnosis. Hospitalizations outside the health system were not available, and readmissions were excluded from the analysis. To reduce the likelihood of missing outside hospitalizations, we limited the analysis to patients with an internal PCP because patients with external PCPs may be more likely to seek hospital care elsewhere.\n\nTo know whether RPM inadvertently may have been associated with increased mortality, such as by delaying hospitalization, we secondarily tracked patient deaths of the study cohort. Thirty-day mortality and 90-day mortality were defined as a patient marked as deceased within the EHR and/or having a death date noted within 30 or 90 days, respectively, of a positive test date. Mortality data were extracted from the EHR system in November 2021 in case death reporting in the EHR lagged.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nData analysis was performed from February 15, 2021, to February 2, 2022. To examine factors associated with activation, patients were divided into those who were enrolled and activated and those who were enrolled and did not activate. Age was categorized for analysis. We calculated the frequency for variables related to patient demographics and information related to personal health and COVID-19 status, along with means and SDs for time intervals, such as length of stay and time from test to hospitalization. A t test was used to test the mean difference of the 2 groups (RPM activated or not) in terms of the characteristics measured in continuous variables, whereas a \u03c72 test was adopted for categorical variables. For time intervals (time to hospitalization and length of stay), Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used. Two-sided tests were used with a priori levels of significance of \u03b1 = .05. All statistical analyses were performed using R programming language version 4.0.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing).31\n\nTo assess the association between activation and hospitalization, we performed propensity-weighted logistic regression using the glm package.32 With all patients being invited to use the RPM program, we used inverse propensity score weighting to account for potential bias in the observed covariates through self-selection or other mechanisms following methods by Olmos et al.33 Covariates included demographic variables, including age, sex, race, ethnicity, time period, insurance, marital status, Area Deprivation Index from the Census block level, encounter type where testing was ordered, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, prior hospitalization, and digital engagement proxied as having reviewed their COVID-19 test results electronically through the patient portal or the Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin mobile application. We also included a variable for time period (1 of the 3 waves in 2020) to allow for varying mean differences in outcomes over time due to patient behavior, including care avoidance34 at the beginning of the pandemic, and guideline changes during the 3 COVID-19 waves that could have affected enrollment status or clinical outcomes. The average treatment effect was calculated as the mean difference in weighted outcomes between the activated group and the invited but nonactivated group. Inverse probability weights were based on the propensity score of each patient,35 defined as the probability of a patient activating RPM conditional on observed covariates as described already, for doubly robust estimation.36\n\nWith less than 4% of the data missing observations for either socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, or obesity, the primary analysis was run on complete cases. We used multiple imputation using the mice37,38 package to confirm the results. We ran additional models that included only activated RPM patients and factoring whether they engaged in the program (had check-ins digitally) or not. We also performed propensity score matching with full matching39 using the MatchIT40 package. Finally, we performed a propensity-weighted Cox proportional-hazards analysis on complete-case data using the Survival41 and Survminer42 packages. In the weighted Cox model, the starting point was the date of the test and patients were only censored at day 14.\n\nResults\n\nDuring the study period, 135 786 patients underwent testing for COVID-19, and 25 040 patients (18.4%) had at least 1 positive test. Of these patients, 10 660 were retained for analysis after excluding those who were younger than 18 years, who did not have an internal PCP, or who were hospitalized at the time of testing (Figure 1). A total of 9378 patients (88.0%) were offered enrollment into the RPM program through an email invitation, comprising the final analytical cohort. The mean (SD) age of invited patients was 46.9 (16.3) years, and 5448 patients (58.1%) were women.\n\nEngagement With the RPM Program\n\nOf the 9378 invited patients, 5364 (57.2%) activated monitoring (Table 1). Patients who activated were predominantly female (3467 of 5364 patients [64.6%] vs 1981 of 4014 patients [49.4%]). Differences in activation by race and ethnicity were not significant, although differences by comorbidities were observed. Patients with Medicare were also less likely to activate than those without Medicare (795 of 5364 patients [14.8%] vs 769 of 4014 patients [19.2%]; \u03c72 3 = 38.65; P < .001). When patients requested testing through our digital platform for testing, 1805 of 2927 patients (61.7%) activated, whereas 354 of 723 patients (49.0%) with in-person visits activated (\u03c72 5 = 61.25; P < .001).\n\nPatients who activated had a mean (SD) of 35.3 (33.0) check-ins and a mean (SD) of 1.27 (2.79) (median [IQR], 0 [0-1]) comments with their clinical care teams. A total of 878 patients (16.4%) experienced at least 1 alert.\n\nUtilization and Clinical Outcomes\n\nOne hundred twenty-eight of 5364 activated patients (2.4%) and 158 of 4014 inactivated patients (3.9%) were hospitalized within 2 to 14 days of their test (\u03c72 1 = 18.65; P < .001) (Table 2). The odds of admission were higher for patients with advanced age, male gender, racial and ethnic minority groups, and those with obesity or more medical comorbidities. The mean (SD) time between test and hospitalization was slightly longer among activated patients (6.67 [3.21] days vs 5.24 [3.03] days). Among those patients admitted, the mean (SD) length of stay was 2.7 days lower for RPM-activated patients than for nonactivated patients (4.44 [4.43] days vs 7.14 [8.63] days; t = \u22123.4185; df = 244.03; P = .001). Monitored patients had less intensive care use than those who were not monitored (15 patients [0.3%] vs 44 patients [1.1%]). Patients with RPM were not significantly more likely to have short (length of stay \u22641 day) hospital stays (47 of 222 patients [21.2%] vs 50 of 210 patients [23.8%]). The unadjusted 90-day mortality for all patients was 0.2% (10 patients) among activated patients and 0.6% (26 patients) among nonactivated patients.\n\nLogistic Regression With Inverse Propensity Score Weighting\n\nIn multivariable regression analysis with inverse propensity score weighting (for the likelihood of activating RPM, the C statistic was 0.67; for balance and propensity distribution, see eFigure 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement), activation of RPM was associated with a lower odds of hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54-0.86; P = .001) (Table 3). Results using multiple imputation for missing data were similar (eTable 1 in the Supplement). As a robustness check, the Cox proportional-hazard regression with inverse propensity score weighting provided similar results (Figure 2 and eTable 2 in the Supplement), as did regression with propensity score matching (eTable 3 and eFigure 4 in the Supplement). As a sensitivity analysis of only activated patients, patients with check-ins had a lower odds of hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.33-0.73; P = .001) after weighting on propensity to have at least 1 check-in (eTable 4 in the Supplement).\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this retrospective cohort study of 9378 patients who were offered RPM for COVID-19, activation of the RPM program was associated with lower hospitalization, intensive care unit stay, and length of stay. Following an adjusted analysis using inverse propensity score weighting, patients who activated still had lower odds of being hospitalized, adjusted for observed clinical and sociodemographic characteristics.\n\nAlthough a strict control group was not available, because of the rapid implementation and goal of assisting patients and clinical operations, several methods including the inverse propensity score weighting and propensity score matching were used to balance the comparison cohorts on the basis of the observed covariates. The positive outcomes seen in reducing hospitalization are similar to those described in earlier studies.11,17,43-45 We found baseline differences between patients who did and did not active RPM, similar to prior studies, although our application of the inverse propensity score weighting provides a more robust mechanism for reducing the impact of these observed differences on our result and a more advanced analytical evaluation of the association of RPM with the main study outcomes. Our study is also different because it was delivered to a more general population as well.\n\nThe mechanism underlying RPM\u2019s association with hospitalization is not clear, but several factors may explain it. First, patients who were monitored also received education that may have affected their care trajectory, such as proning to help improve oxygenation. Second, physicians caring for patients who received the pulse oximetry and nurse support through the RPM might have felt comfortable not sending patients into the emergency department and hospital. An alternate explanation is that patients who activated were less ill, and residual confounding that could not be removed accounted for these differences. In both inverse propensity score weighting and propensity score matching, with reasonable C statistics and matching parameters, the associations persisted.\n\nIn addition to findings related to hospital admission, the data showed that patients who were admitted to the hospital while being monitored were hospitalized later than those without monitoring. Although the reasons behind such delays are not immediately known, there are different hypotheses that may explain this finding. One could be that the RPM program allowed patients to be managed and monitored at a level that would have required an admission for those who were not enrolled in the RPM\u2014that is, either the patient or a clinician chose to defer hospital-based care because of the availability of RPM. Another factor could be that the nurses\u2019 support through the RPM program delivered remote care that decreased risk and led to only essential admissions. This finding does not support a preintervention hypothesis that RPM would signal patients to be admitted earlier. The findings suggest that, although patients under RPM were admitted, on average, later than non-RPM patients, the late presentation was not inappropriate given that hospital length of stay, critical care utilization, and mortality were not increased in this group.\n\nOur study also found that age and race were significantly associated with the risk of hospitalization. These results mirror the current body of evidence suggesting who is most at risk both for contracting COVID-19 and experiencing severe symptoms.46-48 To that end, although RPM and other digital interventions can be effective in deploying and allocating scarce health care resources, we must continue investigating whether such strategies exacerbate existing disparities in care utilization and outcomes. These disparities have been observed in many other digital health interventions, including video visits and telemedicine.49-51\n\nThe lessons learned from our study and others are numerous, although many questions remain regarding best practice RPM implementation for COVID-19 and other diseases and conditions. First, it remains unknown at which point in the course of disease RPM is most impactful on outcomes. Although the digital component of the RPM is easily scalable, concerns regarding other components should be carefully evaluated. In our study, we implemented a remote nurse support model. The virtual nurses had full access to the EHR and could communicate with clinical care teams. Expanding similar programs across multiple areas and diseases would require sophisticated operations and resource allocations. Further research and evaluation of these new remote operating models are warranted and should be carefully evaluated for safety.\n\nExpansion of these programs should consider access and equity. In a previous study,50 we have demonstrated that access to digital technology is disproportionate among racial groups and socioeconomic statuses. Our program was accessible to anyone with a smartphone, although some technological literacy is required. Simple text messaging may also help reach additional people.\n\nLimitations\n\nSome limitations of this study should be addressed. With the observational nature of the study, selection bias of healthier patients into the RPM activation exists, and although we used propensity score adjustment, residual confounding may still persist. The data were retrospective and sourced from databases, which may make the results less reliable. For example, we could not verify whether hospitalization, escalation of care, or mortality were a result of COVID-19 or another cause. To mitigate this effect, we attempted to limit follow-up data to include 15 days given the reported duration of symptoms, and we reexamined mortality data from the EHR after at least 9 months following the study period. Location and hospital system factors may have influenced enrollment rates and clinical outcomes, which could make our results less generalizable to all populations.\n\nIn addition, COVID-19 treatment guidelines (decision to place patients in the prone position or intubation recommendations), diagnosis (evolving symptom profile), and community transmission were highly dynamic during the early course of the pandemic.52,53 Clinical outcomes may have improved throughout the course of the pandemic. The RPM program was also rapidly updated throughout the pandemic, although the core content of monitoring, proning as tolerated, and infection control for ambulatory patients remained the same. These data were from the prevaccine era; after vaccines became available54 and distributed,55 the absolute benefit of RPM may have decreased for low-risk individuals.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis report builds upon experiences from other groups showing that RPM for COVID-19 was feasible and well-received, while adding data about outcomes. Moving beyond COVID-19, these data highlight where RPM can be a helpful adjunct to care. Resource optimization is a central tenet of both RPM and pandemic-era practices. If reducing avoidable admissions can be achieved through virtual interventions, then practitioners can focus on in-person care for the most ill patients while also limiting unnecessary contact at hospitals and clinics, which is key to decreasing the spread of COVID-19. These results may also be used to establish better care guidelines for those monitoring moderate symptoms from home. Future studies should include ethnically diverse and low health care access populations, which are shown to be at higher risk for poor outcomes in COVID-19.\n\nBack to top Article Information\n\nAccepted for Publication: May 2, 2022.\n\nPublished: July 7, 2022. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.21050\n\nOpen Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License. \u00a9 2022 Crotty BH et al.

ACIP provides recommendations on use of vaccines in the U.S. civilian population based on disease epidemiology, vaccine safety, vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, quality of evidence reviewed, economic analyses and implementation issues.\n\nThe American Medical Association partnered with FDA and CDC for a series of webinars further outlining the vaccine development and review process.\n\nWhat information does FDA require of manufacturers to issue an \"Emergency Use Authorization\"?\n\nData and information needed to support the issuance of an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by FDA were outlined in guidance from FDA entitled \"Emergency Use Authorization for Vaccines to Prevent COVID-19 (October 2020).\" The guidance discusses FDA's current thinking regarding the circumstances under which the issuance of an EUA would be appropriate including the safety and efficacy data to support an EUA.\n\nData to support an EUA request for an investigational COVID-19 vaccine that must be submitted to FDA include the following:\n\nChemistry, manufacturing and controls information\n\nNonclinical data and information\n\nClinical data and information\n\nAdministrative and regulatory information\n\nHow does a vaccine go from \"Authorized for emergency use\" to \"Licensed\" (i.e., approved) and how long will that take?\n\nThe FDA has indicated that following submission of an EUA request and the issuance of an EUA, they expect vaccine manufacturers to continue to collect placebo-controlled data in any ongoing trials for as long as feasible to obtain additional safety and effectiveness information and work towards submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) as soon as possible. Both Pfizer and Moderna have announced they plan to submit a BLA.\n\nAre mRNA vaccines safe?\n\nmRNA vaccines are being held to the same safety and effectiveness standards as all other types of vaccines in the United States. mRNA vaccines do not use the live virus that causes COVID-19 and they cannot give someone COVID-19. mRNA never enters the nucleus of the cell, which is where our genetic material (DNA) is kept. The cell breaks down and gets rid of the mRNA soon after it is finished using the instructions. The mRNA vaccines do not affect or interact with our DNA in any way.\n\nThere are currently no licensed mRNA vaccines in the United States. However, researchers have been studying mRNA vaccines for flu, Zika, rabies and cytomegalovirus (CMV). As soon as the necessary information about the virus that causes COVID-19 was available, scientists began designing the mRNA instructions for cells to build the unique spike protein into an mRNA vaccine. Beyond vaccines, cancer research has used mRNA to trigger the immune system to target specific cancer cells.\n\nMore information on mRNA vaccines is available from the CDC.\n\nVaccine allocation and distribution Vaccine allocation and distribution\n\nHow will vaccine be allocated to jurisdictions and other entities (i.e., federal entities or tribal nations)?\n\nInitial vaccine allocation to jurisdictions will happen on a pro-rata basis according to the jurisdiction's population. Jurisdictions have provided the locations where initial vaccine doses will be shipped. After initial distribution, jurisdictions will order their weekly allocations. Jurisdictions will place orders on behalf of providers.\n\nTribal Nations can opt to receive vaccine through their jurisdiction or through the Indian Health Service.\n\nHow can I determine my state's plan for vaccine operations and distribution?\n\nThe Association of State and Territorial Health Officials has created a compendium of state plans. The CDC has also posted the executive summaries of each jurisdiction's plan, to provide a general understanding of their strategy. Jurisdictions have provided the locations where initial vaccine doses will be shipped.\n\nWhen will vaccine be distributed to physician offices?\n\nIn April of 2021, the Biden administration issued guidance to states on Expanding COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution to Primary Care Providers to Address Disparities in Immunization. The guidance encourages states to significantly increase allocation of vaccines to primary care providers. The guidance recommends that at least 60% of doses distributed to medical offices be allocated to those located in the most socially vulnerable communities in each jurisdiction. The AMA has been urging the administration to increase the vaccine distribution to physician offices and this is a good first step.\n\nVaccine administration Vaccine administration\n\nWhat do physicians need to do to be eligible to administer COVID-19 vaccines?\n\nTo receive and administer COVID-19 vaccine and ancillary supplies, vaccination providers must enroll in the federal government COVID-19 Vaccination Program, coordinated through their jurisdiction's immunization program, by signing and agreeing to conditions outlined in the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement. CDC will make this agreement available to each jurisdiction's immunization program for use in conducting outreach and enrolling vaccination providers. Physicians should reach out to their state health department to enroll.\n\nWhat vaccine storage and handling requirements do physicians need to be aware of?\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination providers should refer to the \"EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers\" and manufacturer information for detailed storage and handling information for each vaccine. Most vaccine products will be provided in a two-dose series and some vaccine products will require special storage and handling (e.g., ultra-cold storage).\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine providers are required to:\n\nStore and handle COVID-19 vaccines under proper conditions, including maintaining cold chain conditions and chain of custody at all times in accordance with an EUA or vaccine package insert, manufacturer guidance and CDC guidance.\n\nMonitor storage unit temperatures at all times, using equipment and practices that comply with guidance in the CDC vaccine storage and handling toolkit.\n\nComply with immunization program guidance for handling temperature excursions.\n\nMonitor and comply with COVID-19 vaccine expiration dates.\n\nPreserve all records related to COVID-19 vaccine management for a minimum of three years.\n\nComply with federal instructions and timelines for disposing of COVID-19 vaccine and diluent, including unused doses.\n\nWhat will be included in the vaccine ancillary supply kits?\n\nAncillary supply kits will include needles, syringes, alcohol prep pads, COVID-19 vaccination record cards for each vaccine recipient and a minimal supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), including surgical masks and face shields, for vaccinators. Each kit that is centrally distributed by the CDC will include supplies needed to administer 100 doses of vaccine.\n\nNeedles, 105 per kit (various sizes for the population served by the ordering vaccination provider) 25-gauge, 1\" (if vaccination indicated for pediatric population) 22\u201325-gauge, 1-1.5\" (adult)\n\nSyringes, 105 per kit (ranging from 1\u20133 mL)\n\nAlcohol prep pads, 210 per kit\n\nFour surgical masks and two face shields for vaccinators per kit\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination record cards for vaccine recipients, 100 per kit\n\nVaccine needle guide detailing the appropriate length/gauge for injections based on route, age (for children), gender and weight (for adults)\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine development Get reliable information on developments in the authorization, distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Learn More\n\nIf a COVID-19 vaccine that requires mixing with diluent is ordered and shipped from CDC's centralized distributor, a mixing kit that includes the necessary needles, syringes and alcohol prep pads will also be automatically added to the order. Ancillary supply kits will not include sharps containers, gloves and bandages. Additional personal protective equipment may be needed depending on vaccination provider site needs.\n\nNote that early in the response, ultra-cold (-60\u00b0C to -80\u00b0C) vaccine (if authorized for use or approved) may be shipped directly from the manufacturer in 975-dose increment. For vaccines that are shipped directly from the manufacturer, a combined kit will be included. This combined kit will include administration supplies, mixing supplies and vials of diluent to prepare the vaccine for use.\n\nIs there training available for health care professionals on COVID-19 vaccine administration?\n\nCDC is developing educational and training materials for health care professionals related to COVID-19 vaccine storage, handling and administration based on ACIP recommendations, the ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization, product information from vaccine manufacturers and results of scientific studies.\n\nData reporting Data reporting\n\nWhat are the reporting requirements that physicians will need to comply with?\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination providers must document vaccine administration in their medical record systems within 24 hours of administration, and use their best efforts to report administration data to the relevant system for the jurisdiction, i.e., Immunization Information System (IIS) as soon as practicable and no later than 72 hours after administration.\n\nAll COVID-19 vaccination providers must report COVID-19 vaccine inventory daily into Vaccines.gov. In some jurisdictions, providers may report vaccine inventory to the jurisdiction's IIS for the jurisdiction to upload into Vaccines.gov. If you have questions about the process for your jurisdiction, please contact your jurisdiction's immunization program.\n\nFor more information, see the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Provider Support page for Data and Reporting.\n\nVaccine safety Vaccine safety\n\nWhat additional steps are being taken to ensure vaccine safety post-authorization?\n\nAfter a vaccine is authorized or approved for use, numerous vaccine safety monitoring systems watch for adverse events. If an unexpected adverse event is identified, experts quickly study it further to assess whether it is a true safety concern. FDA, CDC and other federal partners will use established and new systems to monitor COVID-19 vaccines safety.\n\nVAERS is a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems with vaccines. VAERS can identify \"signals\" that might indicate possible safety problems requiring additional investigation. COVID-19 vaccination providers are required to report the following to VAERS:\n\nVaccine administration errors (whether associated with an adverse event or not)\n\nSerious adverse events (even if they are not sure if the vaccination caused the event)\n\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children or adults\n\nCases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death\n\nPhysicians should encourage patients to participate in V-SAFE. V-SAFE is a new smartphone-based, after-vaccination health checker for people who receive COVID-19 vaccines. V-SAFE will use text messaging and web surveys to check in with vaccine recipients and will also provide telephone follow up to anyone who reports medically important adverse events.\n\nIf a link is found between a side effect and a COVID-19 vaccine, public health officials will take appropriate action by weighing the benefits of the vaccine against its risks to determine if recommendations for using the vaccine should change and continuously monitor and evaluate safety thereafter.\n\nClinical considerations Clinical considerations\n\nWhat are the current clinical considerations for use of the J&J/Janssen vaccine given the risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)?\n\nThere is a plausible causal relationship between J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and a rare and serious adverse event\u2014blood clots with low platelets (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS). However, after reviewing all available safety data, the CDC and FDA recommended resuming use of this vaccine in the United States given that the benefits outweigh the risks. See the updated recommendations from the ACIP.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of TTS?\n\nTTS is rare, occurring at a rate of about 7 per 1 million vaccinated women between 18 and 49 years old. For women 50 years and older and men of all ages, this adverse event is even more rare. For three weeks after receiving the vaccine, physicians and patients should be on the lookout for possible symptoms of a blood clot with low platelets. These include severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision, shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, persistent abdominal pain or petechiae.\n\nWhat is the appropriate clinical course of action if TTS is suspected in a patient following the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nIf TTS is suspected physicians should obtain platelet counts and screen for evidence of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. In patients with a thrombotic event and thrombocytopenia after the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, evaluate initially with a screening PF4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay as would be performed for autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Consultation with a hematologist is strongly recommended. Patients with TTS following receipt of J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine should not be treated with heparin, unless HIT testing is negative. If HIT testing is positive or unable to be performed, non- heparin anticoagulants and high-dose intravenous immune globulin should be strongly considered. Report averse events to VAERS.\n\nFor more information see the CDC Health Alert and guidance from the American Society of Hematology.\n\nWhat allergic reactions are a contraindication to vaccination for COVID-19?\n\nContraindications to COVID-19 vaccines include severe allergic reaction after a previous dose or to a component of the COVID-19 vaccine or immediate allergic reaction of any severity to a previous dose or a known allergy to a component of the vaccine.\n\nPolyethylene glycol (PEG) is an ingredient in mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and polysorbate 80 is an ingredient in J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. PEG and polysorbate are structurally related and cross-reactive hypersensitivity between these compounds may occur. People with a contraindication to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have a precaution to J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and vice versa. Among people who received one mRNA COVID-19 dose but for whom the second dose is contraindicated, consideration may be given to vaccination with J&J/ Janssen COVID-19 vaccine at least 28 days after the mRNA COVID-19 dose.\n\nFor people with these contraindications or precautions, referral to an allergist-immunologist should be considered. For more information see the CDC's Interim Clinical Considerations for COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWhat is the ACIP's position on the vaccination of pregnant or lactating people?\n\nPregnant persons are eligible for and can receive a COVID-19 vaccine. A conversation between the patient and their clinical team, while not required, may assist with decisions about the use of a COVID-19 vaccine. Data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people are limited. Based on current knowledge, experts believe that COVID-19 vaccines are unlikely to pose a risk to the pregnant person or fetus. When making a decision, pregnant people and their physician should consider the level of COVID-19 community transmission, the patient's personal risk of contracting COVID-19, the increased risks of severe COVID-19 to the patient and potential risks to the fetus, the known and potential benefits of vaccination, efficacy of the vaccine, side effects of the vaccine and the limited but growing data about the safety of the vaccine during pregnancy.\n\nClinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people are underway\n\nor planned. Vaccine manufacturers are also following outcomes in people in the clinical trials who became pregnant. Early data from vaccine safety surveillance systems have not identified safety concerns for pregnant people who were vaccinated or for their babies. Most of the pregnancies in these systems are ongoing; additional follow-up is needed, particularly among those vaccinated in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy.\n\nFor more information, see the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Practice Advisory for vaccinating pregnant and lactating patients against COVID-19.\n\nWhat is known about the risk of myocarditis in kids following mRNA vaccines?\n\nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Work Group concluded that there are relatively few reports of myocarditis to date and the cases are occurring predominately in adolescents and young adults; more often in males than females, more often following an individual's second dose and typically within four days after vaccination. Most cases appear to be mild. Within CDC safety monitoring systems, rates of myocarditis reports in the window following COVID-19 vaccination have not differed from expected baseline rates. However, information is being collected and reviewed on potential myocarditis cases that were reported into VAERS.\n\nFor more information, see the CDC's Clinical Considerations for Myocarditis and Pericarditis after Receipt of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Among Adolescents and Young Adults.\n\nWhat is the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in immunocompromised patients?\n\nImmunocompromised people can receive COVID-19 vaccination. People with immunocompromising conditions or who take immunosuppressive medications might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19. While no data are available to establish COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy in these groups, currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines are not live vaccines and therefore can be safely administered to immunocompromised people.\n\nBased on general best practices for vaccination of immunocompromised people, ideally COVID-19 vaccination should be completed at least two weeks before initiation of immunosuppressive therapies. When it is not possible to administer a complete COVID-19 vaccination series (i.e., two doses of an mRNA vaccine or a single dose of J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine) in advance, people on immunosuppressive therapy can still receive COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nPeople should be counseled about the potential for reduced immune responses and the need to continue to follow current guidance to protect themselves against COVID-19.\n\nCan COVID-19 vaccines be co-administered with other vaccines?\n\nData are not currently available for COVID-19 vaccines administered simultaneously with other vaccines. However, extensive experience with non-COVID-19 vaccines has demonstrated that immunogenicity and adverse event profiles are generally similar when vaccines are administered simultaneously as when they are administered alone. As a result, the CDC has indicated that COVID-19 vaccines may be administered along with other vaccines without regard to timing. If multiple vaccines are administered in a single visit, each vaccine should be administered in a different injection site. The deltoid muscle can be used for more than one intramuscular injection.\n\nBuilding vaccine confidence Building vaccine confidence\n\nHow can I best prepare to address patient questions about COVID-19 vaccines?\n\nCOVI-19 vaccines are new and questions from patients should be expected. Physicians are one of the most trusted sources of information for their patients on vaccines. Providing a strong recommendation is critical for vaccine acceptance. Physicians can share the importance of vaccines in protecting individual patient health as well as the health of loved ones or even discuss your personal plans as a health care professional to get vaccinated.\n\nExamples:",

The AMA has been urging the administration to increase the vaccine distribution to physician offices and this is a good first step.\n\nVaccine administration Vaccine administration\n\nWhat do physicians need to do to be eligible to administer COVID-19 vaccines?\n\nTo receive and administer COVID-19 vaccine and ancillary supplies, vaccination providers must enroll in the federal government COVID-19 Vaccination Program, coordinated through their jurisdiction's immunization program, by signing and agreeing to conditions outlined in the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement. CDC will make this agreement available to each jurisdiction's immunization program for use in conducting outreach and enrolling vaccination providers. Physicians should reach out to their state health department to enroll.\n\nWhat vaccine storage and handling requirements do physicians need to be aware of?\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination providers should refer to the \"EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers\" and manufacturer information for detailed storage and handling information for each vaccine. Most vaccine products will be provided in a two-dose series and some vaccine products will require special storage and handling (e.g., ultra-cold storage).\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine providers are required to:\n\nStore and handle COVID-19 vaccines under proper conditions, including maintaining cold chain conditions and chain of custody at all times in accordance with an EUA or vaccine package insert, manufacturer guidance and CDC guidance.\n\nMonitor storage unit temperatures at all times, using equipment and practices that comply with guidance in the CDC vaccine storage and handling toolkit.\n\nComply with immunization program guidance for handling temperature excursions.\n\nMonitor and comply with COVID-19 vaccine expiration dates.\n\nPreserve all records related to COVID-19 vaccine management for a minimum of three years.\n\nComply with federal instructions and timelines for disposing of COVID-19 vaccine and diluent, including unused doses.\n\nWhat will be included in the vaccine ancillary supply kits?\n\nAncillary supply kits will include needles, syringes, alcohol prep pads, COVID-19 vaccination record cards for each vaccine recipient and a minimal supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), including surgical masks and face shields, for vaccinators. Each kit that is centrally distributed by the CDC will include supplies needed to administer 100 doses of vaccine.\n\nNeedles, 105 per kit (various sizes for the population served by the ordering vaccination provider) 25-gauge, 1\" (if vaccination indicated for pediatric population) 22\u201325-gauge, 1-1.5\" (adult)\n\nSyringes, 105 per kit (ranging from 1\u20133 mL)\n\nAlcohol prep pads, 210 per kit\n\nFour surgical masks and two face shields for vaccinators per kit\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination record cards for vaccine recipients, 100 per kit\n\nVaccine needle guide detailing the appropriate length/gauge for injections based on route, age (for children), gender and weight (for adults)\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine development Get reliable information on developments in the authorization, distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Learn More\n\nIf a COVID-19 vaccine that requires mixing with diluent is ordered and shipped from CDC's centralized distributor, a mixing kit that includes the necessary needles, syringes and alcohol prep pads will also be automatically added to the order. Ancillary supply kits will not include sharps containers, gloves and bandages. Additional personal protective equipment may be needed depending on vaccination provider site needs.\n\nNote that early in the response, ultra-cold (-60\u00b0C to -80\u00b0C) vaccine (if authorized for use or approved) may be shipped directly from the manufacturer in 975-dose increment. For vaccines that are shipped directly from the manufacturer, a combined kit will be included. This combined kit will include administration supplies, mixing supplies and vials of diluent to prepare the vaccine for use.\n\nIs there training available for health care professionals on COVID-19 vaccine administration?\n\nCDC is developing educational and training materials for health care professionals related to COVID-19 vaccine storage, handling and administration based on ACIP recommendations, the ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization, product information from vaccine manufacturers and results of scientific studies.\n\nData reporting Data reporting\n\nWhat are the reporting requirements that physicians will need to comply with?\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination providers must document vaccine administration in their medical record systems within 24 hours of administration, and use their best efforts to report administration data to the relevant system for the jurisdiction, i.e., Immunization Information System (IIS) as soon as practicable and no later than 72 hours after administration.\n\nAll COVID-19 vaccination providers must report COVID-19 vaccine inventory daily into Vaccines.gov. In some jurisdictions, providers may report vaccine inventory to the jurisdiction's IIS for the jurisdiction to upload into Vaccines.gov. If you have questions about the process for your jurisdiction, please contact your jurisdiction's immunization program.\n\nFor more information, see the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Provider Support page for Data and Reporting.\n\nVaccine safety Vaccine safety\n\nWhat additional steps are being taken to ensure vaccine safety post-authorization?\n\nAfter a vaccine is authorized or approved for use, numerous vaccine safety monitoring systems watch for adverse events. If an unexpected adverse event is identified, experts quickly study it further to assess whether it is a true safety concern. FDA, CDC and other federal partners will use established and new systems to monitor COVID-19 vaccines safety.\n\nVAERS is a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems with vaccines. VAERS can identify \"signals\" that might indicate possible safety problems requiring additional investigation. COVID-19 vaccination providers are required to report the following to VAERS:\n\nVaccine administration errors (whether associated with an adverse event or not)\n\nSerious adverse events (even if they are not sure if the vaccination caused the event)\n\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children or adults\n\nCases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death\n\nPhysicians should encourage patients to participate in V-SAFE. V-SAFE is a new smartphone-based, after-vaccination health checker for people who receive COVID-19 vaccines. V-SAFE will use text messaging and web surveys to check in with vaccine recipients and will also provide telephone follow up to anyone who reports medically important adverse events.\n\nIf a link is found between a side effect and a COVID-19 vaccine, public health officials will take appropriate action by weighing the benefits of the vaccine against its risks to determine if recommendations for using the vaccine should change and continuously monitor and evaluate safety thereafter.\n\nClinical considerations Clinical considerations\n\nWhat are the current clinical considerations for use of the J&J/Janssen vaccine given the risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)?\n\nThere is a plausible causal relationship between J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and a rare and serious adverse event\u2014blood clots with low platelets (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS). However, after reviewing all available safety data, the CDC and FDA recommended resuming use of this vaccine in the United States given that the benefits outweigh the risks. See the updated recommendations from the ACIP.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of TTS?\n\nTTS is rare, occurring at a rate of about 7 per 1 million vaccinated women between 18 and 49 years old. For women 50 years and older and men of all ages, this adverse event is even more rare. For three weeks after receiving the vaccine, physicians and patients should be on the lookout for possible symptoms of a blood clot with low platelets. These include severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision, shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, persistent abdominal pain or petechiae.\n\nWhat is the appropriate clinical course of action if TTS is suspected in a patient following the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nIf TTS is suspected physicians should obtain platelet counts and screen for evidence of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. In patients with a thrombotic event and thrombocytopenia after the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, evaluate initially with a screening PF4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay as would be performed for autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Consultation with a hematologist is strongly recommended. Patients with TTS following receipt of J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine should not be treated with heparin, unless HIT testing is negative. If HIT testing is positive or unable to be performed, non- heparin anticoagulants and high-dose intravenous immune globulin should be strongly considered. Report averse events to VAERS.\n\nFor more information see the CDC Health Alert and guidance from the American Society of Hematology.\n\nWhat allergic reactions are a contraindication to vaccination for COVID-19?\n\nContraindications to COVID-19 vaccines include severe allergic reaction after a previous dose or to a component of the COVID-19 vaccine or immediate allergic reaction of any severity to a previous dose or a known allergy to a component of the vaccine.\n\nPolyethylene glycol (PEG) is an ingredient in mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and polysorbate 80 is an ingredient in J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. PEG and polysorbate are structurally related and cross-reactive hypersensitivity between these compounds may occur. People with a contraindication to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have a precaution to J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and vice versa. Among people who received one mRNA COVID-19 dose but for whom the second dose is contraindicated, consideration may be given to vaccination with J&J/ Janssen COVID-19 vaccine at least 28 days after the mRNA COVID-19 dose.\n\nFor people with these contraindications or precautions, referral to an allergist-immunologist should be considered. For more information see the CDC's Interim Clinical Considerations for COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWhat is the ACIP's position on the vaccination of pregnant or lactating people?\n\nPregnant persons are eligible for and can receive a COVID-19 vaccine. A conversation between the patient and their clinical team, while not required, may assist with decisions about the use of a COVID-19 vaccine. Data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people are limited. Based on current knowledge, experts believe that COVID-19 vaccines are unlikely to pose a risk to the pregnant person or fetus. When making a decision, pregnant people and their physician should consider the level of COVID-19 community transmission, the patient's personal risk of contracting COVID-19, the increased risks of severe COVID-19 to the patient and potential risks to the fetus, the known and potential benefits of vaccination, efficacy of the vaccine, side effects of the vaccine and the limited but growing data about the safety of the vaccine during pregnancy.\n\nClinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people are underway\n\nor planned. Vaccine manufacturers are also following outcomes in people in the clinical trials who became pregnant. Early data from vaccine safety surveillance systems have not identified safety concerns for pregnant people who were vaccinated or for their babies. Most of the pregnancies in these systems are ongoing; additional follow-up is needed, particularly among those vaccinated in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy.\n\nFor more information, see the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Practice Advisory for vaccinating pregnant and lactating patients against COVID-19.\n\nWhat is known about the risk of myocarditis in kids following mRNA vaccines?\n\nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Work Group concluded that there are relatively few reports of myocarditis to date and the cases are occurring predominately in adolescents and young adults; more often in males than females, more often following an individual's second dose and typically within four days after vaccination. Most cases appear to be mild. Within CDC safety monitoring systems, rates of myocarditis reports in the window following COVID-19 vaccination have not differed from expected baseline rates. However, information is being collected and reviewed on potential myocarditis cases that were reported into VAERS.\n\nFor more information, see the CDC's Clinical Considerations for Myocarditis and Pericarditis after Receipt of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Among Adolescents and Young Adults.\n\nWhat is the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in immunocompromised patients?\n\nImmunocompromised people can receive COVID-19 vaccination. People with immunocompromising conditions or who take immunosuppressive medications might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19. While no data are available to establish COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy in these groups, currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines are not live vaccines and therefore can be safely administered to immunocompromised people.\n\nBased on general best practices for vaccination of immunocompromised people, ideally COVID-19 vaccination should be completed at least two weeks before initiation of immunosuppressive therapies. When it is not possible to administer a complete COVID-19 vaccination series (i.e., two doses of an mRNA vaccine or a single dose of J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine) in advance, people on immunosuppressive therapy can still receive COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nPeople should be counseled about the potential for reduced immune responses and the need to continue to follow current guidance to protect themselves against COVID-19.\n\nCan COVID-19 vaccines be co-administered with other vaccines?\n\nData are not currently available for COVID-19 vaccines administered simultaneously with other vaccines. However, extensive experience with non-COVID-19 vaccines has demonstrated that immunogenicity and adverse event profiles are generally similar when vaccines are administered simultaneously as when they are administered alone. As a result, the CDC has indicated that COVID-19 vaccines may be administered along with other vaccines without regard to timing. If multiple vaccines are administered in a single visit, each vaccine should be administered in a different injection site. The deltoid muscle can be used for more than one intramuscular injection.\n\nBuilding vaccine confidence Building vaccine confidence\n\nHow can I best prepare to address patient questions about COVID-19 vaccines?\n\nCOVI-19 vaccines are new and questions from patients should be expected. Physicians are one of the most trusted sources of information for their patients on vaccines. Providing a strong recommendation is critical for vaccine acceptance. Physicians can share the importance of vaccines in protecting individual patient health as well as the health of loved ones or even discuss your personal plans as a health care professional to get vaccinated.\n\nExamples:",

        "Since its emergence, the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a significant increase in COVID-19 cases. This rise in COVID-19 cases has strained hospitals and emergency departments across the United States, increasing the demand for treatments. While there is an ongoing need for people to get vaccinated\u2014and boosted\u2014against COVID-19, two antiviral oral treatments are available in limited supplies, but patient confusion still remains about who is eligible and how these treatments work.\n\nWhat you need to know about COVID-19 Explore top articles, videos, research highlights and more from the AMA\u2014your source for clear, evidence-based news and guidance during the pandemic. See the Latest Updates\n\nLast month, the two oral antivirals\u2014Paxlovid (PDF) and molnupiravir (PDF)\u2014were authorized for outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 under emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Treatment with these oral antivirals must begin within five days of symptom onset to maintain product efficacy. Learn what COVID-19 treatments are FDA authorized, and what works.\n\nThe AMA\u2019s What Doctors Wish Patients Knew\u2122 series provides physicians with a platform to share what they want patients to understand about today\u2019s health care headlines, especially throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn this installment, AMA member Elisa Choi, MD, an internist and infectious disease specialist, discusses what patients need to know about COVID-19 antiviral pills.\n\nThere are two options There are two options\n\n\u201cThe first one is a combination of pills more commonly known Paxlovid,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of nirmatrelvir tablets and a pharmacologic boosting pill called ritonavir.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere's also a second pill called molnupiravir,\u201d she added, noting that when this antiviral enters the bloodstream, it blocks the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to replicate.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Paxlovid, it is currently authorized for use in all adult patients and in pediatric patients who are 12 years or older who weigh at least 88 pounds,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cMolnupiravir is only authorized in adult patients who are 18 or older because molnupiravir has potential to affect bone and cartilage growth, which can be detrimental to the pediatric population.\u201d\n\nThey prevent hospitalization or death They prevent hospitalization or death\n\nWhile data is still limited, \u201cin one study that was cited in the EUA, Paxlovid was found to reduce the proportion of people with COVID-19 related hospital admission or death by about 88% compared to the placebo treatment arm,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cAnd that is for those patients who received the treatment within five days of the onset of symptoms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe second medication, molnupiravir, has a lower efficacy rate compared to Paxlovid,\u201d she said. \u201cThe rate of reduced hospitalization or death was about 30% compared to the placebo group.\u201d\n\nThe pills are not for pre-exposure The pills are not for pre-exposure\n\n\u201cBoth of these oral antivirals are used only for treatment of patients who have confirmed COVID-19 infection,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cThese are not for any prophylaxis\u2014either as a pre-exposure or post-exposure\u2014and are only for treatment of symptoms.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven with COVID-19 infection, the EUA for these two medications really only covers those who are non-hospitalized, symptomatic adults who have mild to moderate COVID-19 illness\u201d and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, she said.\n\nRelated Coverage What physicians need to know about COVID-19 clinical therapeutics\n\nSevere COVID-19 needs different care Severe COVID-19 needs different care\n\n\u201cThe studies were looking at patients who were considered mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms,\u201d said Dr. Choi, adding that \u201cif a patient has severe COVID symptoms, they probably will need a higher level of care.\u201d\n\n\u201cPaxlovid and molnupiravir are not indicated for somebody who has severe COVID-19 as these medications are intended for outpatient care,\u201d she said. For those with severe COVID-19 infection, \u201cthey likely will need oxygen support or more intense clinical monitoring.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy necessity, those patients with severe COVID-19 infection will need a high level of care that will likely require hospital admission and would not be managed as outpatients,\u201d Dr. Choi added.\n\nPaxlovid is three tablets Paxlovid is three tablets\n\nAs a combination of pills, Paxlovid \u201ccomes as both nirmatrelvir and ritonavir tablets,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cFor a full dose of Paxlovid, it would be two tables of nirmatrelvir, which would equal a total of 300 milligrams taken together with one tablet of ritonavir.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be three tablets total and they would be taken by mouth two times a day for a total duration of five days,\u201d she said, noting that \u201chopefully when people review the prescriptions, the directions are clear about that because many people may not be used to taking a medication in combination with a pharmacologic booster pill, which is what Paxlovid is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ritonavir is acting as a pharmacologic boosting medication for the nirmatrelvir,\u201d Dr. Choi added.\n\nMolnupiravir is four capsules Molnupiravir is four capsules\n\n\u201cThe second antiviral, molnupiravir, is a dose of 800 milligrams total,\u201d said Dr. Choi. That means a patient is taking \u201cfour capsules of 200 milligrams each.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor molnupiravir, the four capsules are taken by mouth every 12 hours or twice a day for five days and not longer,\u201d she said.\n\nSome side effects are expected Some side effects are expected\n\n\u201cWhat appears to be the most common side effects with Paxlovid are altered taste or potentially loss of taste,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cThere also is the gastrointestinal side effect of diarrhea, and there can be myalgia, which means muscle aches.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor molnupiravir, similarly it does have some gastrointestinal side effects, namely diarrhea and nausea as well as some reported adverse side effects of dizziness.\u201d\n\nShare what medications you\u2019re taking Share what medications you\u2019re taking\n\n\u201cPaxlovid, because it has that boosting medication ritonavir as one of its components, creates potential drug interactions,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cFor anybody who receives a prescription for Paxlovid, they should make sure that their physician reviews all of the patient\u2019s other medications that they are taking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat includes over-the-counter medications and supplements or other non-prescription medications that they take, to check for any drug interactions,\u201d she added, noting \u201cit\u2019s easiest to do that through certain drug interaction tools for which physicians will have access.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany patients don\u2019t think to mention medications that they\u2019re taking that are non-prescription or that may be supplements, but everything should be mentioned to their physicians,\u201d said Dr. Choi.\n\nSupplies are limited Supplies are limited\n\n\u201cThe demand is just outstripping the supply for these oral antivirals right now due to the quickly spreading Omicron variant of COVID-19,\u201d said Dr. Choi, noting that \u201cmost of the access for these medications are being directed by the state health departments to specific local health departments, pharmacies, clinics, hospitals and physician offices.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot all physicians will be able to get these medications on demand for their patients\u2014there\u2019s a lot of state-to-state variability,\u201d she said.\n\nConsult your doctor if pregnant Consult your doctor if pregnant\n\n\u201cMolnupiravir is not recommended for use during pregnancy because of a potential for fetal harm in pregnant persons,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cThe nuance there, though, is if the patient\u2019s physician has determined that the benefit of being treated with the molnupiravir would outweigh the risk for the patient, then there ought to be a discussion of the potential benefits versus the potential risks, of taking this medication in the pregnant patient with COVID-19 infection.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile molnupiravir is generally not recommended during pregnancy, this is an evolving area and treatments for COVID-19 infection are limited,\u201d she added. \u201cThere needs to be good communication about the risks and benefits of molnupiravir, with clear documentation by the physician that those risks and benefits were discussed with the patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Paxlovid, at this juncture, there isn\u2019t that same prohibition against use in pregnancy,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cPatients who are pregnant should, regardless, discuss the risks and benefits of any treatments for COVID-19 infection with their physicians so that the currently available evidence can be discussed.\u201d\n\nNot everyone should take these pills Not everyone should take these pills\n\n\u201cFor patients who are younger than 18, molnupiravir is not authorized at this point and should not be considered as a therapeutic option for pediatric patients with mild to moderate COVID-19,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cPediatric patients under the age of 12 or who weigh less than 88 pounds should not be prescribed Paxlovid.\u201d\n\n\u201cOther groups of patients who will need to be careful about using these antivirals are those who have severe liver impairment or liver disease,\u201d she said. \u201cThe other caution is for people who have severe kidney disease, at least until more medical data and evidence are acquired.\u201d\n\nGet vaccinated and boosted Get vaccinated and boosted\n\n\u201cI can't stress enough that these oral antivirals are not a substitute for getting a COVID-19 vaccine. We have so much more vaccine available than antivirals, currently, and prevention is always preferable to treatment,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cIf people haven't been fully COVID-19 vaccinated, they need to get up to date with their COVID-19 vaccines,\u201d which means two doses of a mRNA vaccine and a booster shot..\n\n\u201cIf they have received the primary series of COVID-19 vaccine but have not received their COVID-19 booster vaccine, they need to get their booster dose\u201d when eligible,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are the first steps to take, even before thinking about anything related to the antivirals because the vaccines work and are very safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 vaccines and boosters work against the Omicron variant, and they will help prevent a person who gets infected with COVID-19 from suffering severe enough illness that they will need hospitalization, or\u2014worst case\u2014die,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cIn no way are these antivirals a substitute for the biggest priority right now, which is getting as many people vaccinated and boosted as completely as possible against COVID-19.\u201d\n\nVisit the AMA COVID-19 resource center for clinical information, guides and resources, and updates on advocacy and medical ethics.",

        "Highly pathogenic coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1,2, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)3, and SARS-CoV-14 vary in their transmissibility and pathogenicity. However, infection by all three viruses results in substantial apoptosis in cell culture5-7 and in patient tissues8-10, suggesting a potential link between apoptosis and pathogenesis of coronaviruses. Here we show that a cysteine-aspartic protease of the apoptosis cascade, caspase-6, serves as an important host factor for efficient coronavirus replication. We demonstrate that caspase-6 cleaves coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) proteins, generating N fragments that serve as interferon (IFN) antagonists, thus facilitating virus replication. Inhibition of caspase-6 substantially attenuates lung pathology and body weight loss of SARS-CoV-2-infected golden Syrian hamsters and improves the survival of mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (MERS-CoV MA )-infected human DPP4 knock-in (hDPP4 KI) mice. Overall, our study reveals how coronaviruses exploit a component of the host apoptosis cascade to facilitate virus replication.",

        "Some studies suggest that the risk of cardiovascular problems, such as a heart attack or stroke, remains high even many months after a SARS-CoV-2 infection clears up. Researchers are starting to pin down the frequency of these issues and what is causing the damage.\n\nAdapted from Yukon Haughton by Nik Spencer/Nature\n\nIn December 2020, a week before cardiologist Stuart Katz was scheduled to receive his first COVID-19 vaccine, he came down with a fever. He spent the next two weeks wracked with a cough, body aches and chills. After months of helping others to weather the pandemic, Katz, who works at New York University, was having his own first-hand experience of COVID-19.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Katz\u2019s acute illness finally subsided. But many symptoms lingered, including some related to the organ he\u2019s built his career around: the heart. Walking up two flights of stairs would leave him breathless, with his heart racing at 120 beats per minute. Over the next several months, he began to feel better, and he\u2019s now back to his normal routine of walking and cycling. But reports about COVID-19\u2019s effects on the cardiovascular system have made him concerned about his long-term health. \u201cI say to myself, \u2018Well, is it really over?\u2019\u201d Katz says.\n\nIn one study1 this year, researchers used records from the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to estimate how often COVID-19 leads to cardiovascular problems. They found that people who had had the disease faced substantially increased risks for 20 cardiovascular conditions \u2014 including potentially catastrophic problems such as heart attacks and strokes \u2014 in the year after infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Researchers say that these complications can happen even in people who seem to have completely recovered from a mild infection.\n\nSome smaller studies have mirrored these findings, but others find lower rates of complications. With millions or perhaps even billions of people having been infected with SARS-CoV-2, clinicians are wondering whether the pandemic will be followed by a cardiovascular aftershock. Meanwhile, researchers are trying to understand who is most at risk of these heart-related problems, how long the risk persists and what causes these symptoms.\n\nIt\u2019s a gaping hole in an important area of public health, says Katz. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand if this changes the lifelong trajectory for risk of a heart attack or stroke or other cardiac events \u2014 we just don\u2019t know that.\u201d Here, Nature looks at the questions that scientists are asking and the answers they\u2019ve uncovered so far.\n\nHow many people are at risk?\n\nDoctors have reported cardiovascular problems related to COVID-19 throughout the pandemic, but concerns over this issue surged after the results of the VA study came out earlier this year. The analysis by Ziyad Al-Aly, an epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, and his colleagues is one of the most extensive efforts to characterize what happens to the heart and circulatory system after the acute phase of COVID-19. The researchers compared more than 150,000 veterans who had recovered from acute COVID-19 with their uninfected peers, as well as with a pre-pandemic control group1.\n\nPeople who had been admitted to intensive care with acute infections had a drastically higher risk of cardiovascular problems during the next year (see \u2018Cardiac concerns\u2019). For some conditions, such as swelling of the heart and blood clots in the lungs, the risk shot up at least 20-fold compared with that in uninfected peers. But even people who had not been hospitalized had increased risks of many conditions, ranging from an 8% increase in the rate of heart attacks to a 247% increase in the rate of heart inflammation.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nFor Al-Aly, the study added to the growing body of evidence that a bout of COVID-19 can permanently alter some people\u2019s health. These kinds of change fall under the category of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, which covers problems that emerge after an initial infection. This disorder includes \u2014 and overlaps with \u2014 the persistent condition known as long COVID, a term that has many definitions.\n\nStudies indicate that the coronavirus is associated with a wide range of lasting problems, such as diabetes2, persistent lung damage3 and even brain damage4. As with these conditions, Al-Aly says that the cardiovascular issues that occur after a SARS-CoV-2 infection can decrease a person\u2019s quality of life over the long term. Treatments do exist for these problems, \u201cbut they are not curable conditions\u201d, he adds.\n\nDespite its large size, the VA study does come with caveats, say researchers. The study is observational, meaning that it reuses data that were collected for other purposes \u2014 a method that can introduce biases. For example, the study considers only veterans, meaning that the data are skewed towards white men. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have any study like it that goes into more diverse and a younger population,\u201d says Eric Topol, a genomicist at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California. He thinks that more research is needed before scientists can truly quantify the frequency at which cardiovascular problems strike.\n\nDaniel Tancredi, a medical statistician at the University of California, Davis, points out another potential source of bias. One of the control groups in the VA study had to get through more than a year without catching SARS-CoV-2 to be included in the study. There could be physiological differences that made the control group less likely to contract the disease, which could also affect their susceptibility to cardiovascular problems. Still, Tancredi thinks the study was well designed and that any bias is likely to be minimal. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that these numbers are exactly right, but they\u2019re definitely in the ballpark,\u201d he says. He hopes future prospective studies will fine-tune Al-Aly\u2019s estimates.\n\nSome other studies do point in the same direction. Data from the England\u2019s health-care system5, for example, show that people who had been hospitalized with COVID-19 were about three times more likely than uninfected people to face major cardiovascular problems within eight months of their hospitalization. A second study6 found that, in the 4 months after infection, people who had had COVID-19 had a roughly 2.5-fold increased risk of congestive heart failure compared with those who had not been infected.\n\nHealth modeller Sarah Wulf Hanson at the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle used Al-Aly\u2019s data to estimate how many heart attacks and strokes COVID-19 has been associated with. Her unpublished work suggests that, in 2020, complications after COVID-19 caused 12,000 extra strokes and 44,000 extra heart attacks in the United States, numbers that jumped up to 18,000 strokes and 66,000 heart attacks in 2021. This means that COVID-19 could have increased the rates of heart attack by about 8% and of stroke by about 2%. \u201cIt is sobering,\u201d Wulf Hanson says.\n\nIndirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as missed medical appointments, stress and the sedentary nature of isolating at home probably further contributed to the cardiovascular burden for many people, scientists suggest.\n\nThese numbers don\u2019t match what some researchers have seen in the clinic, however. In a small study7 of 52 people, Gerry McCann, a cardiac-imaging specialist at the University of Leicester, UK, and his colleagues found that people who had recovered after being hospitalized with COVID-19 had no greater rate of heart disease than did a group of people who had similar underlying conditions but remained uninfected. The trial was orders of magnitude smaller than Al-Aly\u2019s, but McCann and his colleagues are working on a larger study with around 1,200 participants. The results have yet to be published, but McCann says \u201cthe more data we\u2019re acquiring, the less impressed we are with the degree of, let\u2019s say, myocardial injury\u201d, or heart problems.\n\nDespite having an incomplete picture of COVID-19\u2019s cardiovascular effects, doctors recommend caution. An expert panel convened by the American College of Cardiology advises doctors to test people who have had COVID-19 for cardiovascular problems if they have risk factors such as being older or immunosuppressed8.\n\nHow are researchers gathering more information?\n\nAnswers to many questions about the long-term impacts of COVID-19 could come from a large study called the Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery, or RECOVER, project, which aims to follow 60,000 people for up to 4 years at more than 200 sites in the United States. The study will include participants with long COVID, people who were infected and have recovered, and others who were never infected. \u201cIt\u2019s enrolling across the lifespan,\u201d says Katz, who is the principal investigator of the trial. He and his colleagues plan to study children, adults, pregnant people and the infants who are born during the trial.\n\nMost RECOVER participants will fill out questionnaires about their health and undergo non-invasive tests. Researchers aim to collect extra information for about 20% of participants, for example, by temporarily inserting small tubes into adults\u2019 hearts to obtain localized measurements of indicators such as blood pressure and oxygen levels. After several years, scientists hope to have completed a catalogue of long-COVID symptoms, formed an understanding of who develops them and begun to understand why they occur.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, McCann leads the cardiovascular working group for a similar project called the Post-hospitalization COVID-19 study, or PHOSP-COVID. This multi-centre study focuses on people who were hospitalized with COVID-19, and aims to uncover the prevalence of lasting symptoms, who is most at risk and how the virus causes lingering health problems. Thus far, the group has found that only about one-quarter of people who were hospitalized feel fully recovered one year after infection. And the team has identified immune markers that are associated with the worst cases of long COVID9.\n\nHow does the virus harm the heart?\n\nCOVID-19\u2019s effect on the heart could be related to the key protein that the virus uses to enter cells. It binds to a protein called ACE2, which can be found on the surfaces of dozens of types of human cell. This, says Al-Aly, gives it \u201caccess and permission to enter almost any cell in the body\u201d.\n\nWhen the virus enters the endothelial cells that line blood vessels, Topol says, that\u2019s probably where many cardiovascular problems start. Blood clots form naturally to heal damage caused while the body clears the infection. These clots can clog blood vessels, leading to damage as minor as leg pain or as severe as a heart attack. A study10 based on more than 500,000 COVID-19 cases found that people who had been infected had a 167% higher risk of developing a blood clot in the two weeks after infection than people who had had influenza. Robert Harrington, a cardiologist at Stanford University in California, says that even after the initial infection, plaques can accumulate where the immune response has damaged the lining of blood vessels, causing the vessels to narrow. This can lead to problems, such as heart attacks and strokes, even months after the initial wound has healed. \u201cThose early complications can definitely translate into later complications,\u201d Harrington says.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 could also leave its fingerprints on the immune system. When Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, and her colleagues characterized antibodies from hospitalized people during the acute phase of COVID-19, they found a plethora of antibodies against human tissue11. Iwasaki suspects that when SARS-CoV-2 ramps up someone\u2019s immune system, it might inadvertently activate immune cells that attack the body \u2014 cells that stay quiet when the immune system isn\u2019t in overdrive. These immune cells could damage many organs, including the heart.\n\nDamage to blood vessels can compound attacks on the immune system. \u201cYou can think of this damage as accumulating over time,\u201d says Iwasaki. When the cardiovascular system has been assaulted on enough fronts, that\u2019s when people can experience serious consequences, such as a stroke or heart attack.\n\nWhat about reinfection and new variants?\n\nVaccinations, reinfections and the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 all pose new questions about the virus\u2019s cardiovascular effects. A paper published in May by Al-Aly and his colleagues suggests that vaccination reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of developing these long-term problems12.\n\nHanson is also eager to model whether reinfections compound the risk and whether the relatively mild \u2014 but widespread \u2014 Omicron variant will affect the cardiovascular system as drastically as other variants. \u201cWe are kind of chomping at the bit for follow-up data among Omicron cases,\u201d she says.",
        "NEWS AND VIEWS\n\n03 August 2022 Genetic variants that edit risk of autoimmune diseases A process called A-to-I RNA editing helps to prevent unwanted immune responses. Associations between genetic variants and this type of RNA editing now provide mechanistic insights into the genetic basis of autoimmune diseases. Kaur Alasoo 0 Kaur Alasoo Kaur Alasoo is at the Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, 51009 Tartu, Estonia. View author publications You can also search for this author in PubMed Google Scholar\n\nThe genetic variants that increase the risk of disease do so by exerting effects on RNA. Variants can alter the amount of RNA produced from a given gene. They can alter the transcribed RNA sequence itself, leading to changes either in the amino-acid sequence of the encoded protein or in how much of the RNA is removed through \u2018splicing\u2019 before it is translated into protein. Finally, variants can influence whether RNA molecules undergo A-to-I RNA editing1 \u2014 a process in which a subunit of RNA is changed from adenosine (A) to inosine (I). Writing in Nature, Li et al.2 present a comprehensive analysis of the effects of genetic variants on A-to-I RNA editing. Their work provides new insights into the mechanisms by which genetic variants mediate the risk of some immune-related diseases.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-01641-y\n\nReferences Eisenberg, E. & Levanon, E.

        "From London to Shanghai, unprecedented heatwaves have scorched many parts of the world in recent weeks. In June, Tokyo baked through nine consecutive days above 35 \u00baC, its most severe heatwave since official tallies began in the 1870s. In mid-July, the United Kingdom shattered records as temperatures soared above 40 \u00baC for the first time since measurements started. Meanwhile, heat-fuelled wildfires ravaged parts of France, Spain, Greece and Germany. And China has faced multiple widespread heatwaves, including one that hit more than 400 cities last week.\n\nClimate scientists have long warned that heatwaves will strike more frequently and with higher temperatures as the world warms. But the future has arrived faster than researchers had feared, particularly in Western Europe, which is a hotspot for heatwaves, according to research published last month1. These aren\u2019t just more and more-powerful heatwaves \u2014 they are record-shattering heatwaves that have defied expectations derived from climate models.\n\nResearchers are now scrambling to dissect the details of this year\u2019s heatwaves, to better understand how extreme heat will affect society going forwards.\n\n\u201cThe science community has obviously been thinking about the possibility of these events,\u201d says Eunice Lo, a climate scientist at the University of Bristol, UK, who has studied the UK heatwave. But \u201cit was still quite surreal that it actually happened\u201d.\n\nLethal heat\n\nExtreme heat is one of the more deadly consequences of global warming. It kills people directly, such as those working outdoors. And it overloads energy grids, disrupting electricity supplies at times when people most need air conditioning or fans to survive in overheated homes. A heatwave in Europe in 2003 is estimated to have killed more than 70,000 people. And heatwaves can also exacerbate other disasters, such as wildfires, and exact a high toll on mental health.\n\nAlthough heatwaves have been getting worse in the past few years, studies of the most extreme examples leapt forward after a June 2021 heatwave in the Pacific Northwest region of North America.\n\nThat heatwave was so far off the charts that it essentially reset the field of research on extreme heat, says Vikki Thompson, a climate scientist at Bristol. In a study published in May, she and her colleagues showed2 that only five heatwaves recorded anywhere in the world since 1960 had been more extreme, as measured by departure from the climate of the previous decade. Just looking at temperature records across the Pacific Northwest from the years before the event, it seemed \u201ccompletely implausible\u201d that such a record-breaking heatwave could occur, she says. And yet it did \u2014 driven mainly by a high-pressure atmospheric system that funnelled in hot air, combined with drier-than-normal soil conditions across much of the region.\n\nDefying expectations\n\nThis July\u2019s heatwave in the United Kingdom was not quite so severe, but it might still go down in history as the event that shook a nation into awareness of the dangers of extreme heat. On 18 and 19 July, a broad swathe of the country set new temperature records, in many cases a full 3 or 4 \u00baC higher than the previous one (see \u2018Hotter extremes\u2019). Forty-six weather stations broke the nation\u2019s previous record high temperature of 38.7 \u00baC, which was set just three years ago. Hundreds of people are estimated to have died.\n\nScientists had foreseen this to some extent. A climate-modelling study published two years ago found that it was possible, although not likely, that the United Kingdom would pass 40 \u00baC in the coming decades3. And yet it happened this year, with a new national high of 40.3 \u00baC.\n\nThe fact that temperatures topped the threshold so much more quickly than expected might stem from the reality that climate models don\u2019t capture everything that influences heatwaves, and thus don\u2019t project future heat extremes completely accurately4. Changes in factors including land use and irrigation affect heatwaves in ways that models don\u2019t entirely account for yet. That means that model projections can sometimes misjudge the true impact of climate change.\n\nA 28 July analysis by the international World Weather Attribution research group found that human-induced climate change made this year\u2019s UK heatwave at least ten times more likely5. The study also concluded that the heatwave would have been 2\u20134 \u00baC cooler in the absence of global warming.\n\n\u201cIt is more evidence that there are some things we\u2019re probably not catching with the models,\u201d says Peter Stott, a climate scientist at the Met Office, the UK national weather service in Exeter, who was a co-author of the 2020 study about the United Kingdom3. \u201cThere is a research question there.\u201d\n\nLike the Pacific Northwest heatwave of 2021, the UK heatwave of 2022 might become a catalyst for understanding what causes heatwaves to become even more extreme than expected, says Erich Fischer, a climate scientist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. In a modelling study published last year6, Fischer and his colleagues projected that, in the coming decades, climate extremes will break previous records by wide margins. \u201cThis is exactly what we\u2019ve been seeing,\u201d he says.\n\nStudying the extent to which extremes shatter records, and not just whether they pass the mark, can help local officials to plan for the types of extreme they might expect in the near future, Fischer argues.\n\nDynamic change\n\nBeyond the United Kingdom, much of Europe has already experienced several heatwaves this year. In fact, the continent has seen record heat several times over the past five years, says Kai Kornhuber, a climate scientist at Columbia University in New York City. He was part of the team that identified Western Europe as particularly prone to heatwaves1. Over the past four decades, extreme heat has been increasing at rates three to four times faster there than in other mid-latitude regions in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nThat could be because the atmospheric jet stream that flows east across the North Atlantic Ocean often breaks into two separate strands as it approaches Europe. When that happens, the strands can funnel storms away from Europe and allow heatwaves to develop and persist. It isn\u2019t yet clear whether climate change is leading to more of these \u2018double jets\u2019, but that pattern set up this July\u2019s heatwave in Western Europe and is responsible for many of the other recent heat events there.\n\nSimilar patterns of atmospheric dynamics might turn out to be important in revealing the factors that make heat events even more extreme than expected, says Kornhuber.\n\nSynchronized waves\n\nAnother striking feature of the past few months is that extreme heat has occurred simultaneously in several parts of the world (see \u2018In the red\u2019). China and western North America were both roasting in hotter-than-normal temperatures in late July, at the same time as Europe. Such concurrent heatwaves became six times more common in the Northern Hemisphere between 1979 and 2019, a study published in February found7.\n\nOne reason might be atmospheric patterns called Rossby waves that settle into a snaking shape around the entire planet, setting up stagnant patterns of weather in certain locations, which then become prone to extreme heat8. Those might or might not be becoming more common under global warming. But the sheer chance of having simultaneous heatwaves, unrelated to atmospheric patterns, does go up as the climate warms, says Deepti Singh, a climate scientist at Washington State University in Vancouver. \u201cThe entire world is warming, and just the likelihood of having extreme heat regions is increasing,\u201d she says.\n\nHeatwaves are also coming earlier in the year in some places, such as India and Pakistan, which experienced baking temperatures from March to May. Parts of India passed 44 \u00baC at the end of March, well before the usual hottest part of the year. At least 90 people died. The heatwave was made 30 times more likely by climate change, the World Weather Attribution group found9.\n\nAs global temperatures continue to rise, climate scientists are reiterating the importance of both cutting carbon emissions and increasing people\u2019s ability to adapt to extreme temperatures. The UK heatwave was a major wake-up call about the nation\u2019s vulnerability to extreme heat, says Stott. After decades working on climate projections for the future, what startled him most was to see wildfires raging in London\u2019s urban area, fuelled by the extreme heat. \u201cIt was very sobering, really, and shocking that this was happening.\u201d",

        "A glow undetectable to the human eye permeates the universe. This light is the remnant signature of the cosmic beginning \u2014 a dense, hot fireball that burst forth and created all mass, energy, and time. The primordial cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation has since traveled some 13.8 billion years through the expanding cosmos to our telescopes on Earth and above it.\n\nBut the CMB isn\u2019t just light. It holds within it an incredible wealth of knowledge that astronomers have been teasing out for the past few decades. \u201cIt\u2019s the earliest view we have of the universe,\u201d Princeton University cosmologist Joanna Dunkley previously explained to Astronomy. \u201cAnd it gives us so much information because all the things that we now see out in space \u2014 the galaxies, the clusters of galaxies \u2014 the very earliest seeds of those, we see in this CMB light.\u201d\n\nExtracting these clues from the CMB has taken multiple generations of telescopes on the ground, lofted into the atmosphere, and launched into space. In the mid-1960s, when Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered the CMB\u2019s pervasive microwave static across the sky, it appeared identical everywhere. It would take satellites launched above Earth\u2019s obscuring atmosphere to map that microwave glow to precisions on the order of millionths of a degree. Specifically, three satellites \u2014 COBE, WMAP, and Planck \u2014 revealed that our current cosmos, which is complex and filled with clusters of galaxies, stars, planets, and black holes, evolved from a surprisingly simple early universe.\n\nIn this week's episode of Infinity & Beyond, host Abigail Bollenbach will walk you through the basics of the cosmic microwave background, the universe's oldest baby picture.\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest space and astronomy news, and make sure to follow us on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.",

Our recommendations: It is not necessary to implement mask or social distancing mandates at this time. National surveillance systems should track the underlying cause of hospital admissions.\n\n\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nRising COVID-positive hospital admissions in the US\n\nIn some jurisdictions in the US, there are rising reported hospital admissions with COVID, and in some cases, examples of rising deaths. This has caused considerable policy discussion about whether it is time to reinstate mandates, such as the consideration of mask mandates in LA County.\n\nThe challenge that we have in understanding what's happening with BA.5 is that this is a very common infection. We see lots of evidence of considerable transmission in the community that is not translating into a big surge in reported cases, largely because we believe there is so much rapid antigen testing at home.\n\nMany COVID hospitalizations are incidental\n\nWe do see rising numbers of hospital admissions, and the challenge \u2013 as we've spoken about before \u2013 is distinguishing incidental, that is people coming to the hospital with some other problem, who happened to be COVID-positive when they get tested, from true COVID admissions. Unfortunately, in this country we don't have data on COVID admissions where they are positive for COVID and that's the reason for admission. Some hospital systems are reporting this.\n\nThere are reports from USC, for example, in LA County, that fully 90% of hospital admissions are incidental, meaning it is quite possible that we don't have reason to be that concerned about BA.5 transmission.\n\nRead more in Nature \u00bbHeart disease after COVID: what the data say\n\nUnlikely to be many cases of severe COVID\n\nIt could well be, because of high levels of immunity in the population from vaccination and from past infection, and quite widespread use of Paxlovid, if we look at the data in the US, that there isn't really cause for concern that there's going to be a large amount of severe COVID. This means, perhaps, that it is not the time, at this point, to be considering imposition of new mandates such as mask mandates or social distancing mandates.\n\nThe situation globally\n\nThis is a phenomenon we're seeing in other countries as well \u2013 it's not unique to the United States. There are reports from New Zealand, for example, in the last few days, of a marked increase in daily deaths. And again, this challenge is there, as well as in many countries in Europe \u2013 Norway is another example \u2013 where incidental from underlying is not being distinguished. It could well be just that BA.5 is a very common infection.\n\nThe only way we're going to resolve this for the future is if national surveillance systems make the effort to track hospitalizations and distinguish them by the underlying cause of admission.\n\nWe remain reasonably positive and optimistic about the course of BA.5 in the US and elsewhere. We do see early signs that it may have peaked already in the US and is starting to come down \u2013 that's not true for every state, but in general it does seem to be following the course that we've seen in other countries around the world.\n\nJuly 20, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nBA.5 is surging around the world, particularly in North America, Latin America, and Europe. We anticipate waves to last around four to six weeks, based on other locations\u2019 experiences.\n\nparticularly in North America, Latin America, and Europe. There are several new challenges for accurately tracking the pandemic: More people are using at-home tests and not reporting infections to public health authorities, making it difficult to gather accurate case counts. Countries have different requirements for COVID testing upon hospital admission, leading to variation in rates of hospitalization due to COVID, compared to incidental cases.\n\nOur policy recommendations: Encourage booster shots. Make antivirals available to all, particularly those in low-resource settings. High-risk individuals should consider social distancing and masking as transmission increases. Do not focus on getting vaccines to those who have never been vaccinated.\n\n\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nBA.5 surges around the world\n\nIn this week\u2019s COVID update from IHME, we\u2019re looking at the surges around the world \u2013 particularly in North America, Latin America, and most of Europe \u2013 that are traced to the combination of mobility levels being above pre-COVID levels, mask use globally down to 16% or less, and of course the BA.5 subvariant of Omicron.\n\nInterpreting the data has new challenges\n\nIt is becoming increasingly challenging to make complete sense of the COVID-19 surges in different countries, as we see very different biases in different countries coming into reported cases, hospital admissions, and reported deaths.\n\nFor reported cases, we're seeing very modest to no increase in some countries in Europe, as compared to hospitalizations. Same in the United States. And we believe that's because of the widespread use of rapid antigen tests at home and in most countries people not reporting that to the public health authorities. They don't get into official case numbers.\n\nIn contrast, for hospital admissions \u2013 if you want an extreme example of this disconnect, look at Norway, where hospital admissions have gone up dramatically and yet cases have gone up only slightly. But for hospital admissions, most countries have required COVID testing for all patients, at least most high-income countries, meaning that you detect a quite substantial number of individuals who have COVID, but have gone to hospital for some other reason. We tend to call these \"incidental\" COVID admissions.\n\nThe degree to which there will be incidental COVID admissions depends on how much transmission there is broadly in the community. So we should expect under Omicron, the problem of incidental hospital admissions is dramatically larger than with a much more severe variant, such as Delta in the past, where there was less transmission in the community, and those coming to hospital who were COVID-positive were much more likely to be there simply because of symptoms of COVID.\n\nSo, challenging interpretation. And if you want to have a contrast to Norway, look at Mexico, where the increase in reported cases is dramatically higher than the increase in hospital admissions. We don't know if that's because there isn't the same testing requirement, of universal testing for COVID for hospital admissions, or if there is less home use of tests. Either way, it's becoming quite a bit harder to make sense of the available data.\n\nShould we be very concerned about BA.5?\n\nProbably not. In the places that started earlier \u2013 South Africa, Portugal \u2013 that had their BA.5 waves begin before other locations, we've seen from the beginning to the peak, it lasts about four to six weeks. So in many cases where countries are three-four weeks into these surges, we do think that we will see \u2013 and the models tend to back up that observation \u2013 we do expect to see peaks coming in the near future. Meaning that there isn't a reason to be particularly alarmed about BA.5,\n\nOur long-range models also suggest in the Northern Hemisphere that we may \u2013 in the absence of a new variant that changes the whole story \u2013 we might expect to see a further winter or late fall Omicron wave start up again in October, and that would be a pattern that we saw in 2020 and 2021.\n\nWhether that happens depends very much on this balance between waning immunity from prior vaccination \u2013 so whether or not people get a fourth booster in places where they have access to that, whether they want a fourth booster \u2013 versus waning immunity from infection and the protection provided from infection with Omicron for either other subvariants or future variants. All of that means to say that it's possible that we have a late-fall surge again from Omicron because of waning immunity.\n\nGovernment policy recommendations\n\nThe strategies available for governments right now are less on getting people who have never been vaccinated, vaccinated. The data out there suggest very few people anywhere in the world who want to be vaccinated have not been, even in low-resource settings. As opposed to the available strategies, which might focus more on getting those who are willing to be vaccinated, who have been previously vaccinated, getting a further booster to enhance their protection against severe disease as that also wanes over time; broader use of antivirals, particularly in low- and middle-income countries; and then, for those individuals who are at particularly high risk, consideration of social distancing and masking as transmission in your community goes up.\n\nAs a backdrop to all of those strategies, the thing that we are learning, that is, two and a half years into this pandemic, is just how important surveillance is. Paradoxically, in many ways, the data stream that we have today is worse than a year ago because of some of the issues that I started with in this video about home testing, and different definitions of incidental versus underlying COVID for both hospitalization and death. So, very challenging on the surveillance side, but absolutely critical that we keep monitoring the pandemic and trying to do it in as comparable a fashion as possible, and particularly keeping track of new variants. That's our roundup of what we see in our analysis this week in the release of our new forecasts.\n\nJune 24, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nIn the United States , COVID is currently on the decline, but BA.4 and BA.5 could change that. Why? Vaccines are less effective at preventing infection from BA.4 and BA.5. Previous infection provides less immunity against BA.4 and BA.5. Mobility is increasing while mask wearing declines.\n\n, COVID is currently on the decline, but could change that. Our recommendations for the US: Individuals should get another COVID vaccine and a flu vaccine before the winter. States should secure antivirals, especially for those at high risk. Governments should continue screening for new variants.\n\nOn a global level, we see a rise in some European countries, including France, Germany, and the UK. The future is still unclear in China, but much of the population remains susceptible to severe infection.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 in the United States\n\nIn the United States, reported cases, infections, hospitalizations, and deaths continue to decline. This is the pattern we have seen in the northeastern states. It is spreading across the United States, and we project that this will continue all the way until the end of September, when we are expecting another wave.\n\nWe are concerned in the United States because of the fast spread of BA.4 and BA.5 \u2013 they are escape variants in that it seems from the new studies we are looking at, that the vaccines are less effective in preventing infection of BA.4 and BA.5. They are still very effective in preventing severe illness and mortality, but we are concerned that with BA.4 and BA.5 spreading fast with the relaxation of mandates and with the patterns we are seeing in some European countries where there is a third wave, we are concerned that there is potential here for another bump or increase in cases in the coming months.\n\nWe will update our models the second week of July, and we will include all this new information in our models. We will then predict if we see a third wave or not, and how big it will be and how long it will last. In general, we're heading in the right direction in the United States.\n\nOur recommendations for the US\n\nWe're expecting a surge in winter, and the focus right now in the United States should be on vaccinating people and getting the booster, and then getting another vaccination before the winter, especially also with flu. We expect that flu season could be bad because we haven't seen flu in the past three years. Our recommendation would be to take another COVID-19 vaccine before winter and a flu vaccine.\n\nAlso, our recommendation is for every state to secure enough antivirals in order to make sure they are provided to infected people, especially those who are at high risk, elderly, and people with immunocompromise or with risk factors, chronic conditions, to make sure that we reduce the burden on our hospitals and we save lives.\n\nAnd, of course, continue screening and making sure that we don't lose track of what's circulating in our country, and if there is an increase in cases due to another variant or pre-existing variant, we take the measures that are necessary to stop the spread of this virus.\n\nCases rising in Europe\n\nOn the global level, what we are seeing right now is a rise in some European countries. We see a third wave, driven mainly by BA.4 and BA.5, and the relaxation of mandates, increased mobility, and low mask wearing. We see the third wave with an increasing number of reported cases, and we see it in France, in Germany, beginning of it in the UK, in Greece, in Israel.\n\nThat's a big concern for us because what has happened before in Europe has happened here in the United States, and we could see here in the United States a third wave, especially from BA.4 and BA.5, which are increasing as a percentage of the variants that are circulating.\n\nWe know right now from several studies that previous infections from other variants do not provide as much immunity against Omicron and BA.4 and BA.5. Also, the vaccines are less effective in terms of preventing infection. They're still effective against severe illness and mortality for BA.4 and BA.5.\n\nSo putting these two together, we are very much concerned that we could see potentially in the United States another wave after the second wave due to BA.4, BA.5, relaxation of the mandates, increased mobility, and low mask wearing.\n\nWe will update our numbers in July, most likely the second week due to the holiday, and we will take into account all this new information about the spread of BA.4 and BA.5 in Europe, and the new studies that are showing less effect of the vaccine against BA.4 and BA.5.\n\nFuture unclear in China\n\nChina remains a big mystery for us \u2013 we don't know what's going to happen in China. They're successful so far in containing the virus, but this could change as soon as they change their policy and open up the country because they have had fewer infections because of their success before, their vaccine is not as effective, and much of their elderly population is not vaccinated. So we could see a rise of cases in China as well.\n\nJune 10, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nGlobal infections are increasing : Secondary Omicron waves are hitting parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Portugal, and the United States. We expect a peak in June, but another surge in the northern hemisphere in September, leading to an additional 120,000 deaths by October.\n\n: Secondary Omicron waves are hitting parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Portugal, and the United States.

Policy insights and recommendations: Mask mandates in parts of the US are unlikely to have a large effect. We must maintain global surveillance to prepare for the possibility of new variants. Ensure access to antivirals for vulnerable individuals.\n\n\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nGlobal infections are increasing\n\nIn this week's release from IHME of our COVID forecasts, there are some key observations of what's happening around the world and what we see coming in the models. Globally, we're starting to see the estimated number of infections go up again, and that's driven by secondary Omicron waves in a number of places in sub-Saharan Africa, in a wide array of locations in Latin America, from Quintana Roo, other states in Mexico, through to a number of states in Brazil and all the way in between.\n\nThere are also some small increases in states in India, and perhaps most concerning is a quite substantial secondary wave of Omicron in Portugal, related to the BA.5 variant with an associated meaningful increase in the death rate, which we have not generally seen with these secondary Omicron waves in Europe and the northeast of the US. The last place where there is some secondary increase from Omicron is some of the Southern states in the US and some of the states in the Midwest.\n\nOmicron peak is expected in June\n\nDespite these increases, we remain reasonably sure in the modeling that they will peak sometime in June, given what we've seen in Europe with the secondary waves, and what we've seen in the northeast of the US, as well as what we saw with the BA.4-5 wave in South Africa. So we expect these to be short-lived, and to not really alter the global trajectory over the next few months.\n\nAn outbreak in China could have a major global impact\n\nThe big question mark remains, at the global level, what happens in China. We are assuming that strict lockdown measures will continue through to October, and that they will be, as they have been to date, successful. The reporting of 11 cases today in Shanghai will raise the real questions about the economic toll in China from the strict lockdown policies, but so far there's no indication of a change from the leadership in China.\n\n120,000 deaths expected globally by October 1\n\nPutting all that together in our forecasts, we do not see large numbers of deaths. Although when you add it up around the world, still about 120,000 deaths are to be expected between now and October 1.\n\nThe other insight that comes from the modeling is that we expect to see numbers starting to go back up again in the Northern Hemisphere in early September or late September, likely leading into increases \u2013 modest increases \u2013 in the fall.\n\nMask mandates in the US unlikely to have a big impact\n\nThere is some concern in parts of the US seeing secondary Omicron waves, such as in California, where some mandates have been put back in place, namely mask mandates, for example in Alameda county. As far as we can tell from both the modeling, as well as from the experience elsewhere of the secondary waves, we don't necessarily think that will have a big effect, nor is it necessary given the low infection-fatality rate and given the availability of antivirals, particularly, which should mean that we won't see a substantial increase in death.\n\nSome of the debate about this is getting still obscured, this many months into Omicron, because we are not getting good data that differentiates incidental hospitalizations \u2013 people coming to hospital with COVID-19, but that's not the reason for their hospitalization \u2013 from hospitalizations and deaths where COVID is the true cause. And without that it's very easy for a highly contagious and reasonably prevalent infection like Omicron to appear like the numbers are increasing substantially.\n\nContinuing surveillance for new variants and access to antivirals will be key\n\nClearly all of this optimistic view over the next few months at the global level is predicated on the idea that there will not be a new variant that has immune escape and is more severe than Omicron. But of course, that is a distinct possibility and it highlights why maintaining global surveillance \u2013 so that if such a variant emerges, the world knows about it as soon as possible \u2013 is really crucial, as is preparing for access for the vulnerable for antivirals, because that's likely in the future to be the strategy that will make the biggest difference if a new variant comes along.\n\nJune 3, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nGlobal death toll declining: We are now seeing a daily death rate last seen in March 2020.\n\nWe are now seeing a daily death rate last seen in March 2020.

Policy recommendation: Monitor for new variants and be prepared to respond if a new, more dangerous one should emerge. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity Daily death toll declining globally This week at IHME in our update on COVID, we do not have a new model release. That will be coming next week, but we continue to monitor the pandemic. We are really reaching, at the global level, an extraordinarily low level of the impact of COVID. In fact, the death toll at the daily level has now reached the level we last saw around March 20, 2020. We continue to see this very favorable trend down. Low or declining cases in China, South Africa, Europe, and the US At the location level, the strict lockdown policy, zero-COVID strategy in China continues to work, although it has great economic effects. The reported cases, as far as we can tell in China, are now down to a very low level. We do expect in our modeling, and continue to expect, that it will be hard to sustain that, given the considerable number of susceptible individuals that are still in China. Elsewhere, where there were surges related to either BA.4 or BA.5 in South Africa, that's peaked and continues to decline. The BA.2 surges in Europe seem to have all peaked and are pretty much declining. Here in the US, as we expected, at the national level it appears that case reporting has peaked and is starting to come down, but of course that varies by location. The decline is more in the northeast. Other states are still on the upswing, but nationally we should start to see the numbers come down. We do continue to expect, in the absence of the emergence of a variant with considerable immune escape on Omicron, that we will see quite low numbers through the next few months. We must continue monitoring for new variants Of course, we've learned through the pandemic that the emergence of a new variant can completely change the story in a very quick manner. But for now, it does appear like those countries that are largely returning to pre-COVID levels of interaction and very low levels of mask use will continue to see low or even declining transmission, and certainly low or declining impacts in terms of death, given the slow but steady scale-up of the use of antivirals. So, there are very favorable conditions for the moment. We do believe it's important to keep up surveillance and to be ready on a country-by-country basis to respond with booster shots, with access to antivirals, and if a dangerous, high-severity new variant with immune escape emerged, to be able to reconsider other actions as well.

Of major areas of interest, in South Africa, the BA.4-5 related increase in cases has peaked and is coming down, which fits with the expectation that while there was some reduction in cross-variant immunity from BA.4-5 compared to previous waves of Omicron, it was not very large.\n\nOmicron under control in China\n\nLikewise, we're seeing that the measures put in place in China for strict lockdown, at least according to official data, continue to be successful, with case numbers coming down. Of course, the question will be whether or not there are going to be \u2013 as we expect, given the large volume of susceptible individuals \u2013 further Omicron outbreaks, and the need for other efforts at strict lockdown in China, still pursuing a zero-COVID strategy.\n\nCases expected to peak in the US within a few weeks\n\nIn the United States, the increase in cases, probably driven by behavioral relaxation, seems to be slowing. There is a spatial heterogeneity aspect to this, but for example, in our own hospital system at the University of Washington, our number of hospital admissions has peaked and is starting to come down, as an example of a place with one of these surges.\n\nSo, as we've been expecting for many weeks, we do not think these current increases in the US will lead to large-scale increases in death, certainly, or hospitalization. We should see a peak about the end of May or early June at the national level.\n\nCurrent recommendations\n\nPending the emergence of new variants that are more severe than Omicron, the current strategies of continuing to offer boosters to those who would like to get a booster, making sure that antivirals are available for those who are at risk who do get infected with Omicron, and continuing surveillance, are the most important aspects of monitoring the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMay 20, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nRegional updates: China continues zero-COVID strategy and reports no increase in cases. South Africa may be reaching a peak of the BA.4/BA.5 winter surge. The United States is experiencing an increase in Omicron cases \u2013 likely due to behavioral changes, and possibly due to re-infection with BA.2 \u2013 but not an increase in deaths.\n\nMandates: We do not expect mandates to be widely re-implemented, outside of zero-COVID policies in China.\n\nWe do not expect mandates to be widely re-implemented, outside of zero-COVID policies in China. Cross-variant immunity: New research suggests limited immunity against other variants after Omicron infection. However, immunity from vaccination and previous infection does provide strong protection from severe illness and death.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nChina reports no increase in cases\n\nWe do not have updated models this week, but we continue to monitor the unfolding of the pandemic around the world. Areas of ongoing interest are the approach to zero-COVID in China, which continues. Officially reported cases are actually not increasing, and they're maybe coming down, but stringent mandates are in place in many locations. From experience in other countries, we do expect at some point that Omicron will spread widely in China, but it is very much a question of when \u2013 and when the government decides to stop pursuing this zero-COVID strategy.\n\nCases increasing in South Africa and United States\n\nElsewhere in the world, we're seeing increases. The BA.4- and BA.5-related and winter-related increase in South Africa continues. It is certainly not as exponential as the original Omicron wave, but it does continue to increase. With some indication, it may be reaching a peak.\n\nIn the United States, Omicron continues to increase in a number of states. That increase, again, seems to be like what we've observed in many countries in Europe, related to behavioral relaxation and possibly BA.2 re-infection of people who have had a prior Omicron infection \u2013 although it's perhaps easiest to account for through behavioral change.\n\nMandates not expected to be reimplemented\n\nIn neither case, neither what we saw in Europe nor what we're so far seeing in the United States, are we seeing an increase in death, which is very good news. That's likely because there is either vaccine-derived or infection-acquired immunity, so that people aren't fully immunologically naive, and perhaps because of the increased use of antivirals when individuals do become sick, which should have a marked effect on the death rate. We don't, at this point, think that there's reason for large-scale concern and also do not expect, with few exceptions, that there will be implementation of mandates in these jurisdictions, outside the zero-COVID strategy in China.\n\nNew studies show limited immunity from Omicron infection\n\nOne of the critical factors that do go into the long-range modeling, and even the short-range, is the extent to which Omicron infection provides protection against subsequent new variants, or even sub-variants of Omicron. There was a paper in Nature this week, which is a lab-based paper, based on the immune responses from serum from different types of patients, which suggests that there may be a limited cross-variant protection from Omicron infection.\n\nRead more in Nature \u00bbLimited cross-variant immunity from SARS-CoV-2 Omicron without vaccination\n\nWe'll really want to wait and see when studies are able to start reporting, from actual infection in individuals, what sort of cross-variant immunity there is. Both from vaccine-derived immunity and infection-acquired immunity, the available studies suggest much lower protection against Omicron infection, pretty good protection against severe disease and death, but greatly reduced for infection. We'll have to wait and see whether that difference holds true for Omicron on Omicron by sub-variant, or even future variants, namely less protection against infection, but hopefully more protection against severe disease and death.\n\nThat issue will have a profound effect on what the fall and winter may look like, as we do expect waning immunity, both from vaccines and infection-acquired immunity, plus indoor exposure and opportunities for transmission, that there should be increased transmission potential in November, December, and January, and the extent to which there is long-range protection from severe disease and death will have a marked effect on outcomes.\n\nMay 16, 2022 - US reaches 1 million COVID deaths\n\nAs the United States reaches this somber milestone, IHME director Dr. Christopher Murray reflects on the impact of COVID-19 around the world and how we can better prepare for future health threats.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nThe US has officially surpassed the awful milestone of a million reported deaths from COVID. This is a number that I think very few of us thought would ever come to pass when the pandemic started to break in February of 2020. In fact, back then we thought a concerted response would mean that the number would be a tenth of that, or even less.\n\nNow, the true number of deaths from COVID is even larger. We think, based on looking at excess deaths, it's probably closer to 1.3 million deaths that have already occurred in the US, but by either metric, it's a staggering number.\n\nCOVID has had a terrible toll, not just here in the US but around the world, with 6 million reported deaths and more than 18 million excess deaths; those deaths are distributed throughout the regions of the world and not just in North America or in Europe.\n\nWe've entered a new phase of the pandemic, a phase where Omicron is much milder and a large fraction of the world's population has been infected with Omicron. The Omicron story has still to play out in China and North Korea, but in general we're entering this phase where people are going back to pre-COVID levels of interaction. Mask use is declining dramatically, and I think that's going to be the new normal.\n\nWe will see continued Omicron transmission, and Omicron will come back in the winter if we don't see a new variant. But it's likely we will see a new variant, and so while we might think that the era of mandates and profound changes in behavior might be behind us, we certainly haven't seen the end of COVID-19.\n\nWe should be thinking about how we manage COVID-19 new variants as they emerge and the critical role of continued use of boosters, vaccinating those who are still willing to be vaccinated but haven't been, and the new tools that we have like Paxlovid and potential other antivirals as they come along. All those combined mean, even if we have a new variant, we don't expect it to be as bad as it has been, which is good news. But it should give us pause to recognize the threat that we live with in the future, for either some remarkable new variant that will break through our current tools entirely, or new pathogens and new pandemics in the future.\n\nHopefully, this extraordinary experience in the US will motivate the US government and other governments to invest in greater capabilities to respond to new threats; detect them earlier; have a more rational, thoughtful, but rapid response to those threats as they emerge; and then to figure out who are most vulnerable, whether it's the groups that are essential workers, or those that have some sort of comorbidity, or those that are elderly. Whatever it may be for a new threat, it's critical that we learn about protecting the most vulnerable for future rounds of threats as they emerge.\n\nAt this terrible milestone, it is an opportunity for us to reflect both on what went wrong and how we can solve and prepare ourselves better for future rounds of COVID and future threats.\n\nMay 12, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nEast Asia: As rapid transmission of Omicron unfolds in Taiwan, it seems inevitable that an outbreak will also occur in China. However, it is impossible to predict when that may occur as it depends on how long the government chooses to continue pursuing a zero-COVID strategy.\n\nAs rapid transmission of Omicron unfolds in Taiwan, it seems inevitable that an outbreak will also occur in China. However, it is impossible to predict when that may occur as it depends on how long the government chooses to continue pursuing a zero-COVID strategy. United States: Cases are increasing, particularly in the Northeast and on the West Coast, due to returning pre-COVID behavior patterns. Short-term: We predict a small peak in May to early June, but no major surge until the winter. Long-term: We predict as many as 30% of the US population will get infected through the winter with Omicron due to declining immunity. However, we expect the consequences to be much, much lower because of antivirals.\n\nCases are increasing, particularly in the Northeast and on the West Coast, due to returning pre-COVID behavior patterns. Global: Data from South Africa do not indicate that BA.4 and BA.5 will lead to a major global surge. Our recommended strategy for dealing with COVID on a global scale is securing access to antivirals for all.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nOmicron and the zero-COVID strategy in East Asia\n\nLast week in IHME\u2019s updated forecasts, we certainly were trying to take into account what\u2019s unfolding in East Asia with continued rapid expansion of the Omicron epidemic in Taiwan, and that continues to expand. There\u2019s this very challenging question of how Omicron will play out in China. The government is pursuing their zero-COVID strategy with lockdowns as needed.\n\nWe have been expecting Omicron, since February, in our modeling to eventually break through these efforts because it has appeared that control efforts on Omicron have been generally less successful around the world than for previous variants. So far, these strict lockdown policies have kept Omicron numbers at a relatively low level.\n\nIt's extremely hard to understand how the policy environment will play out in China. If they pursue strict lockdowns, it's possible they will keep Omicron transmission at a relatively modest level through to the fall. We do believe that it is inevitable there will be a large Omicron outbreak at some point in China, because maintaining a strict zero-COVID strategy is probably unsustainable as the year progresses, but it's impossible to know when that change in policy will occur.\n\nIncreasing cases in the United States and predictions for the winter\n\nIn the US, we're seeing increases in a number of parts of the country, particularly the Northeast, and some of the West Coast, in cases and hospital admissions. This is a pattern that follows what we\u2019ve seen in Europe as people's behavior goes back to pre-COVID levels, and there is a little bit of transition to BA.2 and perhaps BA.4 and BA.5 as they continue to spread.\n\nWe do expect a modest increase in numbers. Our expectation is they will peak sometime in May or early June and then go back down. We don't expect a major surge from that. There have been reports from the White House of their efforts to model in the long term a large surge in infections.\n\nIn our long-range models, which we do not release publicly, we do expect in the winter a return Omicron surge. Of course if there's a new highly infectious variant that's more severe, that would trump this pattern we expect. We expect a surge in the winter because of declining immunity from exposure to Omicron, as well as declining immunity from vaccination and perhaps not as high a rate of repeat boosters as we've seen for the third dose, going into the future. The consequences of a winter surge in the US should be much smaller because of Paxlovid and increasing availability of antivirals and use of antivirals.\n\nWe certainly expect quite large numbers in the winter, not so much in the fall \u2013 perhaps as many as 30% of the US population getting infected through the winter with Omicron. But we expect the consequences to be much, much lower because of antivirals.\n\nWe don\u2019t expect much in the way of government mandates, given the much lower ICU admission rate and death rate that should occur with these new strategies, particularly antivirals.\n\nGlobal strategy should be ensuring access to antivirals for all\n\nAt the global level, there's been ongoing debate and concern about BA.4 and BA.5 in South Africa. There\u2019s not an exponential surge there; there's a very slow increase in numbers. We so far are not seeing any indication that BA.4 and BA.5 could be the driver of a major global surge in cases, but of course this warrants monitoring on a regular basis.\n\nOverall, in terms of general strategy globally, we've seemingly maxed out globally on the number of people who are unvaccinated that want to be vaccinated \u2013 as far as we can tell from the data, only about 3% of the world wants a vaccination that hasn\u2019t received one. A lot of that is concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, but still it's not a large percentage of the population.\n\nPerhaps the main strategy to deal with future variants is making sure that anyone who needs antivirals will get access to antivirals. There's a lot in that, both in terms of production of Paxlovid and health system infrastructure, and response patterns so that when somebody needs it, they can get it whether they're in a low-resource or high-resource setting. Those are our main observations on the epidemic as it continues to unfold.\n\nMay 9, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nGlobal: Mortality from COVID-19 is the lowest since April 2020. 3.1% of the population who wants a vaccine has still not received one, most in Africa. We must ensure equity in distribution of antiviral medication. Eid El-Fitr celebrations in Islamic countries could lead to a small increase in cases.\n\nMortality from COVID-19 is the lowest since April 2020. United States: Reported cases and hospitalizations are increasing. We predict an additional 29,000 deaths by September. Home testing and delayed reporting of infections has made it more difficult to track COVID-19. We recommend: continuing surveillance for new variants, securing antiviral medication, preparing to return to mask use and physical distancing if another variant arises.\n\nReported cases and hospitalizations are increasing. We predict an additional 29,000 deaths by September. China: The large percentage of elderly and unvaccinated people makes the population very susceptible to high mortality rates and overwhelmed hospitals if the zero-COVID policy fails. The current rise in Taiwan and previous surge in Hong Kong are warning signs of what could happen.\n\nThe large percentage of elderly and unvaccinated people makes the population very susceptible to high mortality rates and overwhelmed hospitals if the zero-COVID policy fails.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nProjections and recommendations for the United States\n\nWe have increased our projections to September 1. Right now in the United States we are projecting 1.02 million deaths by September 1. That's an additional 29,000 deaths from May 2, when we ran our programs.\n\nFor the United States, the recommendations remain the same:\n\nWe need to continue our surveillance and make sure we are doing enough sequencing to know what variants are circulating in the United States, and if BA.4 and BA.5 are being introduced in the US and how fast they are spreading. At the same time, we need to ensure that we have enough antiviral medications in order to distribute them. We know from their clinical trials that they reduce hospitalization and mortality, and they will reduce the pressures on our hospitals. Third, which is very important, if we are seeing a rise due to another variant in the United States, we should go back to wearing masks and physical distancing.\n\nIn the United States we are seeing an increase in reported cases and hospitalizations. In some states, we are seeing the rate of increase in admissions to hospital is much higher than the rate of increase of reported cases. We believe that's due to the fact that many people are testing themselves at home and not reporting to their counties and not using the local labs, so we are not capturing these cases.\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 under study in South Africa\n\nWe are monitoring closely what's happening in South Africa, the infections with BA.4 and BA.5. We don't know yet if they are immune escape and they are infecting people that have been previously infected by BA.2. It's too early to tell, and the fact that many people in South Africa have been infected by Omicron 4-5 months ago, it's possible that the waning immunity is resulting in the infection from BA.4 and BA.5.\n\nChinese population remains susceptible, relying on zero-COVID policy\n\nAt the global level, mortality from COVID-19 is the lowest since April 2020. The global trends are mainly dominated by what's happening in China. Right now we are seeing a rise in cases in Taiwan. China is continuing with its zero-COVID policy and we feel that they will be able to control COVID-19 for a while. However, the economic pressure may not allow them to continue with such a policy.\n\nIf what we are seeing happen right now in Taiwan, or what happened previously in Hong Kong, will happen in China, we project a lot of mortality, unfortunately, and the surge will overwhelm the hospitals. Many older Chinese people are not vaccinated at the same level as other countries, and also the vaccines used in China are less effective than the vaccines used elsewhere, mRNA vaccines. So we would expect a major surge and a rise in mortality in China.\n\nVaccine and antiviral equity: we are not safe until all of us are safe\n\nBased on vaccination rates and our monitoring of people who are willing to take the vaccine, we estimate right now that about 3.1% of people globally who want to get the vaccine and are willing to get the vaccine, have not received it. The majority of them are in Africa. We need to make sure that people who want to get the vaccine are receiving them, who failed distribution, which countries should support poor countries to get the vaccine and vaccinate their population. Again, we're not safe until all of us are safe.\n\nThe most important thing moving forward right now globally is to ensure that the global distribution, like with vaccination, that global distribution for antivirals is going forward and countries can secure what they need from antiviral in order to provide it to people who are infected, to reduce hospitalization and mortality.\n\nProjections in Islamic countries following Eid El-Fitr\n\nWe are not projecting a rise in cases in the Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean region, WHO region, but we are concerned in many Islamic countries after Eid El-Fitr celebrations with all the mobility, and people are visiting each other and celebrating the holidays. It's possible in some of these countries the decline will slow down and it's possible in some countries that we'll see a small surge in the coming weeks due to the holidays and the celebration.\n\nChallenges with data collection\n\nAt IHME, with our projections, our major challenge in the coming months is the delay in reporting. Many countries and many states have moved to weekly reporting and it's very hard for us to monitor the situation. The fact in the United States that many people are testing themselves at home and not reporting their infections to the local health departments is making it hard for us to follow the epi-curve.\n\nWe are using admissions to hospitals, COVID-19 admissions, as our main indicator and some places like the United States, where we believe many people are testing themselves at home and not reporting those results to their local health department, we have lowered the infection-detection rate in order to make sure we'll be able to monitor these trends.\n\nApril 29, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nOmicron will continue to spread in China. After already reaching Beijing, Omicron will likely continue transmission despite the government\u2019s indication that they will keep pursuing the zero-COVID strategy.\n\nAfter already reaching Beijing, Omicron will likely continue transmission despite the government\u2019s indication that they will keep pursuing the zero-COVID strategy. Cases are increasing in Delhi, India, and South Africa. The question remains: are the increases due to new, more transmissible sub-variants, or waning immunity from the previous Omicron wave?\n\nThe question remains: are the increases due to new, more transmissible sub-variants, or waning immunity from the previous Omicron wave? A concerted policy push is needed to increase access to antivirals. IP waivers have been given to 22 countries by Pfizer, and now a rapid scale-up in production must follow.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nOmicron spreading in China\n\nThis week from IHME we are not releasing a new set of projections yet. With few exceptions, the epidemic is still continuing to track our forecasts from earlier in the month. The key areas to pay attention to right now are, first and foremost, what's happening in China with the Omicron wave spreading, most importantly to Beijing. Many other cities within China apparently are also under lockdowns or partial lockdowns.\n\nAs we have been noting for months pre-Olympics, it's really a question of time when Omicron will spread more widely in China, given how transmissible it is, given the comparatively lower efficacy of the vaccines used in China, and particularly this issue that the zero-COVID strategy may not actually work. But our understanding is that the government will pursue that strategy vigorously, at least until the fall. So, no real change in expectations there, but it simply will be a challenging question as to whether that strategy can hold out until the fall.\n\nIncreasing cases in India\n\nThe second area of concern that people have been tracking has been the steady uptick in cases in Delhi, India. The question is whether this is due to declining immunity from the prior Omicron wave or the possibility of one of the sub-variants of Omicron fueling transmission in Delhi. They have re-imposed their mask mandate, so we\u2019ll see if that has some effect on that one part of India and the surrounding state of Haryana having some increased transmission.\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 variants in South Africa\n\nThe third area of concern is the uptick in South Africa associated with the BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants, a steady increase but not exponential. The question remains \u2013 is that because these sub-variants are more transmissible, or is it because they have immune escape over BA.1 and BA.2, which were there in South Africa and had become the predominant variants, or is it because of waning immunity, just through time. We are now, for South Africa, pretty much four months, or even four and a half in some provinces, after the peak of the Omicron wave.\n\nAccess to antivirals\n\nThe other main consideration globally around managing COVID, particularly in China and for the world, when new variants that are potentially more severe emerge, is access to Paxlovid. We\u2019ve started to finally see some policy discussion around the importance of availability and access to Paxlovid. IP waivers have been given to 22 countries by Pfizer, and the question is, will there be more rapid scale-up in production? We strongly believe that needs a concerted policy push, equivalent to the efforts to expand vaccination. We will certainly expect more from IHME as we run our models in the near future to reflect any new updates in the data as we\u2019ve been describing.\n\nDo you have a question about IHME's COVID-19 modeling? We\u2019d love to know what you\u2019re wondering about.\n\nAsk a question\n\n\n\nDue to the sheer volume of questions we receive and our research team\u2019s dedicated efforts in modeling the impact of Omicron around the world, we will only be able to address a limited number of questions. For media inquiries, please contact [email protected].\n\nApril 25, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nNew modeling suggests antivirals will be key to save lives during future surges. We are investigating the potential impact if a future variant were to be as severe as Delta with the transmission level of Omicron, and have found that antivirals make a profound difference.\n\nWe are investigating the potential impact if a future variant were to be as severe as Delta with the transmission level of Omicron, and have found that antivirals make a profound difference. Cases are rising in the eastern United States , but deaths are not. Access to antivirals plays a key role in the low death rate.\n\n, Access to antivirals plays a key role in the low death rate. Still unknown if lockdowns will prevent an Omicron surge in China. Low vaccination among the 80+ population could result in a huge death toll if an outbreak occurs.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nLockdowns and Omicron in China This week from IHME, we have not rerun our models. We have been spending time trying to understand the epidemic province by province in China. The key thing there as the outbreak continues to unfold in Shanghai with very broad-based transmission, is now reports of lockdown are confirmed by mobility data in many other cities within China. It remains to be seen whether the zero-COVID strategy will work to keep COVID, or the Omicron variant, from spreading very widely in China. What we do know is that vaccine coverage in the 80+ population in many provinces is quite low. If Omicron spreads widely, there is a real risk that what we saw in Hong Kong could re-occur in mainland China. That's something that we are watching very closely. Currently, our models are assuming that the success that China's had with the zero-COVID strategy controlling Omicron in February, around the time of the Olympics, could be replicated, but we're also hearing reports that the economic costs of this are rising. Cases on the rise in eastern United States For the United States, we're seeing rising case numbers in a number of eastern states. There's some suggestion of rising case numbers in other states as well. There has not been a precipitous rise in case numbers yet \u2013 this increase looks to be related to continued relaxation of behavior, combined with the BA.2 sub-variant. The good news there is we're not seeing an increase in deaths. But it does point out how critical in the US \u2013 and pretty much everywhere \u2013 access to antivirals is going to be. New modeling suggests antivirals will be key to save lives during future surges While there continues to be a lot of discussion about access to vaccines in low- and middle-income countries and even discussion around boosters, there's perhaps not enough focus on making sure that people who need these highly effective antivirals like Paxlovid [can get them] in the future. This is somewhat important right now for the BA.2 sub-variant, but could be extremely important in the future as we imagine that there will be more infectious and potentially more severe variants that emerge during the course of this year. We have started to do some modeling of what would happen if a variant that was as severe as Delta came along with the transmission potential of Omicron, and in that setting, widespread access to an antiviral like Paxlovid really makes a profound difference in saving lives around the world. So a very high priority, both in the US and everywhere in the world, for thinking about health system delivery strategies and access to the drug itself, is that those who can benefit from an antiviral are going to get that antiviral. Expect more from us in the coming weeks as we continue to track the pandemic and try to model out how future scenarios unfold, both with what we know is currently occurring, but also potentially the emergence of new variants. Emergence of new sub-variants The last comment is on the emergence of the BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants in South Africa. They are replacing BA.2 and there is some increase in case numbers, but still modest so far, as distinct from what happened with BA.2. We're now four months or more into the peak of Omicron transmission, so some of that increase in BA.4 and BA.5 could be from waning immunity from what was established through the early Omicron wave in November and December in South Africa. But it\u2019s clearly another facet of the epidemic that will bear close monitoring. April 14, 2022 - Update from Dr. Ali Mokdad\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nBA.2 surge is ending in Europe.

For those who are immunocompromised or have high risk factors: continue wearing a mask and avoiding large crowds, especially indoors.\n\n\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nCases are declining in Europe Globally, we are seeing a decline in reported cases in the majority of countries, and the short surge that has happened after the Omicron surge in some European countries is declining. So we see a decline in reported cases right now in the UK, in Germany, in France. In the long run, we believe that the number of cases will keep declining all the way to next winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Surge predicted in China if precautions fail: only 30% of population currently immune The situation we are monitoring closely right now is what\u2019s happening in China. We believe the strict measures and the lockdown in China have been successful so far in containing the spread of the virus, but with Omicron being extremely contagious and spreading much faster than any previous variant we have encountered, we don\u2019t believe that China could contain the spread of Omicron for a long time. So we\u2019re expecting a rise of infections, reported cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in China if these measures that are in place right now are not successful in containing the spread of the virus. The reason we believe that for China \u2013 if you look at measures that China put in place, they were so effective at preventing infection. Right now in China, about 2% of the public has been infected by COVID-19 since the beginning of COVID-19, compared to 76% of us here in the United States. So we have more immunity than people in China, we have better vaccines with mRNA, and we have a higher vaccination rate, especially among the elderly population. Not for the general population, but for the elderly population in the United States we have a higher vaccination coverage. So when you put all of these together, in the United States we have about 73% of the public that is immune to Omicron, compared to 32% in China. So any outbreak in China, simply because there are about 70% of the public in China that are susceptible to Omicron, we expect a rapid surge of cases, similar to what we are seeing in Hong Kong and in other countries as well. Mobility is increasing, while mask wearing and testing decline More countries are relaxing their mandates right now \u2013 for example, New Zealand and Australia opened their borders to each other and travel is allowed right now. This could have an impact on reported cases as people are traveling and feel they are free to travel right now. Mask wearing is the lowest since we started reporting on mask wearing and since IHME started promoting mask wearing and providing scenarios showing how effective masks are in preventing mortality. So we're at less than 25% right now when it comes to mask wearing \u2013 it varies by countries, but mask wearing has dropped a lot because many countries relaxed their mask mandates, especially in Europe. Testing is declining in many countries: for example, in the UK, they're not paying anymore for testing, so we're seeing a decline in testing. That will impact our ability to track the pandemic in many countries and many locations. Some countries and states have decided to release data on a weekly basis, not on a daily basis, so the quality of data, the timeliness of data has changed, and that will impact our ability to track \u2013 not only us, but other groups who are doing similar projections \u2013 our ability to track the pandemic moving forward. Sharing antivirals and vaccines with countries in need is imperative Globally, there is a need to secure more antiviral medication and make sure it is available to every country to save lives and to prevent overwhelming the hospitals and protect the medical system. In countries where we see a surge of cases, recommending people to wear a mask and observe physical distance will be important. And in many countries in the world, it's very important to encourage the public to receive the vaccines, especially those who are not yet vaccinated and those who are immunocompromised and have health conditions. Our data right now show that a small percentage of people globally who want to get a vaccine or are willing to take the vaccine have not been able to receive the vaccine. The majority are in Africa. Therefore, it's very important to share vaccines with countries where people are willing to take the vaccine and they're waiting to get their vaccine. This is the only way for all of us to save lives and stop the spread of the virus, and of course we're not safe until all of us are safe. In the United States, the BA.2 variant is causing small rise in cases, but no surge expected In the US, we are seeing a slight rise in reported cases in some states, but we don't expect a surge similar to what we have seen in some European countries here in the US, simply because in the United States we have more immunity due to higher rates of previous infections in the country. BA.2 right now is the main circulating variant here in the United States \u2013 about 86% of the variants that are circulating in the US are BA.2. But because of previous infections in the US and our immunity, we don't expect a surge similar to what we have seen in Europe. The extension of the mask mandate on public transportation at the federal level and on airplanes will help a lot, especially right now with spring break vacations and people traveling. Many families are traveling for the first time with their children right now since the start of the pandemic, so one would expect, with the increased mobility and the fact that mask wearing is less than 25% in the US, that we'll see a slight increase in reported cases in the United States. We still believe that the pandemic phase of COVID-19 is over, simply because we have higher infections here in the United States and hence higher immunity. We are improving our vaccine and we soon should be able to have vaccines that are designed for the new variants; the vaccines that we have right now are highly effective, but we need to remember they were designed for the [ancestral] variant. And of course we have antiviral medications that will save lives and prevent hospitalization. If there is a surge from an escape variant, we can always go back to physical distancing and mask mandates and ask the public to wear a high-quality mask and avoid large gatherings. Recommendations for controlling the virus in the US The recommendations in the United States to contain the virus and the epidemic of this virus in the country remain the same: secure antiviral medications, distribute them, make sure patients can access them in a short time to save lives and prevent overwhelming our hospitals; maintain our surveillance system and also our genetic sequencing to know what variants are circulating in the US and, if there is a rise in cases, where it's happening and among whom, especially if they are vaccinated or not, so we can tell as soon as possible if the new variant is an escape variant and the vaccines are not as effective against it. For the public who are immunocompromised or have high risk factors, they need to remain more vigilant and wear a mask, especially if they are in close indoor settings with a large crowd. And all of us, if there is a surge and a new variant that is circulating, we also need to put our masks back on and make sure we maintain a physical and safe distance in order to reduce the chance of getting this virus. In the short term, the coming few months in the United States, IHME is projecting a decline after this tiny little surge, a decline of cases all the way until next winter, short of a new variant appearing. But we are projecting a decline in the number of cases all the way until next winter. April 8, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nNew prediction for China: no major Omicron surge.

Other countries around the world may also avoid a surge due to previous high levels of infection from Omicron. Access to antivirals should be the primary focus of global efforts, shifting from previous emphasis on vaccination.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nBA.2 is on the decline in Europe In this week's update from IHME on the COVID-19 pandemic, first, the main findings that we see in the data and in our forecasts are that the BA.2 secondary surge of Omicron that has affected a number of countries in Europe appears to have peaked and is on the decline in almost all locations in Europe. Not all \u2013 there is some question about whether the United Kingdom has peaked and that the decline in cases may be due to access to testing since the tests now have to be paid for. But generally, we are seeing the peak and probably the decline of BA.2 in Europe. We do not expect a major BA.2 surge in the US In the United States, we have yet to see a BA.2 surge. There are some states where we're seeing hospitalization admissions go up slightly but not seeing the reported cases go up. So it may be that there's a small increase coming in some states. Our models for both Europe and the US do not suggest \u2013 at least for the US, we don't expect a major BA.2 surge, and in Europe we expect the surges to peak and decline. New prediction for China: no major Omicron surge The biggest factor in the analysis is the change in our results for China. We had been predicting for quite some time that Omicron would break out into the community and that China would choose to stop using a zero-Covid strategy, or what they call dynamic lockdown. But, given the rather stringent measures put in place in Shanghai, we don't expect, at least until the fall, that the Chinese government is going to step back from its zero-Covid strategy. We've used in the forecasts the observed reduction in mobility based on Baidu data for Shanghai and then assumed that whenever there is an outbreak in each province in China that there will be stringent measures put in place. So we've put substantial brakes on transmission that way through reduction in mobility in our modeling framework. This means that we don't predict a massive surge. We expect that will come later in the year. But we do see quite a number of deaths, given the quite low vaccination rates in the 80+ population in China that have become apparent. We must shift global focus from vaccination access to antivirals The expected trajectory in China does point to a very important role in the current Omicron wave, but more importantly for future new variants as they emerge, in access to antivirals. We see a lot of global discourse about access to vaccination, and that's certainly an important issue in terms of equity \u2013 everybody who wants a vaccine should be able to obtain a vaccine. But in terms of preventing death from future new variants, we think that the scale-up of antivirals, particularly the highly effective Paxlovid \u2013 but if other antivirals come along that are as effective, then those as well \u2013 is going to be the critical issue between a new variant, let's say that's more severe than Omicron, causing considerable mortality versus causing 80-90% less mortality. We will be producing, in the near future, antiviral scale-up scenarios to go alongside vaccination, booster, and mask use scenarios that we routinely produce as part of our periodic assessment of the pandemic. Those are the main findings. Likelihood of BA.2 surge depends on countries\u2019 levels of previous infection In other parts of the world, we're not seeing any evidence of a BA.2 secondary surge, even in places like South Africa where most of the transmission is currently BA.2. This difference across countries may well have to do with population-level immunity, how much prior infection, how much the first Omicron wave infected people. In places where there was a lot of transmission, there's probably enough immunity that we won't see much of a BA.2-related hump. Those are the main observations as we look around the world in our assessment of the pandemic. Do you have a question about IHME's COVID-19 modeling?

Our long-term projections for the United States show a rise in cases next winter but a small bump in some states, similar to what we are seeing right now in Europe. But in general in the US, we project a decline that will continue all the way until next winter. What we need to do in the United States is to remain vigilant, of course. COVID-19 is not over; the pandemic phase of it is over. We need to be very careful, especially those who have a risk factor or are immunocompromised. Fourth vaccine dose recommended for those aged 50+ The FDA has approved a fourth dose for people who are above 50. It\u2019s very important for all of us who are above 50, including myself, to go and get number four. It will help a lot in reducing hospitalizations and mortality, especially if you have received your second dose or your third dose more than five months ago. Why is Europe seeing a second wave, and will the same happen in the US? As far as what\u2019s happening in Europe, we know that the second wave in Europe after the peak of Omicron was due to BA.2 spreading, change of behavior, and waning immunity. In the United States, because we have higher infection compared to Europe \u2013 for example, compared to the UK \u2013 we have lower vaccination but more infections. With the combination of the two, we have more immunity in the United States, especially in the Southern states, where they had more infections than we\u2019ve seen in the UK. So we will not expect a big bump in the US. There may be a very minor one in some states, but a decline overall. What the US needs to do is to secure more antiviral medication and keep it and distribute it right now to places ahead of the next surge. And make sure we have a plan for distribution based on risk factors and the aging of the population in each location, but also to have a plan for redistribution in case we have a wave in one state and medication sitting in a warehouse in another state. So, shifting resources is very important for preparedness. We believe that before winter, because of waning immunity, another shot may be needed as well, depending on whether people have received four or three doses. Still, in the US, vaccination is not increasing, and unfortunately we have leveled at about 65% at the national level. Risk of cruises and other activities varies by personal factors CDC has announced that it's ok to get on a cruise ship. I believe it's safe, in my opinion, if you are vaccinated and boosted, and now if you are above 50 and getting the fourth dose. But of course, for all of us, whatever we do from now on has to be based on our own personal risk and the risk of people we live with or we are around. So basically, for somebody who\u2019s young and healthy, the risk is very minimal to get Omicron or BA.2, but for somebody who's older in age, has a risk factor, or is immunocompromised, the risk is much higher. Of course, we have to behave accordingly to protect ourselves and the people we live with and we care about. That's very important. The BA.2 wave is coming to an end in Europe As far as the global landscape, what we are seeing right now in Europe and many countries, the second peak has happened, and it's starting to come down \u2013 in the UK, for example. It\u2019s still going up in France as of today, coming down in the Netherlands, so in many European countries, that second peak lasted about 3-4 weeks and came down. This was driven mainly by BA.2 and the change of behavior. In Europe, they had more mandates than we did here in the United States, and then there was a sudden change of behavior, more so than in some states here in the United States where we didn't have any mandates, Florida for example. So basically, the behavioral change that has happened after the peak of Omicron is minimal in the United States compared to what we've seen in Europe. China continues to keep Omicron at bay China is the country that we are keeping an eye on right now. China so far has been able to contain the spread of Omicron in Beijing by lockdown and massive testing. Whether they will be able to do so and maintain that control in Shanghai and other large cities is a big question mark. BA.2 and Omicron are more infectious, so we believe the chances of containing the spread of Omicron in China will be very limited. Our long-term projections in China show that they will have a major surge coming up with a peak in May, towards the end of May, with a large number of hospitalizations and mortality, for several reasons. China has a high vaccination rate, but their vaccine is not as effective as the vaccines we are using here in the United States or in European countries. So what China needs to do is \u2013 and we know they have right now received the permit to produce mRNA vaccines from Pfizer, and they have their own mRNA vaccine being developed right now \u2013 so producing more vaccines and vaccinating people, especially the elderly in China, because we know there are reports that vaccination among the elderly is very low compared to what we have seen in other countries. Second, is to produce more antivirals, and we know that they have right now licenses to produce antiviral medication and distribute it in China. Preparing their hospitals for the surge is very important right now. Vaccine donations are still appreciated, but only if they have a long shelf life Vaccine donations have saved a lot of lives all over the world, and countries have been generous in providing extra doses of vaccines to others who need it. It's very important to remember as you donate these vaccines to make sure they have a long shelf life. They shouldn't be about to expire. Once you give a vaccine to a country, there are a lot of logistics and distributions and manpower that's needed to administer these vaccines. Indonesia, for example, has asked all donors, please when you give us a vaccine let's make sure it has a long shelf life. We need to keep that in mind and not waste vaccines. Thank you everybody for donating the vaccine, but let's make sure the vaccine can be used by the country that is receiving them in time before they expire.\n\nMarch 21, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nFour zones of Covid transmission in the world Majority of countries: transmission continues to decline Western Europe: secondary increase in transmission from BA.2 Southeast Asia: peak Omicron wave China: not yet experienced an Omicron wave, but we anticipate it will arrive in the next few months, causing up to a million deaths\n\nBA.2: Countries that have already dealt with BA.2 transmission (Netherlands, Denmark) saw brief surges that ended reasonably quickly. That pattern may spread to the rest of Western Europe and North America. Increased transmission is likely due to a combination of BA.2 and reduced mask use and social distancing.\n\nUkraine: there will likely be increased transmission due to the ongoing war and crowded conditions, but the impact may be reduced because of high levels of prior immunity in the population.\n\nPolicy recommendation: We should shift focus away from vaccination and towards production and distribution of anti-virals like Paxlovid. Can reduce death rate by 90% More likely to maintain effectiveness against new variants that may come in the future\n\n\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nIn this week\u2019s update from IHME on the COVID-19 pandemic, the first thing to recognize is that there are really four zones of Covid transmission right now in the world. In the vast majority of countries, transmission continues to decline, as countries come off the peaks of Omicron transmission. Western Europe is experiencing a second wave in transmission from BA.2 As there has been quite a bit of media attention, there is a secondary increase in transmission in some countries in Western Europe, most notably the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, and Greece, are places where transmission is on the increase. That increase is being attributed to the substitution of the BA.2 variant for the BA.1 variant, combined with reduced mask use and social distancing. We don't think it's just BA.2, because BA.2 has actually been around for quite some time. In fact, for example in South Africa, it appeared in December. It's replaced BA.1 but there's been no substantial increase in community level transmission. We don't think \u2013 and you see this in our forecasts \u2013 that this combination of BA.2 and reduced caution about transmission will lead to a prolonged secondary surge. The reason is the surge in the Netherlands \u2013 it went up, then came back up, and now the secondary surge has already peaked and is on its way down. In Denmark, the BA.1 and BA.2 parts sort of coalesced into one and that also came to an end reasonably quickly. We think that will be the pattern that we'll see in other countries in Western Europe, and it's possible that pattern will spread to the United States and Canada as well. Southeast Asia is in peak Omicron wave The third zone are those countries still in the main upswing, or peak levels of transmission due to a delayed Omicron wave. Those are mostly in Southeast Asia \u2013 Vietnam and Cambodia are good examples of that. And then the biggest driver of transmission, cases, and potentially deaths, is what's playing out in the zero-Covid strategy countries, so New Zealand looks to have hit their peak on Omicron, but it's coming down quite slowly. China has not yet seen an Omicron wave And then the big, big question is China. Because we've seen in an immunologically naive population with not good vaccination coverage in the elderly, quite a toll in Hong Kong. And now the question is when and if that will spread to mainland China. There are outbreaks in multiple cities, including Shanghai and Shenzhen and a number of other locations. The Chinese government is still pursuing the strategy of lockdown for a short period and then multiple rounds of mass testing to identify all cases and then quarantine them. This worked in Beijing in February to stop transmission and they are trying to pursue this for now, but the economic consequences are very great and there's greater calls within the Chinese leadership for less of a stringent policy. We predict next wave in China could be devastating Our model foresees that that can't go on for that long and so we have a huge peak, with perhaps as many as a million deaths in China coming through in April, May, and into June. The timing of that will depend critically on how the Chinese government chooses to either relax or not their zero-Covid strategy. The other key issue that could mitigate the huge death toll that could be coming in China is the recent announcement of an IP waiver from Pfizer for Paxlovid for producers in 22 countries, including five producers in China. So there's an interesting strategic choice that will play out, which is that the balance of the economic harm of the aggressive zero-Covid strategy and creating time to produce anti-virals that would be sufficient to protect some of the unvaccinated elderly within China. The timing and how that plays out is going to be up to the policy choices in China. The importance of anti-virals If we step back and zoom out more globally, there's still a tremendous amount of energy in trying to address vaccine inequality and addressing supply constraints, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa around vaccination. That's certainly well-justified on moral grounds \u2013 everybody should have access to vaccination who wants it \u2013 but may not have a huge effect on death and hospitalization. We see in the data in sub-Saharan Africa and other low-income countries, that cumulative infection rates are quite high \u2013 80-90% of most countries have already been infected, they have immunity from infection, and also vaccine hesitancy is quite high. So even if the supply constraints are addressed \u2013 which they should be, on moral grounds \u2013 we should not expect that to make a huge effect on this 6-month timeframe of hospitalizations and death rates. However, what we don't see is similar international energy on the crucial issue of access to anti-virals, because anti-virals like Paxlovid can reduce the death rate by 90% and production capacity is small. With the new IP waivers going to India and China and some other countries, perhaps we can have a more concerted global effort in giving access to everybody who needs it, particularly the elderly, to anti-virals. That could really change the course of Covid over the next 12 months. The other aspect of the anti-virals scale-up that is important to recognize is that we don't really know if current vaccines will do much for future variants. Vaccine effectiveness against Omicron, particularly transmission, has been quite low with current vaccines. Whereas we suspect that the pathway that the anti-virals use will stay preserved and so the anti-virals will be an effective strategy irrespective of the type of variants that may come. So, as we step out and go into this phase where it's very unlikely that we'll see mandates and social distancing mandates as a main strategy for control. Then it's really down to vaccination and anti-virals. We've had lots of push on vaccination, and now we need equal policy attention and drive on the anti-virals. Covid in Ukraine Lastly, of course there is a real interest and attention on what might be the consequences on Covid of the war in Ukraine. Very difficult to assess, because of course the information systems have fallen apart amid the setting of the incredible destruction and invasion that is underway. But, one aspect of it that may mean the effect of millions of refugees crowding, lack of opportunities to social distance, may not be as bad as it might have been, is that despite low vaccination rates in the Ukraine, they have very high levels of prior infection, so there is quite a substantial amount of immunity. Of course, there will be increased transmission. We probably won't get any data about it, but hopefully the impact will be much less than if they had been a truly immunologically naive population.\n\nMarch 4, 2022 - COVID-19 impact on women's equality\n\nPresented by Dr. Emmanuela Gakidou\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nThe pandemic has disproportionately affected women in terms of employment & income loss, gender-based violence, and returning to school.\n\nPolicy action : Governments should incentivize girls going back to school and prioritize the areas of life most affected in their region.\n\nRead the research article.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nIt's really important, as we move past the latest wave of Omicron deaths and infections, to pay a lot of attention to the other areas of life and society that the pandemic has had a big pull on. In our study, we measured the impacts of the pandemic on some of these areas, particularly on employment and education, on income loss, on foregoing utilizing other health care for one\u2019s needs, and particularly how those may have disproportionately affected women compared to men around the world.\n\nAs the world moves on to the next phase, it is really important to consider all other aspects of life that the pandemic has had a big impact on, not only the direct effects on deaths and infections that we have been living with over the past two years.\n\nThe pandemic has disproportionately affected women when it comes to employment loss, to income loss, to increased perceptions of gender-based violence, and also with regard to education and who is returning to school compared to who is dropping out of school.\n\nRead \u00bbCOVID-19 Led to Worse Social and Economic Consequences for Women published in Think Global Health\n\nEven though there are a lot of areas that the pandemic has affected, our findings only scratch the surface of what the real impact of the pandemic may have been, as we have only been able to explore a few of these areas. But we think that the impact of the pandemic has been broad and is going to be felt for years to come.\n\nIt has been widely discussed that the effect of the pandemic on schools and on education is very profound. Sadly, we have very little data to measure what is happening right now to the millions of learners around the world, but from what we know, we are quite concerned that as societies and schools go back to normal, girls will be returning to education at a lower rate compared to boys. This happened after previous crises, and there are some indications that it is happening again as a result of COVID school closures. It is really important that societies and governments prioritize incentivizing girls going back to school and returning to education now that schools are reopening again.\n\nOur study is the first study that has taken a comprehensive lens to the impact of the pandemic on gender disparities. While we have not answered all the questions, we\u2019re hoping that policymakers will look at the most important areas of society and life that have been affected by COVID with respect to gender disparities in their own country, and prioritize what they should be addressing first. In some regions of the world, the most severe impact has been felt on employment loss; in other regions of the world, education should be prioritized. We\u2019re hoping that our study will contribute information needed as we move to the next phase of life and COVID-19, to prioritize the areas where the gender gaps are most pronounced and most severe.\n\nFebruary 17, 2022\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nCOVID anomalies: Cases on the rise: Russian Federation and Belarus Cases declining faster than expected: the Caribbean and South America Cases increasing again after a decline: Finland, Sardinia, Canada (Manitoba province)\n\nChina: Omicron wave has not yet hit, but we expect that will change by March or April.\n\nFunctional immunity: We\u2019re updating the model to reflect patterns in immunity from vaccination, previous infection from Omicron, or previous infection from other variants.\n\nUnited States: About \u00be of the population is currently immune to Omicron.\n\nWhat does the future hold? We expect there to be intensified transmission next winter and more variants will likely emerge.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nWhere cases have continued to rise This week\u2019s update from IHME on modeling and analyzing the COVID epidemic: First, in terms of what\u2019s happened around the world that is not following the trajectory that we expected, the only major observation on that front is that the increase in cases in the Russian Federation and perhaps Belarus has continued to rise. We expected because we\u2019ve estimated past infection levels to be very high, they should have run out of people to infect, but they\u2019ve kept going. So we expect that peak should come soon, but of course the fact that it has kept going may imply that levels of past infection have not been as high as we\u2019ve previously expected. Where cases are declining faster than expected The second observation is that the Omicron wave is going down faster in some regions than we expected, or somewhat faster. The Caribbean stands out \u2013 actually South America in general stands out \u2013 in declining faster than perhaps we expected. Where cases are increasing again after a decline There are a handful of anomalies that we are observing around countries where after a decline, cases have gone back up. Finland is included in that, Sardinia would be in that group, Manitoba province in Canada. In each of these, we\u2019re not sure what the explanation is \u2013 could be a local phenomenon around increased transmission or spatial spread. In the case of Finland, it may be the same thing that happened in Denmark \u2013 the spread of the BA.2 variant. But certainly, these are not happening in a large number of locations and seem to be specific to those particular places. The situation in China Our global numbers do look different because of China, where we expected that by now the Omicron epidemic would have taken hold more broadly in the community and we would be seeing widespread transmission. The public health authorities in China, through vigorous lockdowns, have been able to stop transmission in Beijing. We are therefore pushing out later into March and April what we continue to expect will happen \u2013 which is that there will be a widespread Omicron wave. At the global level, that makes a difference. How we\u2019re factoring in functional immunity The last thing to note is that as part of our analyses, we are going to be including what\u2019s in the models for quite some time: the fraction of people in each population that have got functional immunity to Omicron. That immunity comes from vaccination, even though vaccines are only partially effective for blocking Omicron infection; it comes from past infection with other variants; and it comes from infection with Omicron. In each case, we compute that functional immunity, taking into account the pattern of waning for vaccination and for natural infection, and the cross-variant immunity, or the breakthrough that Omicron has against prior variant infection. When you put all that together, in a place like for example the United States, we see about three-fourths of the population currently are immune to Omicron. We expect that number will continue to grow as we go through this tail-end of the Omicron wave in the United States. Does that mean that so many people are immune to Omicron that we will see no further transmission or waves of COVID in the future? The answer is no, because we will have \u2013 if no new variant emerges \u2013 we would expect Omicron to return next winter. There will be more waning of immunity, more people will have gone back to being susceptible, and we\u2019d be back into winter intensified transmission. Of course, we do think variants will emerge, and so further increases or outbreaks are likely as the new variants emerge that have immune escape and can infect people who are currently immune to Omicron. We don\u2019t expect those new variants, however, to have the same consequence that the Delta variant had last year. Because global levels of immunity are going to be much higher and there\u2019s the advent of access, which we hope will eventually be global, to antivirals, which will substantially reduce the infection-fatality rate. Those are the main insights from this week\u2019s analysis.

It will be difficult for zero-COVID countries, like China, to keep Omicron at bay. The new variant is so transmissible that even lockdowns will not hold it off for long.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for clarity\n\nHow will your model account for incidental COVID deaths? We know from a variety of community-level studies \u2013 hospital pre-admission screenings, some cohort studies in India, the ONS [UK Office for National Statistics] infection survey \u2013 that Omicron comes with a very high prevalence in the community, as high as 10% or 12% of the population shedding virus at any one time. And that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the incidental hospital admissions and deaths. The challenge as we dig into this is jurisdiction. By jurisdiction, the way incidental admissions and deaths are being counted appears to be different. And so, at present, we're not able to understand this difference for every jurisdiction. We are starting to compile the data as provided, or the guidance as provided, by each jurisdiction, but since we track nearly 400 different jurisdictions, counting the subnational units in many countries, it's going to be quite a task for us to fully understand this. But it's a work in progress. How has IHME\u2019s approach to COVID-19 forecasting changed? The IHME approach to modeling the epidemic has kept progressing as the epidemic unfolded. Our very first model in March of 2020 was really driven by the experience observed in Wuhan and the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions there on transmission. We then transitioned to a transmission dynamics model with other drivers, mask use, mobility, testing, and a bunch of contextual factors such as smoking, air pollution, and altitude, population density, and a variety of other factors. And then we had to modify the model to take into account vaccination, and then the spread of variants with the emergence of the Alpha variant. And then finally, the big change that's come in the last few months has been taking into account waning of infection-acquired immunity and waning of vaccine-acquired immunity. We're trying to keep abreast of what the virus is showing us and the complexity of what's happening around the world. I think part of the reason that our out-of-sample predictability or model performance has continued to be quite good is because we are trying to essentially keep up with the virus while we learn about it. What will be the consequences of removing mask mandates? Right now, in countries where Omicron is subsiding, there's a pretty rapid move to lift mandates. We're seeing it in some US states, Canadian provinces, many countries in Europe, and discussion elsewhere of similar moves. I think removing the mandates makes sense in settings where we think that most people who are susceptible to Omicron have been infected and the numbers are coming down because we've run out of people to infect. In those settings, the mandates aren't really achieving much at all. And so there should be little to no risk in removing those mandates. In settings, which we don't see a lot of, where there is a lot of behavioral modification, people are avoiding contact, mobility has come way down, and mask use has gone up, then perhaps some of the peaks in Omicron may have been before all the people who are susceptible have been infected \u2013 and then you might get a secondary resurgence if you take the mandates off. But there are not many places where the other data on mobility and mask use would suggest that that's really the driver of the peak, in which case we think removing the mandates will have little to no impact on transmission once you're on the downswing of Omicron. Should China relax its restrictions, and what will happen if it does? The big question with Omicron is what do zero-COVID countries, most importantly China, do? And it's really quite a challenge because we worry most about people who are unvaccinated and never infected, so essentially there's almost nobody in China who's been infected, except a very small percentage of the population from the original outbreak. And you have quite high vaccination rates, but the vaccine isn't particularly effective against Omicron. It's much worse efficacy than say Pfizer or Moderna or AstraZeneca. The challenge that the Chinese government has is how to manage this situation. If there's a strategy ahead where they can deliver a more effective vaccine booster to the over-65s and under-65s with comorbidities \u2013 the vulnerable group \u2013 or they can gain access to intellectual property around antivirals and start producing enough antivirals to start producing a big caseload, then that becomes a way out. You keep up with the rolling lockdowns in each place where an Omicron outbreak occurs until you're ready with those other strategies. But if there isn't going to be that strategy, then continuous rolling lockdown \u2013 because we expect Omicron will just keep reemerging because it's so infectious \u2013 probably becomes infeasible. Right now, that choice on strategy is probably what the Chinese leadership is trying to figure out. We don't think it's feasible to keep Omicron out of the community for very l",

        "With Monkeypox, COVID-19, and subsequent Long COVID symptoms in addition to persistent diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's, the world is dealing with a lot right now. Luckily, the pharmaceutical world has clinical trials underway to address all of them.\n\nSIGA Technologies' product TPOXX (tecovirimat), an antiviral approved in the U.S. for smallpox, is being used under certain conditions for monkeypox, but only under \u201ccompassionate use\u201d in the U.S. The NIH is now involved in developing a U.S.-based randomized clinical trial to evaluate the drug for the treatment of monkeypox disease, which will be conducted by the AIDS Clinical Trials Group.\n\nSyneuRx International announced results from its Phase II trial of SNB01 (pentarlandir), a novel COVID-19 oral antiviral candidate. The trial evaluated 89 patients who had breakthrough or unvaccinated cases of COVID-19 and were given high-dose, low-dose or placebo. Pantarlandir decreased the inflammation caused by the disease and improved overall health. Pantarlandir blocks coronavirus replication.\n\nAstraZeneca and HUTCHMED Tout 49% ORR in NSCLC\n\nThis weekend, AstraZeneca and partner HUTCHMED presented positive Phase II data for a combination of Tagrisso (osimertinib) plus savolitinib. The latter is an oral, potent and highly selective MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) being co-developed by the two companies. Tagrisso is AstraZeneca's irreversible EGFR-TKI, which has a proven impact on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nIn the Phase II SAVANNAH trial, the combination led to an objective response rate (ORR) of 49% in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated (EGFRm) NSCLC with high levels of MET overexpression and/or amplification.\n\nNotably, the highest response rate (52%) was achieved in patients who had not been treated with prior chemotherapy. The results appeared to be highly dependent upon Savolitinib's mechanism of action as patients whose tumors did not show high levels of MET had an ORR of just 9%.\n\nThe results were presented at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer's 2022 World Conference on Lung Cancer in Vienna, Austria.\n\nCymaBay Therapeutics completed enrollment for its Phase III RESPONSE study of seladelpar for Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC). The study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of the drug for patients with PBC who have been using ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA or ursodial) but have not achieved the recommended treatment goal, or who can\u2019t tolerate UDCA. Seladelpar is a first-in-class oral, selective PPAR delta agonist.\n\nEliem Therapeutics reported results from its Phase IIa trial of ETX-810 for lumbosacral radicular pain (LSRP). ETX-810 is a new entity prodrug of the bioactive lipid palmitoylethanolamide (PEA). It is also being evaluated in diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP). The study did not achieve statistically signification separation from placebo on the study\u2019s primary endpoint, which was changed from baseline to week 4 in the weekly average of the daily pain score measured with the Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (PI-NRS). This was consistent with the Phase IIa study of the drug in DPNP. As a result, they are discontinuing the development of the drug.\n\nImmutep presented new data from its Phase II TACTI-002 trial of eftilagimod alpha for first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study hit the primary objective, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 38.6% to the combination of the drug with Merck\u2019s Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and favorable anti-tumor activity. There were also improved secondary endpoints, including Disease Control Rate (DCR) and interim median Progression Free Survival (PFS), across all PD-L1 expression levels. The drug is a soluble LAG-3 fusion protein.\n\nOrca Bio announced its Phase III Precision-T trial is open, enrolling and treating patients. It expects to enroll about 174 patients at more than 20 transplant centers across the U.S. It is studying the safety and efficacy of Orca-T compared to standard-of-care allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Orca-T is an investigational high-precision cell therapy made up of infusions containing regulatory T-cells, conventional T-cells and CD34+ stem cells derived from peripheral blood from either related or unrelated matched donors.\n\nHalozyme Therapeutics announced Roche\u2019s Phase III IMscin001 trial of a subcutaneous formulation of Tecentriq (atezolizumab) with Halozyme\u2019s ENHANZE technology met its co-primary endpoints. The study demonstrated non-inferior levels of Tecentriq in the blood when injected SC compared with IV infusion in cancer immunotherapy-na\u00efve patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC where previous platinum therapy failed.\n\nLandos Biopharma announced positive topline data from its Phase Ib trial of NX-13 for ulcerative colitis. The drug is a novel, oral, NLRX1 agonist, dosed once a day for four weeks. The drug was well tolerated. The company plans to initiate a Phase II trial to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and optimal dosing.\n\nAthira Pharma presented the first results from its Phase II proof-of-concept trial of fosgonimeton in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer\u2019s. The drug is a small-molecule positive modulator of the HGF/MET neurotrophic factor system. The primary outcome analysis (mITT, MMRM) did not meet statistical significance. However, the company indicates the data gave meaningful insights into the drug\u2019s potential effects, including showing its potential activity, which included a decrease in plasma levels of the fluid biomarker, NfL.\n\nNovavax initiated a Phase IIb/III Hummingbird trial to evaluate two doses of its COVID-19 vaccine in younger children ages 6 months through 11 years, followed by a booster at 6 months after the primary vaccination series. The study is expected to enroll 3,600 children in the U.S., Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Spain, UK, South Africa, the Philippines and Brazil.",
        "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals reported a 44% drop in revenue for the second quarter compared to the same period in 2021.\n\nThis overall drop was associated with sales of REGEN-COV, its antibody cocktail against COVID-19, banned in the U.S. in January, with a few exceptions, because it was ineffective against the Omicron variants. Otherwise, company sales were up 20%.\n\nThe real positive drivers were Eylea for chronic eye diseases and Dupixent for inflammatory conditions. Eylea climbed 14% to $1.62 billion. Since 2021, it has brought in $5.79 billion, an increase of 17% from the previous year.\n\nIn a note to investors, Wells Fargo analyst Mohit Bansal wrote, \u201cWe see 2Q22 results as representing a strong beat, with Eylea results showing a strong front against competition from [Roche\u2019s] Vabysmo and continued momentum from Dupixent.\"\n\nDupixent sales jumped almost 40% to $2.09 billion for the second quarter.\n\n\u201cThe second quarter of 2022 was distinguished by record net product sales of Eylea, Dupixent, and Libtayo, as well as multiple regulatory achievements for Dupixent, including U.S. approvals for atopic dermatitis among very young patients and for eosinophilic esophagitis in adults and adolescents, as well as European approval for pediatric asthma,\u201d Dr. Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., president and CEO of Regeneron, said. \u201cIn addition, we have continued to strengthen our oncology franchise, including through the purchase of worldwide rights to Libtayo as well as encouraging but preliminary anti-tumor activity observed at higher doses of our novel PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with Libtayo for advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.\u201d\n\nAs is common with quarterly reports, Regeneron updated its pipeline, including terminating four clinical trials of REGEN-COV. The axed trials include a study of the antibody cocktail in high-risk patients 12 years and younger, a prevention trial in immunocompromised teens and adults, and a study in children hospitalized with COVID-19 and one for non-hospitalized patients. According to clinicaltrials.gov, the studies were terminated because of \u201cemerging SARS-CoV-2 variants impacting susceptibility to study drug.\u201d\n\nRegeneron\u2019s antibody therapy against COVID-19 wasn\u2019t the only such treatment to lose the battle against variants and antiviral drugs. GlaxoSmithKline-Vir Biotechnology\u2019s sotrovimab, as well as Eli Lilly\u2019s bamlanivamab and etesevimab have shown less effectiveness against variants, resulting in modifications to their Emergency Use Authorizations and sales. Largely, they have been replaced by effective vaccines, such as Pfizer\u2019s Paxlovid and Merck\u2019s Lagevrio.\n\nRegeneron has about 35 drugs in clinical development.\n\nThe company\u2019s collaboration revenue with Sanofi increased by 55% to $678 million for the quarter compared to the same period in 2021. Although they have pulled back on this somewhat in recent years, Regeneron has long been dubbed Sanofi\u2019s \u201cinnovation engine.\u201d The increase in revenue was related to shared profits from the commercialization of antibodies and higher Dupixent profits.\n\nRegeneron\u2019s R&D investments were $794 million for the quarter, and Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) were $475 million. The GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.5%, compared to 17.4% in the second quarter of 2021. This was primarily due to the proportion of income earned in foreign sales with lower tax rates than in the U.S.\n\nGAAP net income per diluted share was $7.47 in the quarter, compared to $27.97 in the second quarter of 2021.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased with our second quarter 2022 financial performance, including 20% revenue growth when excluding contributions from REGEN-COV. This demonstrates the continued strength of our core business,\u201d Robert E. Landry, executive vice president, Finance, and CFO of Regeneron, said. \u201cAdditionally, we updated our full-year 2022 financial guidance primarily to reflect the recently completed acquisition of Libtayo global rights from Sanofi, a transaction that we believe will deliver significant shareholder value over time. In the second half of 2022, we look forward to advancing our pipeline with important clinical data readouts in oncology and ophthalmology as well as continued commercial execution and prudent capital allocation to drive value creation for shareholders.\u201d",

        "A faraway galaxy cluster boasts an unusual backward shockwave phenomenon.\n\nGalaxy clusters contain up to thousands of galaxies and tons of plasma in motion.\n\nThe backward shockwave may be from overlapping collisions among subclusters.\n\nScientists from the University of Western Australia and Italy\u2019s Universit\u00e0 di Bologna have been studying an extremely faraway galaxy cluster, Abell 3266, where they\u2019ve identified three phenomena that are unheard of elsewhere\u2014at least so far. And all three emit radio waves that have allowed us to observe them across a distance so far it almost defies units of measure altogether.\n\nAbell 3266 is a galaxy cluster that\u2019s 809 million light years away from Earth in an area known as the Horologium-Reticulum Supercluster. (As you zoom out further and further into space, you see that we, in the Milky Way, are part of a supercluster as well. Some supercluster-like structures we believe to exist are so large they potentially unmake our existing theory of the universe itself!)\n\nIn a piece for the Conversation , a website that publishes content from academics, the scientists explain that the term \u201cgalaxy cluster\u201d is a little bit misleading. Yes, a cluster may contain \u201chundreds, or even thousands\u201d of galaxies, they say, but the overwhelming majority of mass in these clusters is dark matter, with \u201chot plasma \u2018soup\u2019\u201d making up the rest. The Milky Way is made up of an estimated 85 percent dark matter , for example. Galaxies, themselves, make up a measly \u201cfew percent.\u201d\n\nOn Earth, we primarily understand plasma as the makeup of stars, including our sun. But plasma physics is a huge field, since plasma itself is just another state of matter. The more we can examine it in different contexts, the more we can understand\u2014knowledge that may also eventually help people on Earth who work on projects like nuclear fusion energy.\n\nAbell 3266 is \u201ca particularly dynamic\u201d cluster, named for prolific astronomer and public scientist George O. Abell, who surveyed both the northern and southern skies for galaxy clusters during his lifetime. (Abell 3266 is in the southern sky.) While observing the cluster with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder and Australia Telescope Compact Array radio telescopes, the researchers observed three different unusual phenomena: radio relics, radio haloes, and fossil radio sources.\n\nAll three of these phenomena are created by energy slamming into abundant plasma. With radio relics, this reaction sends out shockwaves like the sonic booms we experience on Earth. They themselves aren\u2019t unusual in galaxy clusters, but the one these researchers found is backward. The brightness in this area of the cluster suggests that a shockwave should travel from north to south, but instead it goes from south to north. The researchers dubbed this a \u201cwrong-way\u201d radio relic.\n\nRadio-on-optical overlay of the \u2018wrong-way\u2019 relic to the SE of Abell 3266. Risely et. al\n\nThe researchers say other scientists have begun to observe other backward radio relics in similar work, showing that this is an uncommon, but not nonexistent, phenomenon. And they theorize that the wrong-way radio relics result from not just energy striking plasma, but multiple subclusters striking each other simultaneously. Think about biting down on a crunchy potato chip versus biting down on a crunchy potato chip that was folded over during manufacturing.\n\nIn their paper, published August 1 in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, the researchers present all three radio anomalies with the follow-up note that they all require a lot more study; this paper is kind of an announcement, rather than a conclusion. \u201c[F]urther work is required to fully unpack the history of Abell 3266 and its constituent radio galaxies, and the answers to a number of questions remain elusive,\u201d they conclude.\n\nCaroline Delbert Caroline Delbert is a writer, avid reader, and contributing editor at Pop Mech.\n\nThis content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

        "Using information from ESA\u2019s Swarm satellite mission, scientists have discovered a completely new type of magnetic wave that sweeps across the outermost part of Earth\u2019s outer core every seven years and propagates westward at up to 1 500 km (932 miles) a year. The discovery offers a way to probe the cylindrical radial component of the magnetic field inside Earth\u2019s core.\n\nSince the trio of Swarm satellites was launched in 2013, scientists have been analyzing their data to gain new insight into many of Earth\u2019s natural processes, from space weather to the physics and dynamics of Earth\u2019s stormy heart.\n\nMeasuring our magnetic field from space is the only real way of probing deep down to Earth\u2019s core. Seismology and mineral physics provide information about the material properties of the core, but they do not shed any light on the dynamo-generating motion of the liquid outer core.\n\nBut now, using data from the Swarm mission, scientists have unearthed a hidden secret.\n\n\u201cGeophysicists have long theorized over the existence of such waves, but they were thought to take place over much longer time scales than our research has shown,\u201d said lead author Nicolas Gillet from the University Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes.\n\n\u201cMeasurements of the magnetic field from instruments based on the surface of Earth suggested that there was some kind of wave action, but we needed the global coverage offered by measurements from space to reveal what is actually going on.\n\n\u201cWe combined satellite measurements from Swarm, and also from the earlier German Champ mission and Danish \u00d8rsted mission, with a computer model of the geodynamo to explain what the ground-based data had thrown up \u2013 and this led to our discovery.\u201d\n\nOwing to Earth\u2019s rotation, these waves align in columns along the axis of rotation. The motion and magnetic field changes associated with these waves are strongest near the equatorial region of the core.\n\nWhile the research exhibits magneto-Coriolis waves near a seven-year period, the question of the existence of such waves that would oscillate at different periods, however, remains.\n\n\u201cMagnetic waves are likely to be triggered by disturbances deep within the Earth\u2019s fluid core, possibly related to buoyancy plumes. Each wave is specified by its period and typical length-scale, and the period depends on characteristics of the forces at play. For magneto-Coriolis waves, the period is indicative of the intensity of the magnetic field within the core,\u201d Gillet added.\n\n\u201cOur research suggests that other such waves are likely to exist, probably with longer periods \u2013 but their discovery relies on more research.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis current research is certainly going to improve the scientific model of the magnetic field within Earth\u2019s outer core. It may also give us new insight into the electrical conductivity of the lowermost part of the mantle and also of Earth\u2019s thermal history,\u201d said Ilias Daras, ESA\u2019s Swarm mission scientist.\n\nReferences:\n\n1 Swarm unveils magnetic waves deep down \u2013 ESA \u2013 May 23, 2022\n\n2 Satellite magnetic data reveal interannual waves in Earth\u2019s core \u2013 Nicolas Gillet et al. \u2013 PNAS \u2013 March 21, 2022 \u2013 https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.211525811\n\nFeatured image credit: University Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, ESA",
        "The prehistoric roots of the cold sore herpes virus\n\nHuman herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is the common causes of lip- and coldsores and is estimated to infect 3.7 billion people under the age of 50. Now, recently ancient genomes suggest that the herpes virus strain behind facial herpes arose around five thousand years ago.\n\nPreviously, genetic data for herpes only went back to 1925, but researchers were able to extract samples from the remains of four ancient individuals stretching over a thousand-year period \u2013 the oldest of which dated back to the late Iron Age around 1,500 years ago.\n\nOne of the samples of ancient herpes DNA used in the study came from a male of 26-35 years old, excavated near the banks of the Rhine. The man was a fervent smoker of clay pipes. Traces of the habit are visible in multiple places on the teeth, where the hard clay pipe, usually put in the same place in the mouth, has worn the teeth. Credit: Dr Barbara Veselka\n\n\u201cBy comparing ancient DNA with herpes samples from the 20th century, we were able to analyse the differences and estimate a mutation rate, and consequently a timeline for virus evolution,\u201d explains co-lead author Dr Lucy van Dorp, from the Genetics Institute at the University College London in the UK.\n\nThis calculation led to the estimate that 5,000 years ago something happened that allowed one strain of herpes to overtake all others. The authors of the new study, published in Science Advances, suggest it may have coincided with the arrival of a new cultural practice introduced from the east: romantic and sexual kissing.\n\nStickers that can see inside the body\n\nEngineers have designed a stamp-sized device that sticks to skin and can provide continuous ultrasound imaging of internal organs for 48 hours \u2013 according to a new study published in Science.\n\nThe ultrasound sticker produces high resolution images by pairing a stretchy adhesive layer with a rigid array of transducers. The adhesive layer is made from two thin layers of elastomer encapsulating a middle layer of solid hydrogel. Ultrasound transducers convert electrical energy into sound energy and back again, to produce and detect sound waves.\n\n\u201cThis combination enables the device to conform to the skin while maintaining the relative location of transducers to generate clearer and more precise images,\u201d says co-lead author Chonghe Wang, a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, US.\n\nThe current design requires the stickers be connected to instruments that translate the reflected sound waves into images, but the team is working toward wireless devices that could be wearable imaging products for patients.\n\nMIT engineers designed an adhesive patch that produces ultrasound images of the body.

But accurately simulating liquid flow remains one of the most computationally challenging aspects of modelling the real world, because it involves precisely calculating complex and time-varying pressure distributions within the liquid.\n\nNow, researchers have made a significant breakthrough in computational speed for modelling viscous liquids, by combining efficient mathematics with the low-level parallel computational capabilities of modern computer processors, according to a new study in ACM Transactions on Graphics.\n\n\u201cIn this research, we propose the Unsmoothed Aggregation Algebraic Multigrid method as a sophisticated multigrid framework that fully utilises modern CPU features and introduces new numerical methods,\u201d explains co-author Han Shao, a PhD student in Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cOur framework can be used immediately by industrial users for faster simulation, using the code available on our project website.\u201d\n\nA state-of-the-art method for modeling the behavior of liquids described by KAUST researchers represents a breakthrough in computational speed for viscous liquids.

Similar versions of the lures have been found on islands across the Pacific before, but these are the oldest known examples of their kind.\n\nThe lures use at least one piece of cowrie shell (Cypraea) \u2013 a type of sea snail \u2013 lashed onto a sinking stone, which is then dropped into the water and manipulated by an attached fibre line. The shell cap and an attached stick mimics the octopus\u2019 favourite snail food, luring it out and either activating a hook on the lure or being caught by spear, net, or by hand.\n\nRadiocarbon dating of archaeological layers in the ground was used to confirm the ages of the artefacts, which were excavated between 2011 to 2016. The research has been published in the journal World Archaeology.\n\n(Top image) A re-created example of an ancient octopus lure from Tonga housed at the Pitt Rivers Museum in England.

Researchers from the University of Western Australia, CSIRO and University of Tasmania studied Antarctica\u2019s sub-ice geology along the continent\u2019s Amundsen and Siple Coasts, Wilkes Land and Recovery regions, and found sedimentary basins beneath the ice at low-level positions of Earth\u2019s crust. These basins contain large volumes of groundwater. As glaciers retreat, the basins can discharge the groundwater, which in turn leads to an increased rate of ice loss. The increase in global ocean and surface temperatures due to climate change is the driving force behind the loss of 150 billion tonnes of ice on average each year. Ice melt in turn adds to ongoing sea level rise.",
        "Children who develop myocarditis because of an mRNA vaccine typically experience \u201cmild and self-resolving\u201d symptoms, according to Victorian doctors.\n\nMyocarditis \u2013 or inflammation of the heart\u2013 is a known but rare side-effect of the mRNA vaccines.\n\nA report published in the Medical Journal of Australia is the largest for a single children\u2019s hospital, with data studied from 33 adolescents who presented to Monash Children\u2019s Hospital with diagnosed or probable myocarditis.\n\nData suggest it is more likely experienced as a complication of COVID-19, rather than from the vaccination against the disease.\n\nBased on the Therapeutic Goods Administration\u2019s most recent COVID-19 vaccine safety report, it occurs in around 2 in 100,000 those to receive the Moderna or Pfizer vaccinations, although it is slightly more common in boys aged 12-17 and men 18-29.\n\nIn general, symptoms experienced by patient at Monash Children\u2019s Hospital were mild and required no major treatment.\n\nAll case recovered with the administration of ibuprofen and an average hospital stay of 2.3 days.\n\nIt\u2019s an encouraging finding that should give parents of children peace-of-mind, says one of the report\u2019s authors Dr Suraj Varma, a paediatric cardiologist at Monash Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nGet an update of science stories delivered straight to your inbox.\n\n\u201cThe traditional forms of myocarditis can be very serious,\u201d Varma tells Cosmos.\n\nThe kids who presented with myocarditis after vaccination have had a very mild disease, as far as clinical findings are concerned.\n\n\u201cAnd since writing the paper, we\u2019ve had follow-up at three-to-six months for some of them, and all of them are doing very well, without any problems, and they are back to their usual sports and school and activities which is incredibly reassuring.\n\nVarma says traditional forms of myocarditis can be very serious, including with admission to ICU. It is also more likely to occur, and with greater severity, in unvaccinated people.\n\n\u201cAnd even though there is a small risk of side effects associated with the vaccine, the risk with not getting the vaccine is at least 10 times higher,\u201d Varma says.\n\n\u201cSo if you got COVID-19, your risk of having significant problems was much, much higher than any potential side effects that could be occurring after taking the vaccine.\u201d\n\nThe patients whose data was analysed as part of this study will be followed up one year after their discharge from hospital.\n\n\u201cWith the way things are going, it\u2019s remained a mild disease so far, which is very reassuring.\u201d\n\nOver 95% of the population has received two doses of approved vaccines, and no more than 2 in 100,000 to receive an mRNA-based vaccine experience myocarditis, so the risk of the side-effect remains very low.",

        "Solar is one of the most well-known renewable energy sources , but harnessing it for personal use has been difficult, especially if you're unable to install permanent panels on the top of your home. The EF ECOFLOW Solar Generator Delta Max and Solar Panel Bundle aims to change that, and it succeeds if your needs fall within its power output limitations.\n\nBefore we get into the tech specs, it's important to report that this bundle costs $2,199 at the time this review is being published. That's a big investment to make, especially when you consider the fact that six rooftop solar panels can cost up to $400 less. The difference is that EF ECOFLOW's bundle includes a ultra high-capacity battery to store the energy absorbed by the solar panel. The energy can be used immediately, or saved for emergency situations or multi-day camping trips. This bundle may elicit some immediate sticker shock, but EF ECOFLOW has actually knocked $550 off its original price tag due a price reduction and free coupon provided when you shop on Amazon.\n\nWhat is the EF Ecoflow Delta Max Solar Generator Bundle?\n\nSpecs:\n\nEF ECOFLOW Delta Max\n\n\u2014 Size: 19.6 H X 9.5 L 12 W Inches\n\n\u2014 Weight: 47.9 pounds\n\n\u2014 Capacity: 2,016 WH (watt hours)\n\n\u2014 Ports: Two USB-C, four USB-C, 2 DC, one car output, six AC outputs\n\n\u2014 Maximum Power Output: 2400W (watts)\n\nEF ECOFLOW 220W Solar Panel\n\n\u2014 Size: 32.3 L x 72 W x 1 inches\n\n\u2014 Weight: 20.9 pounds\n\n\u2014 Maximum Power Output: 220W\n\n\u2014 Number of Panels: Four\n\nMy interest in solar energy has led me to trying out low-powered panels from companies like Grouphug and Anker, which are designed to charge portable electronics like a smartphone, tablet, or handheld game console. While impressive for their size, these solar panels lack the power output necessary to charge or run larger gadgets, be they laptops or small appliances. EF ECOFLOW's 220W solar panel can absorb and convert far more energy from the sun, and the Delta Max allows you to easily use it to power much more demanding gadgets. These are the most powerful sustainability tools I've tested in my career, and they've recalibrated my expectations for solar powered technology in the future.\n\nSetup\n\nIf you've never used a solar panel before, you'll be happy to learn that EF ECOFLOW has made the setup process pretty painless. Using its instructions, I was able to set up the 220W Solar Panel and connect it to the Delta Max in about 20 minutes. It's important to recognize that I did need the help of a friend to set up the solar panel because it's several feet long when it's fully unfolded. This makes it unwieldy to move around as one person. You may be able to assemble it on your own if you lean the panel against the side of a house, or other tall, sturdy surface.\n\nSetting up EF ECOFLOW's solar panel had three basic steps: removing it from the included carrying case, unfolding it to reveal its four-panel array, and attaching the panel to its opened carrying case using a set of included clips and straps. That last step is what required me to seek a friend's help. The opened case acts as a stand for the solar panel, and angles it upward to absorb the sun's rays more effectively. Attaching the two pieces to one another is pretty simple because the solar panel has holes on its top and bottom edges, so you'll know the exact places to hook the case onto. I shouldn't have been surprised that EF ECOFLOW's solar panel case could be used for more than just protection and easy transportation, but I was.\n\nWith the solar panel set up, it was time to connect it to the Delta Max Solar Generator. This gadget looked imposing, and weighed a ton, but was incredibly easy to use. All I had to do was connect the solar panel's power cable to a port on the Delta Max. The solar generator instantly recognized the solar panel and began charging. The Delta Max's screen showed its current charging rate (measured in watts), along with how many hours it would take to fully recharge the battery inside. This was extremely helpful because it let me know whether I had to move the solar panel around, or adjust its angle. It's common sense that a solar panel will be more effective when you move it away from shade cast by a tree or the side of a house; knowing that a half turn to the left can increase the panel's effectiveness by 15 percent is much less intuitive.\n\nFirst Impressions\n\nI tested the solar panel's efficiency in a couple of spots on the front lawn of a suburban home on a sunny day, and saw firsthand how much moving it around can make. In a slightly shaded area, EF ECOFLOW's solar panel was only transferring energy to the Delta Max at a rate of between 10 and 20 watts. It would have taken dozens of hours to charge it up at that rate. By moving it into a sunny spot, the solar panel was charging the Delta Max at a rate of 140 watts, and would recharge the solar generator in 11 hours. Yes, that's still a long time, but the difference was remarkable. It should be said that you can charge the Delta Max by plugging it into an outlet \u2014 which admittedly takes less time because there's no variability in how much energy it's absorbing \u2014 so you're not out of luck if weather is crummy.\n\nThe bundle I was sent for review had a single solar panel, but you can hook two of them up to the Delta Max at one time. Under optimal conditions, you can charge the Delta Max at a rate of up to 440 watts. Based on my experience, that'd mean being able to fully recharge the Delta Max in just between five to six hours. Each solar panel costs $549, though, which makes its very expensive proposition. We hope that improvements in manufacturing processes lead to price cuts on solar panels over the next few years regardless of the manufacturer. EF ECOFLOW says you can use any solar panels that use the same \"EcoFlow Solar Connectors,\" aka plugs that can connect to the ports found on the Delta Max.\n\nSpace and Charging Considerations\n\nA persistent problem you may have when using a solar panel to charge the Delta Max is finding enough space to set it up. The solar panel requires several feet of clearance when it's unfolded, which makes it a no-go in crowded areas, including densely populated public campgrounds. If you have the luxury of a front or backyard that gets good sun coverage, or take trips to a private campground there's no doubt that EF ECOFLOW's bundle of a solar panel and the Delta Max can help you use renewable energy more easily, but space is an absolute necessity. It's worth noting that the EF ECOFLOW's solar panel is pretty compact when it's folded up. This is helpful for both at-home storage and for times when you want to pack the solar panel up in your car. The solar panel's protective case has a handle, which makes it easy to carry around, too.\n\nAt first glance, EF ECOFLOW's Delta Max may look like the more boring part of the company's sustainability tech bundle because it can be written off as a huge battery pack. That's true to some extent, but the Delta Max is so well constructed and thoughtfully designed that it's worth recommending on its own. The 48-pound solar generator has a capacity of 2016 WH (watt Hours) and can output up to 2,400 watts of electricity at a time. EF ECOFLOW says the Delta Max can be fully recharged in about 65 minutes when connected to an outlet using the included AC adapter, though I stuck to solar charging during my tests.\n\nThe Delta Max's high battery capacity and generous number of outputs makes it a natural choice for campers, or anyone who wants to be prepared to power their essential electronics in the event of a blackout. The frontside of the Delta Max features two 100-watt USB-C PD (Power Delivery) ports and four USB-A ports, two of which support fast charging speeds. These ports are perfect for charging smartphones, tablets, game consoles, headphones, Bluetooth speakers, and all manner of other portable electronic devices. I connected a handful of gadgets from these categories to the Delta Max at once and all of them started charging immediately.\n\nThe Delta Max's front side also houses its LED color display, which shows how much power it's outputting in real time, and how many hours it can run before running out of juice. This is extremely helpful information because it'll help you moderate your energy use to avoid dealing with a dead battery. The Delta Max's screen also includes the traditional battery percentage number, which ticks down as you use it. You can check the solar generator's energy levels by staring at the screen, but you also have the option to monitor that information on the go using the EcoFlow mobile app. The app is entirely optional, and is not required to use the Delta Max. That said, it was helpful to keep tabs on its battery levels when I wasn't in the same room.\n\nUsing this feature requires you to create an EcoFlow account, and keep the Delta Max in an area where it can maintain a strong connection to an active WiFi connection. The app walks you through the process of how to connect the power generator to your phone, and eventually the internet, and is pretty user-friendly. Overall, I'm happy that the app exists, but glad it's not a requirement.\n\nOn the back of the Delta Max, you'll find six AC outlets, a car power outlet, and two DC outlets. The car power outlet was of particular interest to me because one of the gadgets I rely on regularly is a tire inflator that's powered using that connector. Sure enough, the inflator sprang to life when I plugged it in and hit its power button. I'll always keep the tire inflator in my car, but it's good to know that I can rely on the Delta Max if I decide to inflate bike tires indoors. While the solar generator's car power outlet served one of my niche needs, its AC plugs are the real stars of the show. These ports allow you to use the Delta Max to power appliances like coffee makers, microwaves, and toasters, or high-powered electronics like big-screen TVs and party speakers.\n\nBattery Power\n\nMy big battery test was using the Delta Max to charge an electric bicycle. In one hour, the solar generator charged the bike's battery by approximately 30 percent (its screen doesn't show battery percentages) while draining the Delta Max by only 7 percent. During that test, the Delta Max displayed that it was outputting power at a rate of approximately 120 watts, and could sustain that level of energy output for 14 hours. That means I could fully recharge the bike several times before having to top up the Delta Max. Since I used solar energy to charge it, my entire e-bike charging system used 100 percent renewable energy. It may seem a little idealistic considering the price and space requirements of EF ECOFLOW's bundle, but it was the highlight of my testing time with these gadgets.\n\nEF ECOFLOW says the Delta Max should last 800 recharge cycles, which may seem alarmingly low at first, but makes sense if you take a step back. This isn't an inexpensive battery pack you'll drain and recharge after a day of casual use, it's designed for extreme conditions like camping or multi-day blackouts. You may only recharge the Delta Max once per month, in which case the solar generator would last 66 years without needing to be replaced. If you charged it once a week, the Delta Max could continue to hold a charge for 15 years. You may also be worried about the Delta Max slowly losing its charge while sitting on a shelf between charges, but I didn't find that to be the case. The solar generator kept the exact level of charge after two weeks of not being used. You should check the Delta Max once every couple of months to make sure it hasn't lost a charge, but I wouldn't worry too much about it.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThree final observations about the Delta Max that stood out to me. First, its weight didn't turn out to be much of an issue because of the handles on either side of its top piece, which made it easy to move around. The solar generator still weighs close to 50 pounds, but the handles helped a lot. Second, you need to press a button on the front and back of the Delta Max to turn on its two sets of ports. This prevents the solar generator from supplying energy to both sets of ports when only one set is required, saving power. Third, the Delta Max's screen will show the ports that are currently being used by displaying a small picture of it beneath the battery indicator. The utility of these three design details didn't occur to me at the time, but stuck out upon reflection.\n\nThe price of EF ECOFLOW's bundle is pretty steep, but fully worthwhile when you consider how well both its solar panel and solar generator perform. The fact that the Delta Max has the flexibility to be charged independently of the solar panel, or with multiple panels connected, makes it an especially compelling tool to use during parking lot tailgates, beach parties, and other gatherings. The age of consumer-level solar charging equipment has begun, and if the gear I've tested from EF ECOFLOW is any indication, it couldn't come quickly enough.\n\nBuy Now\n\nThis post was created by a non-news editorial team at Recurrent Media, Futurism\u2019s owner.

        "It's really that easy.\n\nTurning Heads\n\nResearchers have stumbled upon an astonishingly simple trick to unmask anybody trying to get away with using live deepfake software on a video call: ask them to turn their head to the side.\n\nAccording to a new blog post by AI software company Metaphysic, many contemporary deepfake programs simply aren't great at recreating the profile of somebody's face. As soon as these deepfakes' heads turn 90 degrees to either side, the otherwise photorealistic illusion falls apart.\n\nThe trick could come in handy in the near future \u2014 think of this as a potential CAPTCHA for deepfakes. As the Better Business Bureau and even the FBI recently warned us, scammers could easily make use of the technology to steal money or sensitive information.\n\nDeep Limitations\n\nThe trick works because most deepfake algorithms are based on mostly front-on facial alignments. In fact, most of the visual content that exists out there most of the time doesn't include profile shots \u2014 because it simply isn't desired.\n\n\"The profile is a big problem for current deepfake technologies,\" Siwei Lyu, professor of computer science and engineering at the University at Buffalo, told Metaphysic.\n\n\"Probably the best an algorithm can do is to roughly estimate the profile, particularly if the person is enacting various expressions, or taking requests from the other correspondent in a video call, or from an automated liveness detection system,\" Lyu added. \"In a case like that, profile estimation is going to be kind of a \u2018guess\u2019, even if you were to have some depth information from some of the more recent sensors in smartphones.\"\n\nBut there are ways around the limitation as well. For instance, the entire head could be replaced with a photorealistic CGI model. With 3D body-scanning technologies, a scammer could conceivably turn their own likeness into somebody else's.\n\nWhile deepfake technologies may have made big strides in recent years, there are some surprisingly easy ways for us to tell truth from fiction. But since time immemorial, fraudsters have found new ways to hide their identities online \u2014 expect them to eventually figure this one out, too.\n\nREAD MORE: To Uncover a Deepfake Video Call, Ask the Caller to Turn Sideways [Metaphysic]\n\n\n\nMore on deepfakes: Eerie Deepfake Tech Turns Random Guy Into Angelina Jolie\n\n",
        "In a laboratory experiment, a strong T-cell response against the coronaviruses that cause common cold-like symptoms was linked to greater covid-19 immunity\n\nAntibodies attacking SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that can cause covid-19 Shutterstock/Kateryna Kon\n\nPeople with a stronger immune response to the coronaviruses that cause common cold-like symptoms may be better protected against covid-19, raising hopes that a pan-coronavirus vaccine could be achieved.\n\nRicardo da Silva Antunes at La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California and his colleagues analysed blood samples collected from 32 people between 2016 and 2019, before covid-19 emerged.\n\nMultiple samples were taken from each person over six months to three years. The team wanted to see how the immune cells in these samples responded to four coronaviruses that cause common cold-like symptoms as well as the original SARS-CoV-2 strain, which emerged in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithin the coronavirus class, seven strains are known to infect humans. Of these, four viruses cause common cold-like symptoms. There is also SARS-CoV, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); MERS-CoV, which causes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS); and SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the ongoing pandemic.\n\nAntunes says it was important to use samples taken before the pandemic. \u201cThis means that when we\u2019re looking at our results, we know that they are caused by pre-existing immune memory and that they\u2019re not contaminated by people\u2019s immune responses to SARS-CoV-2.\u201d\n\nSARS-CoV-2 has similar genetic sequences to the four common cold-like coronaviruses, says Antunes. Previous studies also suggest that stronger T-cell responses induced by prior coronaviruses may protect against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIn the latest study, the researchers combined the participants\u2019 blood with peptides \u2013 strings of amino acids \u2013 from the different coronaviruses. Immune responses are typically triggered by the body recognising the peptides of a virus. Next, they measured the T-cell and antibody responses in the blood when exposed to these viruses.\n\nLooking at multiple samples from each participant, the researchers found the T-cell and antibody responses were stable and persistent for all four common cold-like coronaviruses.\n\nBy looking at the T-cells, some of which are more likely to be activated by recent re-infections, they determined these immune responses weren\u2019t due to regular re-infections. Instead, this immune response may be relatively stable.\n\nAntunes speculates that if these common cold-like coronaviruses elicit similar immune responses, it may generate a stable immune memory.\n\nRead more: One in 8 people got long covid after infection early in the pandemic\n\nIn the second part of the experiment, the researchers combined the participants\u2019 blood with SARS-CoV-2. They found that those with the strongest T-cell immune response to the common cold-like coronaviruses had the strongest response to SARS-CoV-2. The same wasn\u2019t found for antibody levels.\n\nBut the participants with stronger responses against common cold-like coronaviruses weren\u2019t necessarily less likely to experience severe covid-19, says Antunes. \u201cThe link between [the common] cold response and SARS-CoV-2 response is still not clear,\u201d he says. Assuming most people have been exposed to common cold-like coronaviruses throughout their life, it isn\u2019t clear why some still become severely ill with covid-19.\n\nOverall, similar findings are expected with newer SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as omicron, as the mutations that result in these variants haven\u2019t been found to affect the T-cell response much, says Antunes.\n\nAccording to Mala Maini at University College London, the study adds to the evidence that suggests T-cell immunity to common cold-like coronaviruses shapes our SARS-CoV-2 response.\n\nHer team is working on a pan-coronavirus vaccine that targets a genetic sequence shared between SARS-CoV-2 and common cold-like coronaviruses.\n\nJournal reference: Cell Host & Microbe, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2022.07.012\n\nSir Patrick Vallance on his role during the covid-19 pandemic Patrick Vallance at New Scientist Live this October",
        "In an amazing feat of human ingenuity and teamwork, the first COVID-19 vaccine was designed, developed, tested, and authorized for emergency use in December 2020. Not only was this normally lengthy process completed in less than a year, it also introduced the novel use of modified mRNA to induce an immune response against an infection. These mRNA vaccines effectively generate antibodies and prevent infection and hospitalization. However, scientists did not know how mRNA vaccines compared to more common vaccine methods nor the mechanism by which COVID-19 vaccines induced long-term immunity.\n\nResearchers compared multiple COVID-19 vaccines to compare efficacy and long-term immunity.\n\nTo answer these questions, Shane Crotty and his group at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology performed a head-to-head comparison of four currently used COVID-19 vaccines that target the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein: Pfizer/BioNtech (mRNA), Moderna (mRNA), Janssen/J&J (adenovirus), and Novavax (recombinant protein). In a six-month longitudinal study published in Cell, the researchers examined blood samples from vaccinated and recently infected people for SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific immune responses.\n\nIn this study, Crotty sought to standardize the methods by which scientists compared these different vaccines. While it\u2019s clear that mRNA vaccines are successful, comparing vaccines in different scientific studies using multiple types of assays remained a challenge. \u201cWe spent 15 months recruiting people and collecting samples so that we could actually run everything in the same labs, on the same machines with controls, so we could really do the head-to-head, high-quality comparison across four different vaccines, which was a big deal, but also against three different kinds of vaccines, which was an even bigger deal,\u201d said Crotty.\n\nCrotty\u2019s experiments revealed some striking results. When compared to samples from primary infections, all vaccines were just as, if not more, effective in inducing a SARS-CoV-2-specific long-term immune response that lasted up to six months. By analyzing the presence of memory B and T cells and measuring their response to in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection, the researchers found that mRNA vaccines are just as effective as the traditional protein-based vaccination methods. They also found some notable differences between the vaccine types. \u201cThe most exciting data was to see that in the B cell side of the story, we saw that a g-coupled chemokine receptor called CXCR3 was increased in memory B cells in response to the adenovirus-based vaccine,\u201d said Camila Coelho, a researcher in the Crotty lab and an author of the study. The researchers did not see this phenomenon in the mRNA vaccinated patients. According to Crotty, the consequences of this are still unknown, but these similarities and differences highlight the fact that there is still much to learn about the immune system and vaccine efficacy.\n\n\u201cWe can go forward with this as a common way of making vaccines against new systemic infections.\u201d\n\nSuresh Marulasiddappa, University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\n\n\n\u201cI think this has confirmed that the mRNA vaccines are actually a pretty good deal,\u201d said Suresh Marulasiddappa, a professor of immunology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who was not involved in the study. \u201cWe can go forward with this as a common way of making vaccines against new systemic infections.\u201d\n\nThe Crotty lab has big plans for the future. \u201cWe are interested in the durability of immunity in people who received the booster and also who get breakthrough infections,\u201d said Zeli Zhang, a postdoctoral fellow working with Crotty and the first author of the study. \u201cWe would like to see what the immunity in these people looks like after six months\u2026or even one year.\u201d\n\nReference",
        "ABOVE: Lindsey Baden Credit: Len Rubenstein\n\nIn April of 2022, almost two and a half years into the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 40 percent of the US population had yet to contract SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Thanks to the highly transmissible BA.5 variant, that percentage is probably smaller now, but there are still some people who don\u2019t seem to have ever had an infection\u2014or at least, they\u2019ve never had symptoms or tested positive. SARS-CoV-2 infections can be totally asymptomatic, and the variant in question as well as other factors can influence testing accuracy, raising the possibility that a person could have had COVID-19 and not been aware of it. In addition to leaving many wondering whether they\u2019ve actually caught the virus, this kind of uncertainty also causes headaches for epidemiologists, especially those who want to track community spread.\n\nGenerally, testing for prior infections involves looking for antibodies that bind to viral proteins, particularly those that target SARS-CoV-2\u2019s nucleocapsid (N) protein (anti-N antibodies), as the available vaccines teach the immune system to spot the virus using its spike (S) protein instead (anti-S antibodies). However, a study published last month in Annals of Internal Medicine finds that antibody testing likely undercounts the number of vaccinated people who have had a previous COVID-19 infection, potentially by as much as 40 percent.\n\nSo, is there any reliable way to test for a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection? The Scientist spoke to Lindsey Baden, an infectious disease specialist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Massachusetts, to find out.\n\nThe Scientist: Why is it important to know if people have had a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection?\n\nLindsey Baden: Given that a fair amount of COVID is asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, there are a lot of infections that people don\u2019t realize they\u2019ve had. So it becomes important to understand how much transmission there is in the community to help with epidemiologic studies and other types of studies that better define the burden of infection and transmission.\n\nTS: What are the methods scientists and researchers use to determine if someone has had a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection?\n\nLB: To measure the footprints of the virus after infection, we use molecular markers or antibodies, such as the nucleocapsid antibody.\n\nWhat\u2019s important to note is that the widely used vaccines in the US and Europe . . . are largely based on the spike protein. In this case, the immune response to the spike protein could either be from natural infection or from vaccination. An immune response to the nucleoprotein can only be from exposure to the virus. That isn\u2019t true everywhere in the world, because there are parts of the world that use inactivated COVID vaccines, which have the whole virus. There, some of the nucleoprotein may be present and therefore stimulate that immune response.\n\nTS: How accurate are serological tests in determining if someone has had a SARS-CoV-2 infection?\n\nLB: That\u2019s a terrific question that\u2019s more complicated than it seems, because one of the things that we have to do [when we] deal with a new virus is understand the immune response to that virus. We have to understand if it behaves like . . . other pathogens. So we are in the process of learning how well these serological tests behave, given that we\u2019ve only been dealing with SARS-CoV-2 for two and a half years. There\u2019s no way for us to know if the immune responses last for three years because we haven\u2019t dealt with the virus that long. One of the other issues is understanding the biology of this immune response. Are there factors that can alter it, such as prior vaccination and then infection? Does that change the way in which the immune response [is] elicited? This is an area of active research.\n\nTS: How long can we typically detect anti-N or anti-S antibodies?\n\nLB: Typically, there\u2019s a decay [in antibody responses] over a year or two\u2014or that\u2019s what we think from natural infection because that\u2019s what would induce this type of antibody response.\n\nWhat came from the Annals study was showing that by vaccinating, we alter some of the immune kinetics.\n\nTS: Is there any way that scientists can definitively determine if someone has had a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection?\n\nLB: I think the nucleocapsid antibody response is very reliable. But what we\u2019re learning is that in people that have been vaccinated, an immune response may not be elicited. There are a variety of other immune response[s] that can be looked at, like antibody responses to other viral proteins and T cell responses.\n\nT cells . . . react to specific viral epitopes, often short protein sequences. And so one can look for T cell responses against other parts of the viral genome that are not part of the vaccine, basically looking at if T cells can detect those proteins. These methods could be useful. One would only have an immune response to those proteins if you\u2019ve seen them before. One has to be careful about cross-reaction to other coronaviruses and you have to choose sequences that are unique to SARS-CoV-2, but that\u2019s easily done in the laboratory. But these methods aren\u2019t validated yet and we don\u2019t know how accurate they are.\n\n[This avenue of research] helps us define with detail . . . who\u2019s infected or not, but it\u2019s not scalable [to] a population level. That\u2019s why we use antibody responses\u2014[they\u2019re] very fast, easily deployed laboratory tests that can measure nucleocapsid antibod[ies] and therefore screen thousands and thousands of samples in a lab in a day.\n\nTS: Is there any method that would be the most accurate?\n\nLB: I\u2019m not sure we have that information. What came from the Annals study was showing that by vaccinating, we alter some of the immune kinetics. Part of what we have to realize with COVID is we\u2019re learning as we go. As the virus changes and as our response to the virus changes, that may alter the biology, and we have to study it to understand it. It may well be that if you have such a mild infection, you don\u2019t even stimulate an immune response. At some level, that may not be a bad thing, as long as it\u2019s not being spread to vulnerable people. So we have to think carefully about what we mean by protection from COVID. The immune system can abort infections at a very early stage, if it\u2019s primed. This has gone on with many other viruses over decades, or millennia, actually, in terms of other viruses that we\u2019ve all learned to live with.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This interview has been edited for brevity.",
        "A solar storm slammed into Earth over the weekend, and it's possible that another one could strike later on Monday (Aug. 8).\n\nClassified as \"moderate\" by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction Center (opens in new tab), the G2 geomagnetic storm, which pummeled our planet on Sunday (Aug. 7), was the result of a solar wind stream, or charged particles from the sun, striking Earth's magnetic field. A second storm, classified as a G1 or \"minor\" storm, may hit sometime today, NOAA predicted.\n\nAccording to SpaceWeather.com (opens in new tab), the weekend storm, which was not forecasted and came \"unexpectedly,\" reached speeds of up to 373 miles per second (600 kilometers per second). Solar winds have been known to reach speeds of 500 miles per second (800 km) according to Space.com .\n\nIf another storm does hit, NOAA reported that high-latitude power systems could be impacted, which could potentially lead to issues for power grids and GPS devices. Spacecraft in orbit also could be affected, due to an increase in high-energy electrons within the magnetosphere , as well as animal behavior, as some migratory animals rely on Earth's magnetic field to navigate, Newsweek (opens in new tab) reported.\n\nRelated: Solar storm from hole in the sun will hit Earth on Wednesday (Aug. 3)\n\nThe sun is spitting out solar storms left and right these days, as it's reaching the peak of its roughly 11-year cycle, Live Science previously reported. Because of this, it's more likely that sunspots, which NASA (opens in new tab) defines as areas of the sun that appear dark due to being cooler than elsewhere on the sun's surface, will likely pop up, resulting in additional solar events. These spots appear cooler and darker than their surroundings due to strong magnetic fields inhibiting the influx of hot, new gas from the sun's interior, according to Space.com .\n\nThe ensuing solar storm sent social media ablaze, particularly in North America, where people were uploading aurora, or Northern Lights , sightings of the sky bursting into brilliant shades of purple and red.\n\nTamitha Skov, a space physicist who goes by the pseudonym \"Space Weather Woman,\" tweeted on Sunday: \"We've jumped to G2-levels, mainly due to north-south-north flipping of the solar magnetic field.\" Every 11 years, the sun\u2019s magnetic poles will flip, causing the south pole to become the north pole and vice versa, according to the Australian Academy of Science (opens in new tab).\n\nThe NOAA ranks solar storms on a five-level scale, with G5 being the highest. The worst solar storm ever documented occurred in 1859 and is known as the Carrington Event. During that historic storm, the aurora borealis was seen as far south as Hawaii, and telegraph equipment sparked so wildly that offices were set on fire, according to Space.com .\n\nOriginally published on Live Science.",

        "Binge eating disorder is part of a group of mental illnesses known as eating disorders. It is grouped with anorexia nervosa, bulimia, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) and other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED), all of which are conditions where patients display unhealthy relationships with food and disordered eating patterns.\n\nThose with an eating disorder may find themselves eating too much or too little, or worrying excessively about weight or body image. While anyone can get an eating disorder at any time of life, binge eating disorder is most common in those in their late teens and early twenties.\n\nBinge eating disorder is characterized by eating large amounts of food in a short space of time. These so-called \u2018binges\u2019 are often planned ahead of time, involve \u2018special\u2019 or usually restricted foods, and are undertaken alone. There is often a lot of shame and emotional turmoil associated with a binge session, and a binge may be followed by a period of restriction in an attempt to \u2018get back on track\u2019.\n\nHere, we\u2019ll look into the symptoms of binge eating disorder, treatments and diagnostic processes, as well as available support. This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice. A medical doctor or GP should always be the first step in helping assess the severity of an eating disorder and providing support.\n\nWhat is binge eating disorder?\n\nAccording to a review in the journal of Psychiatric Clinics of North America (opens in new tab), binge eating disorder as the most common eating disorder, with the Osteopathic Family Physician (opens in new tab) journal stating that less than half of people with binge eating disorder will receive treatment. Additionally, 3.5% of American women and 2% of American men will experience an eating disorder at some point in their lifetimes, as stated in the journal of Biological Psychiatry (opens in new tab).\n\nDarren Woodward, a qualified psychotherapist and the principal of livelife (opens in new tab), outlines binge eating disorder and the warning signs that someone may be developing this condition. \u201cBinge eating disorder is when a person eats in a short period of time (for example, within any two-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat in a similar period of time under similar circumstances,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen people eat these large quantities of food, they can feel like they are not in control.\u201d\n\nWhat are the symptoms of binge eating disorder?\n\nMarianna Ashurova, a medical doctor and interim physician-in-charge for the Eating Disorders Program at Cohen Children\u2019s Medical Center in New York, explains symptoms that raise flags for eating disorder professionals. \u201cBinge eating disorder is a clinical diagnosis made by a trained provider that includes symptoms such as eating larger amounts of food than the average person may in one sitting, along with feeling a lack of control over consumption,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cPeople will often describe eating past being comfortably full, eating rapidly or in secret, and feeling disgusted by their food consumption. This occurs about once a week for three months. Binge eating disorder is associated with different risk factors including being overweight, high dissatisfaction with body image, and dieting behaviors. A history of emotional or physical abuse, as well as food insecurity and lack of availability in childhood, are implicated as risk factors as well. For many, binge eating can be used as a method of emotional regulation, placing more emotionally vulnerable populations at higher risk.\u201d\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nDespite the prevalence of eating disorders in certain populations, black, indiginous and people of color are half as likely to receive treatment than white people, according to a Harvard School of Public Health (opens in new tab) report into the economic cost of eating disorders. A NEDA (opens in new tab) report into eating disorders in the LGBTQ+ community found that gay men are seven times more likely to report binge-eating and 12 times more likely to report purging than heterosexual men. Another study in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry (opens in new tab) found that 20-30% of adults with eating disorders also have autism.\n\nWoodward explains that secrecy is often an element in binge eating disorder. \u201cThis could involve eating when not hungry and eating alone or secretly,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes people might have a particular or favorite type of food to binge. Binges can often be distressing and involve eating a larger amount of food that the person wanted to eat.\u201d\n\nHow is binge eating disorder diagnosed?\n\n\u201cBinge eating disorder is one of the most common eating disorders,\u201d says Woodward. \u201cBoth men and women can get it, but it typically starts in teenage years or when someone is in their 20s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that binge eating disorder affects everyone differently; behaviors will not be the same and they fall within a spectrum. This could be infrequent emotional overeating, which would be classed as \u2018eating behavior\u2019, to frequent, distressing and compulsive binge eating, which can be classed as an eating disorder. The GP or medical doctor will be the first step in helping assess the severity and next step of support. This may include a referral to psychiatry for a psychiatric assessment. This will involve being asked about your eating habits and how you\u2019re feeling, leading to potential diagnosis and support.\u201d\n\nWhat are the risks of binge eating disorder?\n\nA review in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences (opens in new tab) indicates that while binge eating disorder often occurs in non-obese individuals, it is often associated with weight gain over time and a higher risk of diabetes . As disordered eating habits are often tightly woven with negative body image, weight management in those with binge eating disorder is particularly difficult, and treating the underlying psychological condition is more important than enforced weight loss.\n\nWoodward says that binge eating disorder often goes hand-in-hand with other mental health conditions. \u201cIf people have binge eating disorder, they may have other mental health issues, such as depression , anxiety and low self-worth,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cBinge eating disorder may contribute to the worsening of these symptoms. People may feel trapped in a cycle of feeling distressed and compulsive binge eating, which could mean they feel more depressed or have lower self-esteem. It can often, but not always, cause weight gain and there are a number of related health risks associated with this \u2014 high blood pressure, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, for example.\u201d\n\nA review in the Nutrients (opens in new tab) journal also indicates that maladaptive emotion regulation plays a significant role in the development of binge eating disorders. Those who experience symptoms of binge eating disorder tend to suppress their emotions, and eating disorders have been linked to other forms of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, such as substance abuse and self-harm.\n\nWhat are the treatment options for binge eating disorder?\n\nA review in the Annals of Internal Medicine (opens in new tab) supports cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as an effective treatment for those with binge eating disorder and also indicates the usefulness of medications, such as lisdexamfetamine, SGAs, and topiramate to help reduce binge eating. A combination of medication and therapy is often the most effective approach, but therapy on its own is also a powerful tool in treating binge eating disorder.\n\nLauren Salvatore, a doctor of psychology and the clinical director of the Eating Disorders Day Treatment Program at Cohen Children\u2019s Medical Center, says that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) are the best treatment options available.\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThe best treatment options are CBT, which helps you change your thoughts and behaviors around binges, or DBT, which can treat the underlying emotion dysregulation that can lead to binges,\u201d she says. \u201cThese therapies can be delivered individually or in a group format by licensed mental health professionals. Most importantly though is finding a provider who you trust and who makes you feel comfortable.\u201d\n\nWoodward says that you may need to go to your doctor for diagnosis before attempting therapy. \u201cStart with booking an appointment with the GP. It can be hard to take this first step, as sometimes people might struggle to admit they are finding things difficult,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cSome people find it helpful to bring a friend or family member to the appointment for additional support. When it comes to specific treatment options, some people might prefer to explore guided self-help programmes: this will include working through self-help books alongside sessions with a therapist. For others, CBT might be the best option. This can take place one-to-one or in a group session. This will involve talking to a therapist about patterns of thoughts, feelings and behaviors which might be leading to your binge eating disorder. This also could involve discussions about triggers, meal planning and changing negative thoughts \u2013 as well as building new habits,\u201d he says.\n\nSupport for binge eating disorder\n\nSalvatore recommends the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) for specialist, judgment-free support. \u201cThere, you can find resources on treatment, providers and how to know when to seek help,\u201d she says.\n\nThe NEDA also has a helpline for those in acute crisis, or you can text if you prefer.. It has a quick screening tool available for those concerned about themselves or a loved one to see if it\u2019s time to seek professional help. The National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders (opens in new tab) (ANAD) also has a daytime helpline and can set you up with an eating disorder support group, or mentor, to help you to take steps towards recovery.\n\nThis article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.",
        "Explorers abseiled, squeezed and crawled their way through Australia's deepest cave system on July 30, boldly going where no cavers had gone before and setting a new cave depth record.\n\nCavers from the Southern Tasmanian Caverneers, a speleological organization based in Hobart, Australia, made it through the 1,316-foot-deep (401 meters) cave in Tasmania, an island south of mainland Australia. Stephen Fordyce, who first discovered the cave and organized the expedition, named the cave \"Delta Variant\" after the delta variant of COVID-19 to remind future cavers of current events, according to a statement released by Southern Tasmanian Caverneers.\n\nThe team spent 14 hours underground, navigating a subterranean system that included a 535-foot-tall (163 m) waterfall. Exploring \"the cave was exceptionally strenuous,\" caver Ben Armstrong, who was part of the exploration, said in the statement. \"It was extremely vertical, requiring hundreds of metres to be ascended and descended on ropes.\"\n\nThe bottom of the Delta Variant cave links up with a previously explored system called the Niggly-Growling Swallet cave system. However, the Delta Variant cave entrance is about 13 feet (4 m) higher up on the surface than the previously highest known entrance that connects to that system, so the team's new cave route set a record for the highest entrance to the lowest point, according to the statement.\n\nWhile the explorers established a new record for Australia, the deepest known cave in the world is still Veryovkina Cave in Abkhazia, an autonomous republic in northwestern Georgia in the Caucasus, with a depth of 7,257 feet (2,212 m), according to Guinness World Records (opens in new tab).\n\nRelated: Cavers discover snakes and waterfalls inside Yemen's infamous 'Well of Hell' in world-first descent\n\nThe explorers in Tasmania used lasers and dye-tracing techniques in the cave system to learn the Delta Variant cave's position and how it connects to the Niggly-Growling Swallet system. They explored the cave in stages over a period of 6 months, fixing ropes as they went.\n\n\"It\u2019s been like climbing a mountain in reverse,\" Southern Tasmanian Caverneers team member Karina Anders said in the statement. \"Each trip we have taken as much rope as we can carry, then descended down while exploring side passages, then we go back up. The next trip we bring more rope and go a bit further.\"\n\nOn the day the team completed their passage, they navigated down their existing ropes to the lowest explored point, and then secured one more rope to descend 115 feet (35 m) down a final shaft that connected Delta Variant cave to the Niggly-Growling Swallet system. After celebrating in party hats, the team returned to the surface via the Niggly-Growling Swallet system, exiting mere feet from the Delta Variant cave entrance.\n\n\"Cavers have been so close for decades!\" team member Brendan Moore said in the statement. \"However, it is up a short, steep cliff, which no one had ever thought to climb. The actual entrance is hidden by thick scrub and fallen logs. It just shows you what the Tasmanian bush can hide.\"\n\nOriginally published on Live Science.",
        "Paris, the capital of France, is awash with history; it's home to the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Notre-Dame Cathedral and the Louvre , the world's most-visited museum (opens in new tab).\n\nYet, despite the city's wealth of cultural hotspots, architectural delights and superb restaurants (it currently has over 90 Michelin one-star (opens in new tab) eateries) some tourists find themselves unable to enjoy a trip to Paris. A small percentage of those who venture to The City of Light experience \"Paris syndrome,\" a psychological condition with symptoms including nausea, vomiting, hallucinations and increased heart rate.\n\nBut what, exactly, is Paris syndrome? Who tends to be affected by it, and why?\n\nThough not indexed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Paris syndrome is recognized by many experts as a real, though rare, phenomenon. According to Mathieu Deflem, a professor of sociology at the University of South Carolina, Paris syndrome is \"most common among Japanese\" tourists. Why, then, are Japanese people so susceptible?\n\n\"We are talking about a culture that, historically, had a completely different belief system and development trajectory from places in Europe,\" Rodanthi Tzanelli, a professor of cultural sociology at the University of Leeds in the U.K., told Live Science. These cultural differences, as well as likely unmet romantic expectations, may explain why Japanese visitors are at an elevated risk for Paris syndrome.\n\nRelated: Did Marie Antoinette really say 'Let them eat cake'?\n\nNausea, vomiting, hallucinations and increased heart rate are all symptoms of Paris syndrome. (Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nParis syndrome should be regarded as an extreme form of culture shock, Deflem said. Culture shock can, in particularly severe cases, result in people feeling disorientated, depressed, irritable and physically ill, according to the University of the Pacific in California (opens in new tab).\n\n\n\n\"Culture shock is an illness resulting from the loss of meaning brought about when people from one symbolic reality find themselves immersed in another,\" Rachel Irwin, now a cultural sciences researcher at Lund University in Sweden, wrote in a 2007 article (opens in new tab). In other words, people can become bewildered \u2014 sometimes to a significant degree \u2014 when surrounded by symbols (logos, names, signs, brands) that are different from those they would usually encounter.\n\n\n\nThe symptoms associated with culture shock are similar to those experienced by someone who is feeling anxious. According to Calm Clinic (opens in new tab), a mental health resource website, when someone is experiencing anxiety, signals will be sent to the stomach that are \"related to the fight or flight response.\" As a result, the \"signals alter the way that the stomach and gut process and digest food, causing nausea.\" In particularly extreme cases of anxiety \u2014 as with culture shock \u2014 this nausea can lead to vomiting, disorientation and a host of other physical reactions.\n\n\n\nWhile everybody experiences culture shock \"in one form or another when visiting somewhere new,\" some people feel it in more pronounced and visceral ways when presented with a culture that is \"unexpected or nuanced,\" according to Deflem.\n\nWith regard to Paris syndrome specifically, \"a number of factors are at work,\" Deflem told Live Science. \"It will be a combination of expectations from Japanese culture and the reality of Paris.\"\n\nDeflem noted that, generally speaking, Japanese culture has a somewhat romanticized view of the West, \"especially Europe.\" This, Deflem suggests, is largely down to how Paris is represented in films \u2014 such as \"Am\u00e9lie\" (Miramax Films, 2001), \"Before Sunset\" (Warner Independent Pictures, 2004) and \"An American in Paris\" (Loew's Inc., 1954) \u2014 and books \u2014 \"A Night at the Majestic\" (Faber and Faber, 2006), \"The Ladies' Delight\" (1883) and \"A Moveable Feast\" (Scribner Classic, 1964) \u2014 which tend to focus on art, coffee culture, quaint restaurants and cordial, intelligent conversation. He suggested that these expectations are \"not realistic, especially in Paris, which is not known for being hospitable.\"\n\nIndeed, a 2014 study carried out by Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler (opens in new tab) named Paris the world's fourth most unfriendly city; a 2020 study by CEOWORLD magazine (opens in new tab) awarded Paris the title of rudest city in Europe; and a 2021 survey by InterNations (opens in new tab), an organization dedicated to helping people relocate, concluded that Paris is Europe's third-least-friendly city for expats.\n\nRelated: How did bachelor and bachelorette parties get started?\n\nReality hits hard when visitors to Paris are forced to take off the rose-tinted glasses of which they've been viewing the city of romance. (Image credit: by-studio via Getty Images)\n\nIn popular culture, \"Paris is presented in ways that do not reflect the realities of the city, especially not in recent times, when much of Paris is no longer the France of old,\" Deflem said.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Deflem highlighted that \"Japan, for example, has a very orderly and polite culture,\" while Parisian everyday life is less so \"despite its image,\" he said. \"Parisians can sometimes be guilty of looking down on people \u2014 even non-Parisian French \u2014 which is seldom seen in Japanese culture. The confrontation is sharp.\"\n\nAccording to Deflem, \"very subtle differences\" regarding cultural norms or societal expectations can cause confusion because \"it makes situations tricky to navigate.\" Such misunderstandings can be difficult for tourists because it is hard to know when a \"particular value is at play, when to apologize, when not to ask a question etc. Culture is complex.\"\n\nBut could visitors to other cities experience similar feelings? Might someone exhibit symptoms similar to those associated with Paris syndrome in other historic cities, such as Vienna, New York or Beijing?\n\nTzanelli thinks Paris syndrome may not be specific to the French capital. Rather, she regards it as \"a very complex psychic phenomenon that has to do with disappointment, even despair, about the ways reality does not match our romantic expectations.\"\n\nThe syndrome is likely a \"generational phenomenon,\" because younger generations tend to be \"more globetrotting,\" and therefore are likely to be more prepared for what they will experience at a destination, she added.\n\nHowever, Tzanelli is keen to point out that nobody is immune to culture shock, regardless of their age or the amount they have traveled.\n\n\"We are creatures of habit,\" she said. \"We are inculcated into a particular way of life, adopt behaviors and habits from our surroundings, and become part of a culture and social group. We never think about these things, but habits, behaviors and values always work at the back of who we are and what we do. When we are suddenly taken out of this system of beliefs and habits, out of the ways we structure our life, we are left with no means to frame and define who we are.\"\n\nTzanelli noted that, although she's well acquainted with culture shock and has studied it in detail, she is by no means immune to its effects.\n\n\"I've had this experience [of culture shock] even in places I had previously visited,\" she said. \"Time affects memory, and the stored images we have of places are bound to differ from reality.\"\n\nOriginally published on Live Science.",

        "The findings of a recent Phase IIa clinical trial suggest that OP-101, a hydroxyl-polyamidoamine dendrimer\u2013N-acetyl cysteine conjugate, may have potential for treating systemic hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19.\n\nA single intravenous infusion of the anti-inflammatory compound was well tolerated and reduced the risk of death or mechanical ventilation at 30 and 60 days after treatment when compared to placebo. OP-101 treatment, which targets activated macrophages, was associated with decreased serum concentrations of proinflammatory markers as well as markers of neurological injury (neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein). The drug may have the potential to treat systemic inflammation and brain injury in patients with severe COVID-19 and significantly reduce their chances of death.\n\nThe results of the trial were published in Science Translational Medicine in the article, \u201cDendrimer nanotherapy for severe COVID-19 attenuates inflammation and neurological injury markers and improves outcomes in a Phase IIa clinical trial.\u201d\n\nIn the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, adaptive Phase IIa trial, 24 patients classified as having severe COVID-19 across five clinical sites in the United States were randomized to receive a single intravenous dose of placebo (n = 7 patients) or OP-101 at 2 (n = 6), 4 (n = 6), or 8 mg/kg (n = 5 patients).

Gusdon, MD, assistant professor in the Vivian L. Smith department of neurosurgery with McGovern Medical School at UTHealth Houston. \u201cDue to its excellent safety profile, we were excited to offer this therapy to these critically ill patients at Memorial Hermann Hospital.\u201d\n\nHyperinflammation triggered by SARS-CoV-2 is a major cause of disease severity in COVID-19. OP-101 was found to be better than a placebo at decreasing inflammatory markers, as well as better at reducing markers of neurological injury, including neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein.\n\nAdditionally, risk for the composite outcome of mechanical ventilation or death at 30 or 60 days after treatment was 71% for patients receiving the placebo, but just 18% for patients in the pooled OP-101 treatment arms. At 60 days after treatment, 3 of 7 patients given placebo and 14 of 17 patients treated with OP-101 survived.\n\nThe data shows that OP-101 was well tolerated in the critically ill patient population and could serve as an effective treatment for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.\n\n\u201cAlthough this was a small-dose escalation trial, there was clearly a strong signal toward benefit at both acute and chronic timepoint,\u201d Gusdon said. \u201cThe possibility that this therapy could also benefit patients with other diseases that lead to systemic inflammatory responses, including various forms of brain injury, is extremely exciting.\u201d",

        "A pan-coronavirus vaccine\u2014one that provides protection against a number of different coronaviruses\u2014is public health\u2019s holy grail. To be effective, the vaccine would need to trigger antibodies that recognize and neutralize a range of coronaviruses, stopping the virus from entering hosts cells and replicating. This type of vaccine is a challenge to develop for coronaviruses, in part, because they frequently mutate and generally induce incomplete protection against reinfection.\n\nAlthough antibody cross-reactivity with the Spike proteins of different coronaviruses, including the common cold coronaviruses (HCoVs), has been shown, the authors of a new paper noted that it is unclear \u201cwhether such antibody responses, typically targeting the conserved S2 subunit, contribute to protection when induced by infection or through vaccination.\u201d\n\nNow, researchers have investigated whether antibodies that target the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2\u2019s spike protein also neutralize other coronaviruses. This specific area of the spike protein tethers it to the virus membrane and allows the virus to fuse with the membrane of a host cell.\n\nThe researchers said their findings \u201cestablish the protective value of an S2-targeting vaccine and support the notion that S2 vaccination may better prepare the immune system to respond to the changing nature of the S1 subunit in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, as well as to future coronavirus zoonoses.\u201d\n\nThe study titled, \u201cSARS-CoV-2 S2-targeted vaccination elicits broadly neutralizing antibodies,\u201d is published in Science Translational Medicine.\n\n\u201cThe expectation for a vaccine that targets the S2 area is that it could offer some protection against all current, as well as future, coronaviruses,\u201d noted George Kassiotis, PhD, principal group leader at the Francis Crick Institute. \u201cThis differs from vaccines that target the more variable S1 area which, while effective against the matching variant they are designed against, are less able to target other variants or a broad range of coronaviruses.\u201d\n\nThe S2 area of the spike protein has, until recently, been overlooked as providing a basis for vaccination. This is because certain critical targets in the S2 area are only revealed after the virus has bound to a cell, a process mediated by the S1 area. As a result, there may be a narrower window of opportunity for S2 antibodies to neutralize the virus than for antibodies that target the S1 area.\n\nUsing a mouse model, the team found that prior HCoV-OC43 S\u2013targeted immunity \u201cprimes neutralizing antibody responses to otherwise subimmunogenic SARS-CoV-2 S exposure and promotes S2-targeting antibody responses.\u201d\n\nAfter vaccinating mice with SARS-CoV-2 S2, the mice created antibodies that were able to neutralize a number of other animal and human coronaviruses, including: the seasonal \u201ccommon cold\u201d coronavirus HCoV-OC43, the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, the D614G mutant that dominated in the first wave, Alpha, Beta, Delta, the original Omicron, and two bat coronaviruses.\n\n\u201cThe S2 area of the spike protein is a promising target for a potential pan-coronavirus vaccine because this area is much more similar across different coronaviruses than the S1 area,\u201d noted Kevin Ng, a PhD student in the retrovirus laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute. \u201cIt is less subject to mutations, and so a vaccine targeted at this area should be more robust.\u201d\n\nLastly, in mice with a history of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan\u2013based S vaccination, further S2 vaccination induced broader neutralizing antibody response than booster Wuhan S vaccination, suggesting that \u201cit may prevent repertoire focusing caused by repeated homologous vaccination.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile a potential S2 vaccine would not stop people being infected, the idea is it would prime their immune system to respond to a future coronavirus infection,\u201d added Nikhil Faulkner, a PhD student in the retroviral immunology laboratory at the Crick. \u201cThis would hopefully provide enough protection to survive an initial infection during which they could develop further immunity specific to that particular virus.\u201d\n\nThe researchers will continue this work studying the potential of a pan-coronavirus that targets the S2 area of the spike protein and how it could be integrated with currently licensed vaccines.",
        "A research team reports discovering a neutralizing monoclonal antibody that it says has the potential to become a universal coronavirus therapy against SARS-CoV-2 and all its variants of concern, including Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon and Omicron.\n\nIn multiple animal models, the mAb shows effectiveness against the SARS-CoV, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome that emerged in China in 2002, and MERS-CoV, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome that appeared in Saudi Arabia in 2012, according to the scientists, who had that it also shows effectiveness against several common cold coronaviruses.\n\nThe mAb targets the S2 stalk region of the viral spike (S) protein that is highly conserved among beta-coronaviruses yet is also essential for the virus to attach and enter cells, leading to infection. The mAb protected against infections when given as an intraperitoneal injection or a nasal dose.\n\nThe study \u201cPotent universal beta-coronavirus therapeutic activity mediated by direct respiratory administration of a Spike S2 domain-specific human neutralizing monoclonal antibody\u201d appears in PLOS Pathogens.\n\n\u201cSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) marks the third novel \u03b2-coronavirus to cause significant human mortality in the last two decades. Although vaccines are available, too few have been administered worldwide to keep the virus in check and to prevent mutations leading to immune escape. To determine if antibodies could be identified with universal coronavirus activity, plasma from convalescent subjects was screened for IgG against a stabilized pre-fusion SARS-CoV-2 spike S2 domain, which is highly conserved between human \u03b2-coronavirus,\u201d write the investigators.\n\nHuman monoclonal antibodies developed\n\n\u201cFrom these subjects, several S2-specific human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) were developed that neutralized SARS-CoV-2 with recognition of all variants of concern (VoC) tested (Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, and Omicron). The hmAb 1249A8 emerged as the most potent and broad hmAb, able to recognize all human \u03b2-coronavirus and neutralize SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 1249A8 demonstrated significant prophylactic activity in K18 hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 lineage A and lineage B Beta, and Omicron VoC. 1249A8 delivered as a single 4 mg/kg intranasal (i.n.) dose to hamsters 12 hours following infection with SARS-CoV-2 Delta protected them from weight loss, with therapeutic activity further enhanced when combined with 1213H7, an S1-specific neutralizing hmAb. As little as 2 mg/kg of 1249A8 i.n. dose 12 hours following infection with SARS-CoV Urbani strain, protected hamsters from weight loss and significantly reduced upper and lower respiratory viral burden.\n\n\u201cThese results indicate in vivo cooperativity between S1 and S2 specific neutralizing hmAbs and that potent universal coronavirus neutralizing mAbs with therapeutic potential can be induced in humans and can guide universal coronavirus vaccine development.\u201d\n\nThe mAb, and mAb discovered earlier by the researchers, are being developed as a therapeutic cocktail for COVID-19 under license to Aridis Pharmaceuticals.\n\n\u201cSARS-CoV-2 marks the third time in the last two decades a beta-coronavirus has caused significant mortality in humans,\u201d says James J. Kobie, PhD, co-senior study author from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. \u201cSARS-CoV-2 has caused the most infections and deaths worldwide. New variants pose the risk of evading the immune system, even in vaccinated and previously infected individuals, and there remains the potential for other genetically distinct coronaviruses to emerge as new pandemic strains in the future.\n\n\u201cFor these reasons, finding new therapeutic and prophylactic drugs and vaccine strategies that have universal activity against the coronavirus is essential for protecting humanity against the current and future beta-coronavirus outbreaks or pandemics.\u201d\n\nVaccines and other monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 have focused on the receptor-binding domain, or the RBD, located at the heads of the S viral protein spike that projects from the surface of the virus. Each virus has 24 to 40 spikes. The RBD is good at eliciting an immune response, but that portion of the S permits many mutations that can let the virus escape antibodies.\n\nOne key in the present research was finding an antibody target on a part of the spike called the S2, or the stalk region. This region is highly conserved and only rarely mutates because that would disrupt its essential function. After the RBD at the head of the S attaches the coronavirus to a receptor molecule on the surface of a target cell, the S2 stalk acts to bring the virus inside the target cell. There the virus replicates, killing the cell, and releasing a hoard of new, infectious virions.\n\nAridis is using the two hmAbs in its AR-701 cocktail designed for inhaled delivery. AR-701 is engineered for long-acting effectiveness, potentially lasting a year or more when used in humans, according to the company.\n\nAlso involved in the study are researchers from the Texas Biomedical Research Institute and Colorado State University."

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children\u2019s Hospital Association are collaborating to collect and share all publicly available data from states on child COVID-19 cases. The definition of \u201cchild\u201d case is based on varying age ranges reported across states (see report Appendix for details and links to all data sources).\n\nFor the week ending August 4th, almost 97,000 child COVID-19 cases were reported, the fourth consecutive weekly increase of reported cases, with around 68,000 cases reported the week ending July 7th. Reported COVID-19 cases among children spiked dramatically in 2022 during the Omicron variant winter surge, peaking at 1,150,000 cases reported in one week. Cases have decreased substantially since the Omicron peak and are similar to what they were one year ago, August 5, 2021, when 94,000 child cases were reported.\n\nNearly 14.2 million children are reported to have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic according to available state reports; over 359,000 of these cases have been added in the past 4 weeks. Approximately 6.3 million reported cases have been added in 2022.\n\nThe age distribution of reported COVID-19 cases was provided on the health department websites of reporting states, New York City, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam.\n\nSince the pandemic began, children represented 18.5% of total cumulated cases.\n\nSince early June, there has been a notable decline in the portion of reported weekly COVID-19 cases that are children. For the week ending August 4th, this portion was 13.4% (children, under age 18, make up 22.2% of the US population). While COVID-19 cases are likely increasingly under-reported for all age groups, this decline indicates that children are disproportionately undercounted in reported COVID-19 cases.\n\nThere is an urgent need to collect more age-specific data to assess the severity of illness related to new variants as well as potential longer-term effects. It is important to recognize there are immediate effects of the pandemic on children\u2019s health, but importantly we need to identify and address the long-lasting impacts on the physical, mental, and social well-being of this generation of children and youth.\n\n\n\n",
        "Summary: Study questions whether smell loss associated with COVID-19 infection may increase the risk of developing dementia later in life.\n\nSource: APS\n\nA review of studies about the effect of SARS-CoV-2\u2014the virus that causes COVID-19\u2014on the olfactory system introduces questions about whether loss of smell associated with COVID-19 infection may increase the risk of developing dementia later in life.\n\nThe review is published ahead of print in the Journal of Neurophysiology (JNP).\n\nLoss of smell (anosmia) is one of the hallmark symptoms associated with the first wave of COVID-19 in 2020, with an estimated 77-85% of people infected with the virus reporting loss or alteration of smell (parosmia).\n\nAlthough most people recover quickly from this dysfunction, an estimated 15 million people around the world are considered \u201csmell long haulers\u201d after otherwise recovering from COVID-19. They experience persistent anosmia or parosmia.\n\nStudies have shown that the olfactory sensory epithelium\u2014located in the upper area of the nose, close to where the olfactory nerve enters the olfactory bulb in the brain\u2014carries a high viral load in people infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe olfactory bulb is the structure in the brain that manages the sense of smell and sends sensory information to other areas of the brain for processing. These other brain regions are involved with learning, memory and emotion.\n\n\u201cAll of this means that the [olfactory bulb] is involved in much more than smelling. It\u2019s involved in the sense of place, memory, context, emotion, reward and many other processes,\u201d said Leslie M. Kay, Ph.D., author of the review.\n\nDue to the proximity of the olfactory sensory epithelium to the olfactory bulb, COVID-19 infection could affect cognitive function even after recovery. A correlation between disrupted sense of smell and dementia has also been found in some people with neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease. Animal studies have shown that damage to the bulb results in anxiety and a depression-like state.\n\nAlthough most people recover quickly from this dysfunction, an estimated 15 million people around the world are considered \u201csmell long haulers\u201d after otherwise recovering from COVID-19. They experience persistent anosmia or parosmia. Image is in the public domain\n\n\u201cPrevious pandemics also lend support to the theory that \u201cviral invasion of the [central nervous system] can be a trigger for neurodegeneration resulting in later neurological deficit,\u201d Kay explained. The 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic led to a wave of people who developed Parkinson\u2019s disease, and data from Denmark find that people who have had the flu have a 70% higher risk of developing Parkinson\u2019s disease a decade later.\n\n\u201cThe review offers evidence that suggests inflammation introduced to the olfactory nerve and damage to the olfactory bulb via COVID-19 infection and immune response may also cause degeneration of brain structures connected to the olfactory system and cognitive impairment.\n\nMore research is needed and is possible due to the technological advances available to scientists during the current pandemic,\u201d Kay said.\n\n\u201cWhile a catastrophe on many levels, the COVID-19 pandemic presents an opportunity to improve human health.\u201d\n\nAbout this COVID-19 and dementia research news\n\nAuthor: Press Office\n\nSource: APS\n\nContact: Press Office \u2013 APS\n\nImage: The image is in the public domain\n\nOriginal Research: Open access.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 and olfactory dysfunction: a looming wave of dementia?\u201d by Leslie M. Kay et al. Journal of Neurophysiology\n\nAbstract\n\nCOVID-19 and olfactory dysfunction: a looming wave of dementia?\n\nOlfactory dysfunction is a hallmark symptom of COVID-19 disease resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nThe cause of the sudden and usually temporary anosmia that most people suffer from COVID-19 is likely entirely peripheral \u2013 inflammation and other damage caused by the virus in the sensory epithelium inside the upper recesses of the nasal cavity can damage or prevent chemicals from properly activating the olfactory sensory neurons.\n\nHowever, persistent olfactory dysfunction from COVID-19, in the form of hyposmia and parosmia (decreased or altered smell) may affect as many as 15 million people worldwide.\n\nThis epidemic of olfactory dysfunction is thus a continuing public health concern. Mounting evidence suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself or inflammation from the immune response in the nasal sensory epithelium may invade the olfactory bulb, likely via non-neuronal transmission. COVID-19 related long term olfactory dysfunction and early damage to olfactory and limbic brain regions suggests a pattern of degeneration similar to that seen in early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and Lewy Body dementias.\n\nThus, long term olfactory dysfunction coupled with cognitive and emotional disturbance from COVID-19 may be the first signs of delayed onset dementia from neurodegeneration.\n\nFew treatments are known to be effective to prevent further degeneration, but the first line of defense against degeneration may be olfactory and environmental enrichment.\n\nThere is a pressing need for more research on treatments for olfactory dysfunction and longitudinal studies including cognitive and olfactory function from patients who have recovered from even mild COVID-19.",
        "Summary: The effects of COVID-19 infection on neurological health are becoming more apparent. A new study reveals COVID-19 can predispose people to irreversible neurological conditions, accelerate brain aging, and increase the risk of stroke and brain bleeds.\n\nSource: Houston Methodist\n\nA new study by Houston Methodist researchers reviews the emerging insights and evidence that suggest COVID-19 infections may have both short- and long-term neurological effects.\n\nMajor findings include that COVID-19 infections may predispose individuals to developing irreversible neurological conditions, may increase the likelihood of strokes and may increase the chance of developing persistent brain lesions that can lead to brain bleeding.\n\nLed by corresponding authors Joy Mitra, Ph.D., Instructor, and Muralidhar L. Hegde, Ph.D., Professor of Neurosurgery, with the Division of DNA Repair within the Center for Neuroregeneration at the Houston Methodist Research Institute, the research team described their findings in an article titled \u201cSARS-CoV-2 and the Central Nervous System: Emerging Insights into Hemorrhage-Associated Neurological Consequences and Therapeutic Considerations\u201d in the journal Ageing Research Reviews.\n\nStill a major burden on our daily lives, a great deal of research has shown that the impacts of the disease go far beyond the actual time of infection. Since the onset of the pandemic, COVID-19 has surpassed a death toll of more than 5.49 million worldwide and more than 307 million confirmed positive cases, with the U.S. accounting for almost 90 million of those cases, according to the Our World in Data website.\n\nCOVID-19 is known to invade and infect the brain, among other major organs. While a lot of research has been done to help us understand the evolution, infection and pathology of the disease, there is still a great deal that remains unclear about the long-term effects, especially on the brain.\n\nThe coronavirus infection can cause long-term and irreversible neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in the elderly and other vulnerable populations. Several brain imaging studies on COVID-19 victims and survivors have confirmed the formation of microbleed lesions in deeper brain regions related to our cognitive and memory functions.\n\nIn this review study, researchers have critically evaluated the possible chronic neuropathological outcomes in aging and comorbid populations if timely therapeutic intervention is not implemented.\n\nMicrobleeds are emerging neuropathological signatures frequently identified in people suffering from chronic stress, depressive disorders, diabetes and age-associated comorbidities. Based on their earlier findings, the investigators discuss how COVID-19-induced microhemorrhagic lesions may exacerbate DNA damage in affected brain cells, resulting in neuronal senescence and activation of cell death mechanisms, which ultimately impact brain microstructure-vasculature.\n\nThese pathological phenomena resemble hallmarks of neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases and are likely to aggravate advanced-stage dementia, as well as cognitive and motor deficits.\n\nStill a major burden on our daily lives, a great deal of research has shown that the impacts of the disease go far beyond the actual time of infection. Image is in the public domain\n\nThe effects of COVID-19 infection on various aspects of the central nervous system are currently being studied. For instance, 20-30% of COVID-19 patients report a lingering psychological condition known as \u201cbrain fog\u201d where individuals suffer from symptoms such as memory loss, difficulty in concentrating, forgetting daily activities, difficulty in selecting the right words, taking longer than usual time to complete a regular task, disoriented thought processes and emotional numbness.\n\nMore severe long-term effects analyzed in the Houston Methodist review article include predispositions for Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and related neurodegenerative diseases, as well as cardiovascular disorders due to internal bleeding and blood clotting-induced lesions in the part of the brain that regulates our respiratory system, following the COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nAdditionally, cellular aging is thought to be accelerated in COVID-19 patients. A plethora of cellular stresses inhibit the virus-infected cells from undergoing their normal biological functions and let them enter into \u201chibernation mode\u201d or even die completely.\n\nThe study also suggests various strategies to improve some of these long-term neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative outcomes, as well as outlines the importance of the therapeutic regimen of the \u201cnanozyme\u201d in combination with various FDA-approved drugs that may prove successful to fight against this catastrophic disease.\n\nHowever, given the ever-evolving nature of this field, associations like the ones described in this review show the fight against COVID-19 is far from over, say the investigators, and reinforce the message that getting vaccinated and maintaining proper hygiene are key in trying to prevent such long-term and detrimental consequences.\n\nAbout this COVID-19 and neurology research news\n\nAuthor: Press Office\n\nSource: Houston Methodist\n\nContact: Press Office \u2013 Houston Methodist\n\nImage: The image is in the public domain\n\nOriginal Research: Open access.\n\n\u201cSARS-CoV-2 and the central nervous system: Emerging insights into hemorrhage-associated neurological consequences and therapeutic considerations\u201d by Joy Mitra et al. Ageing Research Reviews\n\nAbstract\n\nSARS-CoV-2 and the central nervous system: Emerging insights into hemorrhage-associated neurological consequences and therapeutic considerations\n\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to impact our lives by causing widespread illness and death and poses a threat due to the possibility of emerging strains. SARS-CoV-2 targets angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) before entering vital organs of the body, including the brain. Studies have shown systemic inflammation, cellular senescence, and viral toxicity-mediated multi-organ failure occur during infectious periods.\n\nHowever, prognostic investigations suggest that both acute and long-term neurological complications, including predisposition to irreversible neurodegenerative diseases, can be a serious concern for COVID-19 survivors, especially the elderly population.\n\nAs emerging studies reveal sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different parts of the brain, potential causes of chronic lesions including cerebral and deep-brain microbleeds and the likelihood of developing stroke-like pathologies increases, with critical long-term consequences, particularly for individuals with neuropathological and/or age-associated comorbid conditions.\n\nOur recent studies linking the blood degradation products to genome instability, leading to cellular senescence and ferroptosis, raise the possibility of similar neurovascular events as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nIn this review, we discuss the neuropathological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID survivors, focusing on possible hemorrhagic damage in brain cells, its association to aging, and the future directions in developing mechanism-guided therapeutic strategies.",

        "Share on Pinterest An animal study suggests that the COVID-19 oral antiviral pill molnupiravir may work better in males. Ziad Ahmed/NurPhoto via Getty Images Molnupiravir, an oral antiviral pill authorized to treat COVID-19, has been available in the United States and other countries since December 2021.\n\nAntivirals can reduce the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduce fatalities among people who are vulnerable to more severe COVID-19.\n\nNew animal research suggests that molnupiravir might work better for the male sex with Omicron infections.\n\nExperts say animal models can be used to test the drug\u2019s effectiveness on different variants, including Omicron, in preclinical trials. While COVID-19 vaccines have been crucial in helping reduce the number of fatalities caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections, antivirals also played a part. One of those drugs is molnupiravir, which the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) authorized for use in people over the age of 1 in December 2021. It has been a particularly useful drug as it can be taken orally and at home in a bid to avoid hospitalization. Research published in October 2021 in the BMJ showed that molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization by 50% in people at higher risk of severe COVID-19. A multi-center group of investigators headed by a team at Georgia State University investigated the effect of molnupiravir on different SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron, on human cells, human cell-derived organoids, ferrets, and dwarf hamsters, with some mixed results. Researchers published the results in Nature Communications .\n\nMolnupiravir for COVID-19 When the drug was initially approved, the FDA noted that new variants of concern meant it was important to expand the number of therapies available while continuing to test their safety and effectiveness. Researchers had well-documented the immune evasion capabilities of new SARS-CoV-2 variants\u2014whether it was immunity gained via vaccination or previous infection. However, it is unclear how variants impact the effectiveness of antiviral drug treatments such as molnupiravir. As molnupiravir works by inhibiting an enzyme involved in the viral life cycle in infected cells, studies of its efficacy need to be in the host cells rather than directly on the virus itself, said Dr. Hella Kohlhof, Chief Scientific Officer at Immunic Therapeutics. This host-based approach, such as designing drugs that could have an antiviral effect in the host cell rather than on the virus, could help develop treatments against future variations. Dr. Kohlhof told Medical News Today in an interview that molnupiravir is a relatively broad-based antiviral means that its efficacy should not\u2014in theory\u2014vary between different variants as much as vaccines, which were designed solely to target the spike protein. \u201cVaccination, to be really efficacious, needs to be as specific as possible on certain proteins from the virus. And if you do the antiviral drug development, and if you have this host-based approach, you\u2019re really acting on a mechanism within the infected cell and not on the virus directly,\u201d Dr. Kohlhof explained. It isn\u2019t easy to hold clinical trials for each new variant as these take months. In addition, a new variant may become dominant when the results are published. That\u2019s why it has spurred scientists to develop other models, such as human cells or animals, to test the effect of these antiviral therapies for COVID-19. The World Health Organization , for example, assembled its own COVID-19 modeling expert group in 2020. The group evaluates advances in animal models used as preclinical models. So far, experts have proposed non-human primates, mice, ferrets, and hamsters as potentially useful models. Dr. Simon Funnell, a scientific leader of the U.K. Health Security Agency and a member of the WHO expert group for the past two years, told MNT that one of the outcomes of this work was to highlight the importance of reproducing such findings in more than one species. \u201cExperience has shown, especially during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, that there is great strength in data sharing and verification by independent groups,\u201d Dr. Funnell said. He gave an example of how research around hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 progressed. \u201cThis was the case for the preclinical assessment of hydroxychloroquine where human organ culture findings were supported by non-human primate and other animal model data [that showed it was not an effective drug] despite early findings in Vero cells and mice which suggested it would a beneficial drug to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection,\u201d he explained.\n\nTesting molnupiravir in different models For their first experiment, the researchers looked at the drug\u2019s effect on human cells infected with different variants of concern. To do this, they looked at cells in vitro and developed organoids designed to behave like miniature organs made of tissues derived from human cell lines. As part of this experiment, the researchers developed organoids to mimic the epithelium of the lungs in humans, using cells from a male human donor. Their analysis found molnupiravir equally inhibited variants of concern in cells and organoids. They carried out further studies in ferrets, which showed that molnupiravir treatment reduced the shedding of the virus and prevented transmission.\n\nSex differences with Omicron However, one of the more surprising findings from the study was when male dwarf hamsters fared better overall than female hamsters when treated with molnupiravir after infection with Omicron. Researchers did not observe this variation with other variants, which matches previous trials on humans. The study did not investigate the impact of sex on the results in the other models as the only ferrets used were female and the cells used to develop organoids were male. Dr. Funnell said this could have been investigated further: \u201cFemale human donors are available for organoid culture and it seems that this could easily be investigated. The media used for such studies could also be balanced to reflect human hormonal differences in circulating blood.\u201d",

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines mental health as \u201ca state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.\u201d Mental health issues occur when people cannot cope well with the stresses of life.

Frontline workers, particularly medical professionals, have experienced burnout and chronic stress from the increased pressure. Multiple lockdowns, physical distancing, and fear of infection have increased isolation, loneliness, and anxiety, all factors that, according to Lee Chambers, psychologist and founder of Essentialise Workplace Wellbeing, are \u201cmassive catalysts\u201d for mental health issues. Other experts agree. According to Dr. Adrian James, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists: \u201cSocial isolation, loneliness, stress and anxiety, domestic abuse, bereavement, financial difficulties, unemployment and severe COVID-19 infection are all factors that might have caused people\u2019s mental health to deteriorate.\u201d\n\nWorldwide increases in mental health issues In 2019, a study in The Lancet reported that some 12.5% of the global population would have an issue with their mental health at some time in their life. In March 2022, the WHO reported that worldwide, anxiety and depression increased by 25% in the first year of the pandemic. Lee Chambers has seen evidence of this: \u201cIf I\u2019m honest, from my perspective, the incidence of everything [mental health-related] has increased. [\u2026] It has been amplified for people who are already suffering with certain conditions. They\u2019ve found less access to services and challenges in managing their everyday existence.\u201c He added: \u201cOne thing that continually got flagged was new incidences. People who had never previously identified as having any mental health condition had actually disclosed [\u2026] or, in surveys, said they were struggling significantly. That is interesting, as it shows the impact is reaching beyond those who were already impacted pre-[COVID-19].\u201d\n\nWho is most affected? An analysis of more than 200,000 people in northern Europe found that younger respondents and those with previously diagnosed mental illness reported poorer mental health during the first months of the pandemic. However, mental health issues are not confined to these groups. Sharon Greene, L.C.S.W., who specializes in treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents of Providence Saint John\u2019s Child & Family Development Center in Santa Monica, CA, told MNT of the pandemic\u2019s widespread impact: \u201cI actually feel everyone has been impacted across the board in different ways. Of course, frontline workers and health professionals were at the forefront and may have experienced more trauma. We are only starting to understand the mental health impacts of the pandemic.\u201d Young people may be less at risk to contract a SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they have not escaped the pandemic\u2019s effects. Disruption to education, work, and social interactions have all taken their toll. In August 2020, the International Labour Organization described the \u201cimpact of the pandemic on young people to be systematic, deep and disproportionate.\u201c Several studies have found that students have experienced higher levels of symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the pandemic. \u201cYounger people [\u2026] are more likely to fall into negative coping mechanisms because they don\u2019t have the experience and they live in a very digital world \u2014 that\u2019s a challenge for them. Dealing with uncertainty when you are at that adolescent-adult transition is hard enough when everything is bright and rosy.\u201d \u2013 Lee Chambers It is unsurprising, therefore, that a recent OECD report states that the \u201c[p]revalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression has risen dramatically among young people and remains higher than pre\u2011crisis levels.\u201d\n\nOn the frontline For medical professionals, the pressures have been intense. Not only have they faced continued exposure to SARS-CoV-2, but they have also had to cope with the demands of their changing roles during the pandemic, which has inevitably taken a toll on their mental health. A meta-analysis of studies into mental health effects of the pandemic on healthcare workers found that anxiety, depression, and stress were most prevalent among this cohort. Many healthcare workers also reported burnout, insomnia, fear of infection, and suicidal thoughts. It is not just those dealing with COVID-19 patients in a hospital setting who have been affected. A global review of studies published in the British Journal of General Practice found high levels of work-related stress, anxiety, and burnout among primary care doctors in many countries. Lee Chambers reported another issue among medical professionals: \u201cThere is a real feeling of\u2026 I suppose the term for it is \u2018moral injury,\u2019 a real feeling that you are putting yourself at risk of disease. You are on the front lines really making the best of a crisis and then you\u2019ve got certain people in positions of influence just doing as they please, having parties. [\u2026] That\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s really distressing a lot of medical professionals.\u201d The worrying impact of this is that many doctors may leave the profession. The British Medical Association found in a recent survey that 21% of respondents were considering leaving the NHS, and 25% were considering taking a career break because of the stress of working through the pandemic. In the survey, one GP expressed what may well be the views of many, noting that, \u201c[i]f things don\u2019t change in the next few weeks, I do worry that many colleagues will leave the profession, not because they have failed, but [because] the Government and the system failed them.\u201d\n\nTaking care of mental health Nevertheless, there are ways to help protect mental health through these challenging times. According to Lee Chambers, communication is key: \u201cI look at resilience as expressive rather than suppressive, an ability to express yourself rather than trying to be robust and resist. Endurance generally leads to burnout [\u2026] Being able to talk and articulate and find someone you trust to express where you are currently at.\u201d He added: \u201cResilience is like a battery. The main ways to recharge it are the fundamentals \u2014 sleeping, nutrition, movement. For me, it\u2019s trying to build those into your life.\u201d People should not be afraid to seek help and to recognize the warning signs that they may need help. \u201cIs it pervasive? Is it prolonged? And, is it something that is increasingly spiraling out of our control. At that point, we need to look to see how we can access professional services.\u201d \u2013 Lee Chambers Dr. James echoed this advice, noting that \u201c[p]eople who are struggling with their mental health can talk to their [primary care doctor] or self-refer directly to a local psychological therapy service.\u201d",
        "Share on Pinterest What is decision fatigue, and how has this phenomenon evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic? Kayla Snell/Stocksy. New Normal Health All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic. Decision fatigue happens when, after making many decisions at once, a person\u2019s ability to make decisions declines. Complex decisions, such as those posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, deplete one\u2019s capacity for decision making especially quickly. According to a survey by the American Psychological Association published in October 2021, 32% of adults in the United States struggled to make basic decisions, such as what to wear, due to COVID-19-induced stress. Different age groups reported experiencing the phenomenon at different rates: 48% of millennials\n\n37% of Generation Z\n\n32% of Generation X\n\n14% of baby boomers\n\n3% of older adults These findings correspond with the survey\u2019s findings on stress levels. Younger groups were significantly more likely to report high stress levels than older groups. Parents with children under 18 years old were also disproportionately affected by stress compared with those without children. While 47% of these parents reported that day-to-day decisions were more stressful than before the pandemic, the same was true for 30% of those without children under 18 years old. People of Color have also been more affected by pandemic-related stress. According to the study, 38% of Hispanic adults and 36% of Black adults reported that pandemic-related stress impacted their decision making, compared with 29% of non-Hispanic White adults. New Normal Health For more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub.\n\nHow the concept came to be Decision fatigue happens when a person becomes fatigued or exhausted from making too many decisions. It affects a person\u2019s ability to make further decisions, whether simple, such as deciding what to eat for dinner, or complex, such as determining whether or not to change jobs. The concept of decision fatigue originated in 1998. It centers on the idea that humans have a limited capacity to regulate their behavior. This means that after a certain point, people simply run out of energy to make decisions, much like a car running out of fuel once its petrol tank is empty. Running out of \u201cdecision making fuel\u201d is also known as ego depletion. Ego depletion changes the way we focus on and process information to make decisions, as well as our motivations. These motivational shifts can make a person more likely to make impulsive decisions that, under normal circumstances, they would not make. \u201cDoing repeated decision making [that] involves trade-offs between multiple competing values, such as risks and benefits\u201d increases a person\u2019s risk of experiencing decision fatigue, Dr. Gustav Tingh\u00f6g, an associate professor at Linkoping University in Sweden, told Medical News Today. \u201cCareful consideration of pros and cons in decision making is mentally taxing and may lead to decision fatigue when we feel stressed and mentally overloaded. This can lead people to shy away from engaging in cognitively demanding reasoning when tired and instead turn to decision\u2010making heuristics, that is, mental shortcuts that allow us to make decisions on the basis of simple rules of thumb without engaging in cognitively demanding reasoning.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Gustav Tingh\u00f6g But decision fatigue does not just happen from making decisions. It can happen from any activity that demands the exertion of self-control. Dr. Grant A. Pignatiello, an instructor and clinical research scholar at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, told MNT that \u201c[d]ecision fatigue can manifest after repeated or effortful attempts of self-control.\u201d \u201cThe most common example is from making decisions. But it can also result from controlling your emotions, doing things that require cognitive effort, or intense physical exertion,\u201d he noted.\n\nSusceptibility Several factors are associated with a higher risk of decision fatigue, including: chronic exposure to stress and work complexity\n\nto stress and work complexity low knowledge and experience of independent decision making and a lack of direct managerial supervision\n\nand a lack of direct managerial supervision a high workload\n\na lack of time to make decisions Dr. Pignatiello said that everyone is susceptible to decision fatigue. However, the exact causes will differ from person to person: \u201cIt\u2019s important to know that the circumstances that lead to decision fatigue are unique for every person \u2014 for example, two individuals doing the same thing may experience different levels of decision fatigue. For a literal example, running a 5K may deplete your tank more than it would a person who runs every day.\u201d He added that the demands of modern everyday life, alongside modern work environments, necessitate complicated decisions that may make some more susceptible to decision fatigue than others.\n\nHow to spot decision fatigue Signs of decision fatigue include brain fog, feeling tired, and other signs of physical or mental fatigue. These may intensify the more decisions a person makes throughout the day. When asked how people may be able to spot whether or not they are experiencing decision fatigue, Dr. Tingh\u00f6g said, \u201cIf there are drifts in the type of decision you are making throughout the day, without there being a logical explanation, this could be due to decision fatigue.\u201d \u201cBut also, it is possible to identify decision fatigue through introspection,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen we feel that we don\u2019t have enough mental energy to make a thorough deliberation before an important decision, we are suffering from decision fatigue.\u201d Dr. Pignatiello also noted: \u201cIt requires some self-awareness for us to know when we may be in a state of decision fatigue. Some common signs include struggling with decisions that otherwise would not require much thought, e.g., \u2018What do I eat for dinner?\u2019 \u2018What should I wear?\u2019, feeling overwhelmed by our emotions, having a harder time remembering things or focusing, or simply just feeling more \u2018drained\u2019 than normal.\u201d",
        "Cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 According to Dr. Fedorowski, \u201csomewhere between 1% and 10% of individuals [who contracted SARS-CoV-2] will develop all these [cardiovascular] complications, [such as] myocarditis, pericarditis, and even blood clots building in [the] arteries.\u201d The difficulty in treating these cases, moreover, is [because] the cardiovascular impact can be difficult to pinpoint at first. \u201cWe are talking about very small blood clots in very small arteries \u2014 they are not so easy to detect,\u201d said Dr. Fedorowski. \u201cBut some patients may report having blue fingers out of nowhere, just being infected a few days before. And this might be a sign of a very small, tiny blood clot in [the] peripheral blood arteries.\u201d The Nature Medicine study that we referred to earlier in the article shows that there is an increased risk of a whole range of cardiovascular outcomes even in those not admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19 \u2014 that is, even in milder cases of the disease. To reach this conclusion, the study authors analyzed data from a large cohort of \u201c153,760 individuals with COVID-19, as well as two sets of control cohorts with 5,637,647 (contemporary controls) and 5,859,411 (historical controls) individuals.\u201d This ongoing risk of cardiovascular issues does not apply only to adults. According to a paper in Circulation in November 2020, children can also experience acute heart failure weeks after having had a SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is likely to be an effect of long COVID in children, which is also under investigation. However, the syndrome that has most puzzled scientists regarding its association with long COVID is POTS.\n\nWhat is POTS, really? The medical community generally describes POTS, the syndrome that affects more and more people with long COVID, as a dysautonomic phenomenon \u2014 that is, something that affects the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is the body\u2019s \u201cautopilot mode,\u201d which controls key bodily functions, such as heart rate, breathing, and digestion. POTS is one of several forms of dysautonomia, alongside neurocardiogenic syncope, which involves frequent fainting spells and multiple system atrophy, a rare and fatal condition that leads to rapid systemic deterioration. The symptoms of POTS are as numerous as they are varied, ranging from lightheadedness upon standing up from a seated position to tachycardia (an abnormally rapid heart rate), shortness of breath, and digestive symptoms. This heterogeneity of symptoms can make POTS difficult to diagnose. Doctors often mistake it for an anxiety disorder , as symptoms such as a rapid heart rate and heart palpitations also occur in people who experience anxiety. \u201cThe problem with POTS is that it seems to be not only a cardiovascular problem \u2014 [a] heart and vessel problem \u2014 [but also] a problem of your nervous system, sometimes on your gastrointestinal system,\u201d Dr. Fedorowski explained. \u201cAnd in the end, we call it \u2018dysautonomia,\u2019 as it seems [to be] about your autonomic nervous system, which controls all your autonomic functions [\u2026]. And as the autonomic nervous system controls, first of all, your circulatory system, the main symptoms that you feel are from the circulatory or from your heart palpitations or blood pressure instability \u2014 you don\u2019t feel good when you stand up, and so on. But the problems are a little bit diffused,\u201d he noted, pointing out that even top specialists may find it hard to diagnose POTS correctly. Ms. Meriquez V\u00e1zquez described her experience of POTS as a life altering syndrome, and she confirmed the similarity between symptoms of POTS and those of a panic attack: \u201c[M]y POTS started as very severe adrenaline rushes along with a racing heart, especially when I was standing \u2014 I would get so nauseated and dizzy. From all of the adrenaline, it felt like a panic attack, but it would come out of nowhere.\u201d Why does adrenaline, or epinephrine, play a role? Dr. Kavi explained that \u201cthe sympathetic nervous system is the fight-or-flight system, and that\u2019s where the adrenaline [\u2026] \u2014 noradrenaline \u2014 comes in.\u201d \u201cThe parasympathetic system is the rest-and-digest system. And for us to function normally, we have to have a balance between the two \u2014 a sort of equilibrium. And it\u2019s when that equilibrium gets disrupted, and one or [the other] is overpowering that people develop problems,\u201d she explained.\n\nWhat causes POTS? The mechanisms behind POTS remain unclear, but ongoing research is searching for the likeliest explanations. A study published in February 2022 in Cells found that people with POTS have platelet storage pool deficiency, a phenomenon linked to symptoms such as frequent nosebleeds, dysmenorrhea, easy bruising, and anemia. It also showed that people with POTS have elevated inflammatory biomarkers, all of which may suggest a state of chronic inflammation. \u201c[T]he data provided [in this study] suggest that POTS is a mixed inflammatory pattern disease,\u201d the authors conclude.\n\nPOTS before and after COVID-19 Although more and more media content has started looking at POTS as a long-term effect of SARS-CoV-2 infections, POTS itself is not a newly emerged syndrome. According to data that the nonprofit organization Dysautonomia International cited well before the pandemic, an estimated 1\u20133 million people in the U.S. had POTS. Although it is unclear how many more people are seeking care in the aftermath of COVID-19 than they were pre-pandemic, anecdotal reports seem to indicate a steep increase in cases, most of them associated with long COVID. Dr. Fedorowski also told us that he and his colleagues at the Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden have been seeing an influx of people with long COVID whom doctors have referred for POTS treatment: \u201cWe experience a huge inflow of new referrals from different parts of the region of Stockholm, meaning that in the Stockholm area, [where] we have around 2.5 million citizens, [\u2026] from [that] whole area, we are getting referrals from primary care doctors [and] from other specialists from other hospitals regarding people who developed what we call \u2018long COVID\u2019 or \u2018post-COVID syndrome.\u2019 The main reason they are sent to us is that [here] is quite [a] high clinical suspicion of POTS \u2014 postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.\u201d According to Dr. Fedorowski, at almost 2 years into the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of referrals for POTS rehabilitation \u201chas doubled or tripled.\u201d Dr. Chung made a similar observation about the Johns Hopkins POTS Program, saying that he and his colleagues \u201chave [had] at least twice or three times more referrals\u201d at their clinic since the start of the pandemic, compared with pre-pandemic numbers. And Dr. Kavi told us that the situation is the same in the U.K.: \u201cHere, the feedback that I\u2019m getting from the clinicians that we work with \u2014 who run POTS services and secondary care [\u2026] \u2014 [is] that they\u2019re noticing a significant increase in their referrals. And, of course, that means that their waiting lists are getting longer as well.\u201d\n\nWho is at risk of POTS, and why? Current data indicate that the people who most commonly receive a diagnosis of POTS in long COVID are young females. However, both Dr. Fedorowski and Dr. Chung noted that there is a slight difference in the demographics of people presenting with POTS before the COVID-19 pandemic and those who have POTS associated with long COVID. According to the researchers, pre-pandemic, most people with POTS tended to be in their teens or early 20s, while people with long-COVID-associated POTS tend to be in their 30s, 40s, and 50s. Dr. Fedorowski speculated that the high levels of stress that women in these demographics often encounter, perhaps due to persistent issues of gender inequality in the home and workplace, may play a role. \u201cA lot of younger women [\u2026] get affected by POTS as a consequence of COVID-19,\u201d Dr. Fedorowski told Medical News Today. \u201cAnd if you talk to them [\u2026], then you will see a picture of a woman who is working very hard, having [a] family, taking care of children, and trying to reach some higher position in [\u2026] society; or [there] are the women who are very much stressed by feeling that they are not good enough.\u201d During the pandemic, for instance, women have continued to bear the higher burden of child care and stay-at-home orders during the early stages have also disproportionately affected working women. Research has shown that chronic stress can have a very real physiological impact, leading to impaired immune system function and cardiovascular and gastrointestinal problems. However, reflecting on the shift in POTS demographics outlined by Drs Chung and Fedorowski, Dr. Kavi wondered whether \u201cit\u2019s a real increase in older people having POTS [after COVID-19] or whether it\u2019s just not being picked up in younger people\u201d since POTS is often not given due consideration as a possible diagnosis. \u201cIn terms of pediatricians and [family doctors], for example, they often don\u2019t think about [POTS as a possible diagnosis], and then there\u2019s very little, almost nothing in the way of services for people in the U.K. with POTS that are under the age of 16, so I just don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s there and we\u2019re missing it or it\u2019s not [been] there [previously].\u201d \u2013 Dr. Lesley Kavi Ms V\u00e0zquez also wondered whether more people with long COVID are now receiving POTS diagnoses not because they have newly developed the syndrome after becoming ill with COVID-19, but because their existing POTS symptoms have worsened in the aftermath. In their online support group, she told us, people are \u201coften reflecting on how they may have had signs of autonomic dysfunction prior to getting sick [with COVID-19].\u201d Research on POTS conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic further indicates that the syndrome can be associated with various chronic conditions, including diabetes, sarcoidosis, and lupus, as well as with aggressive treatments, such as chemotherapy. There is also some suggestion that POTS can develop following a viral illness and that sometimes genetic factors may be at play. According to PoTS UK, the syndrome can have associations with inherited conditions, such as hypermobility spectrum disorder and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. POTS also has associations with mast cell activation disorder , which causes allergic symptoms.",

Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic. Share on Pinterest Research shows that people were more creative during the first COVID-19 lockdown. Lisa Schaetzle/Getty Images The American Psychological Association defines \u201ccreativity\u201d as \u201cthe ability to produce or develop original work, theories, techniques, or thoughts.\u201d While this obviously applies to artistry, it can apply equally to everyday activities in which one takes existing elements and creates something new\u2014such as using the ingredients of sourdough bread to make the pandemic food staple. A new study from the Paris Brain Institute at Sorbonne University decided to investigate the effect the first COVID-19 lockdown had on creativity. To explore its impact, they conducted a French-language online survey to learn more about people\u2019s experiences with creativity during this first lockdown in France. The study\u2019s authors hoped to reconcile the seeming paradox of heightened creativity during a time of unusual stress. The study\u2019s 343 participants said they were, on average, more creative during the lockdown than during the period before. The findings were published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology.\n\nWhat were people doing in lockdown? In addition to listing self-perceived creativity changes, or subjective creativity change (SCC), as described above, the researchers presented participants with an inventory of 28 creative activities based on existing items often used by research psychologists, including the Inventory of Creative Activities and Achievements (ICAA). These included painting, cooking, sewing, gardening, writing, and decorating, among others. Respondents were asked if they engaged in these activities more or less during the lockdown, how often, and why they did or didn\u2019t. The top five creative activities in which the study\u2019s respondents said they engaged in were cooking, sports and dance programs, self-help programs, and gardening. The researchers also inquired about pandemic obstacles that had to be overcome. There was no clear indication that a higher number of obstacles hindered creativity. The extent of obstacles encountered was high for individuals who were more creative as well as for those who were less so. \u201cThe minute you set constraints, now the creative mind gets to work on how do I achieve the goal, conditional on these constraints?\u201d said Dr. Ajay Agrawal, University of Toronto, on the Disruptors podcast. The two greatest factors in whether a person\u2019s level of creativity during the lockdown rose or fell were emotional or affective changes and\u2014to a slightly lesser degree\u2014whether the pandemic gave them more free time. The degree to which an individual exhibits openness\u2014one of the Big Five personality traits\u2014followed behind as a significant factor. The authors chose openness because this is the personality trait most associated with creativity.\n\nThe role of emotion in creavity According to the study, previous research suggests that a positive mood is correlated to creative activity, although there is still some debate. The authors of the study confirmed that participants\u2019 affective states aligned with SCC. The descriptors they asked participants about \u201cincluded anxiety and stress, motivation, psychological pressure, mood, and to a lower extent, loneliness and physical constraints.\u201d Researchers found a link between positive mood and creativity, and one between negative affective states and less creativity. Co-first author of the study Dr. Aliz\u00e9e Lopez-Persem, suggests: \u201cThere is some evidence in the scientific literature that you need to feel good to be creative, while other evidence points the other way. Also, it is not known in which direction this process takes place: do we feel good because we are creative, or does being creative make us happier?\u201d \u201cHere, one of our analyses suggests that creative expression enabled individuals to better manage their negative emotions linked to confinement and therefore to feel better during this difficult period.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Dr. Aliz\u00e9e Lopez-Persem",

In 2021, Dr. Itzhaki published a study compiling a significant body of research showing an association between activated HSV-1 and AD.\n\nHSV-1 is also extremely common, with 50% to 80% of American adults carrying the virus. While either the oral or genital form of VZV is active, it can cause painful blisters at the site of infection.\n\nDr. Itzhaki noted:\n\n\u201cWhat is known now is that infectious diseases, in general, confer a risk of AD, and our results explain this for shingles.

Allison Shelley/For The Washington Post via Getty Images A new study seeks to advance the understanding of long COVID.\n\nIt finds that long COVID can be divided into three types of conditions, depending on the type of symptoms experienced.\n\nThe authors of the study also find links between COVID-19 variants, symptoms, and long COVID\u2019s duration. All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic. As experts attempt to unravel the tangle of symptoms and long-term effects of what is collectively known as \u201clong COVID,\u201d a new study seeks to provide some clarity. Working with data collected in a health study app by personalized nutrition company ZOE, researchers from King\u2019s College London in the U.K. have begun to discern some order in the chaos. The study finds that long COVID can be grouped into three symptom-cluster types: neurological symptoms, respiratory symptoms, and systemic/inflammatory and abdominal symptoms. Neurological symptoms \u2014 the most commonly reported long COVID symptoms \u2014 include anosmia/dysosmia, brain fog, headache, delirium, depression, and fatigue. (Loss of taste from COVID is typically attributable to a loss of smell.)\n\nRespiratory symptoms involve possible damage to the lungs and include severe shortness of breath, palpitations, fatigue, and chest pain.\n\nSystemic/inflammatory and abdominal symptoms include musculoskeletal pain, anemia, myalgias, gastrointestinal disorders, malaise, and fatigue. For the study, researchers analyzed data for 336,652 individuals collected by ZOE\u2019s COVID Symptom Study. Of this group, 1,459 reported post-COVID symptoms defined as more than 12 weeks after acute COVID-19 infection. Dr. Jai Marathe of Boston University School of Medicine in Massachusetts, who was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today, \u201cThis study definitely improves our understanding of post-COVID syndrome and more importantly, who might be at risk of prolonged illness and debility.\u201d \u201cPhysicians and patients,\u201d Dr. Marathe pointed out, \u201care both looking for answers regarding who is at risk for developing long COVID, how long symptoms will last, what will help resolve the symptoms, etc. While this study does not answer all these questions, it provides a strong framework to build on.\u201d The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, has been published on the pre-print server medRXiV.\n\nHow variants affect symptoms The researchers were also able to begin to identify the symptom clusters associated with SARS-CoV-2 variants and with vaccinations. Dr. Liane S. Canas, corresponding author of the study and postdoctoral research associate at King\u2019s College London, told Medical News Today: \u201cOur results suggest that chest-related symptoms (respiratory cluster) in the U.K. population were more evident among unvaccinated patients infected by the initial form of the virus [referred to as the \u201cwild\u201d variant].\u201d \u201cDifferently,\u201d Dr. Canas continued, \u201cpatients with either the Alpha or Delta variants have shown a higher incidence of neurological symptoms, such as anosmia and brain fog.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, we could not robustly evaluate the effect of vaccination for these two variants. For Alpha, we didn\u2019t have enough individuals vaccinated at the time of infection. For Delta, we didn\u2019t have enough unvaccinated individuals at the time of infection who developed long COVID,\u201d she pointed out. Systemic/inflammatory and abdominal conditions were lightly associated with all variants.\n\nThe duration of symptoms \u201cOn average,\u201d said Dr. Canas, \u201cthe wild-type form of the virus has shown a longer prevalence of symptoms, 30 weeks when compared with Delta and Alpha at 24 and 25 weeks respectively.\u201d \u201cHowever,\u201d she noted, \u201csince we only analyzed data from individuals with illness for longer than 12 weeks, these results are less significant than the profiling of the clusters, and would require further research, which would also consider the effect of vaccination.\u201d \u201cThe findings of the study,\u201d said Dr. Marathe, \u201csuggest that individuals struggling with long COVID, who experience severe shortness of breath, hoarse voice, loss of smell, fatigue, delirium, anosmia, headache, and fever were more likely to [experience] prolonged and severe symptoms.\u201d \u201cPhysicians armed with this information,\u201d she said, \u201cmay be able to better counsel their patients and expectations for symptom improvement. They may also work towards targeted treatment approaches that address the symptom cluster impacting, and hopefully improving, clinical care for the patients.\u201d",
        "Share on Pinterest Design by Andrew Nguyen IBD is a condition that affects the gastrointestinal system. The symptoms often include abdominal cramps, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea. The symptoms can fluctuate and may last for days, weeks, or months at a time. In 2015, an estimated 3 million people in the United States had IBD. Globally, the disease affected an estimated 6.8 million people in 2017. The most common forms of IBD are Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. Both involve chronic inflammation of the digestive tract. Despite the relatively high prevalence of IBD, a great deal of misinformation and misunderstanding surrounds it. Here, we fight fiction with facts. To aid us on our quest, we have enlisted the help of Dr. Abhik Bhattacharya, assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Gastroenterology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, NY.\n\n1. IBD is the same as IBS IBD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) both affect the digestive system and have similar acronyms. This, perhaps, explains some of the confusion. However, the two conditions are not the same. Dr. Bhattacharya explained to Medical News Today that IBS \u201cis a disorder of the interaction between the gut and brain, leading to diarrhea, constipation, or both, along with bloating and pain. [It] can be worsened or precipitated by stress and anxiety.\u201d Conversely, he continued, IBD \u201cis a disease of a dysregulated immune system, wherein the immune system starts attacking your own gastrointestinal system, leading to damage.\u201d \u201cThe disease can lead to stress, worsening anxiety, depression, and loss of sleep because of the devastating consequences it can have on a person\u2019s daily functioning,\u201d he said. \u201cSymptoms can include bleeding in stools, diarrhea, severe belly pain, unintentional weight loss, fevers, chills, rectal pain, fatigue, and more.\u201d\n\n2. Stress causes IBD IBD is driven by the immune system, so stress is not the direct cause. However, as Dr. Bhattacharya explained, it \u201ccan make life very stressful.\u201d Stress can trigger IBD flares and exacerbate the symptoms in some people, which might help explain the confusion. However, stress does not cause IBD.\n\n4. Some people have both Crohn\u2019s and ulcerative colitis Crohn\u2019s and ulcerative colitis are the most common forms of IBD. However, they are distinct conditions, and people cannot have both. \u201cYou can either have Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis,\u201d said Dr. Bhattacharya. \u201cHowever, in a very small subset of patients, it is hard to determine whether they have Crohn\u2019s or ulcerative colitis. The disease, however, does reveal itself over the course of a patient\u2019s lifetime.\u201d\n\n5. No treatments can relieve IBD Thankfully, this is untrue. \u201cThere are many treatments that are extremely effective for IBD. Depending on what you have and how severe the disease is, we have a plethora of options for medical treatment,\u201d explained Dr. Bhattacharya. He then outlined some of the available interventions: \u201cThese include, but are not limited to, biologic medications, such as Remicade [infliximab], Humira [adalimumab], Cimzia [certolizumab pegol], Simponi [golimumab], Entyvio [vedolizumab], and Stelara [ustekinumab], or small molecules like Zeposia [ozanimod] and Xeljanz [tofacitinib]. These are potent immunosuppressant medications, and we are constantly developing new medications through clinical trials.\u201d\n\n6. Everyone with IBD needs surgery \u201cNo, everyone does not need surgery,\u201d Dr. Bhattacharya told MNT. He explained that in the past, a majority of people with IBD would have undergone surgery. However, \u201cwith the advent of very effective and safe immunosuppressant medications,\u201d rates of surgery have dropped significantly over the past 20 years. According to Crohn\u2019s & Colitis UK, about 15% of people with ulcerative colitis will need surgery 10 years after diagnosis. However, in agreement with Dr. Bhattacharya, the organization notes that the improved treatments available mean that this percentage is reducing. \u201cThe goal of treatment,\u201d Dr. Bhattacharya said, \u201cis to prevent surgery due to complications of bowel damage.\u201d He advocates for early treatment with potent medications soon after diagnosis. This, he explained, prevents damage, thereby removing the need for surgery.\n\n7. People should not take IBD medications during pregnancy This is not true. \u201cMost IBD medications are very safe during pregnancy,\u201d said Dr. Bhattacharya. He explained that the goal is to keep people with IBD in remission during pregnancy \u201cbecause the worst thing to happen for both baby and mother is for the disease to be active.\u201d \u201cWe have gathered, and continue to gather, a large amount of data regarding the safety of medications during pregnancy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2013 Dr. Bhattacharya There is an important exception, though: methotrexate. Dr. Bhattacharya told us that methotrexate \u201cis stopped even when women with IBD are planning to get pregnant.\u201d\n\n8. If your symptoms go, you can stop medication Once drugs for IBD take effect and the symptoms disappear, it can be tempting to stop taking the medication. However, this is not what doctors recommend. Dr. Bhattacharya told MNT: \u201cAt this moment, we don\u2019t have a good way of stopping medications for patients with IBD in remission. [\u2026] We don\u2019t recommend stopping medications.\u201d He explained that ending treatment can have serious consequences. For instance, the symptoms might come back, and if the person restarts on the same treatments, these may not work. \u201cWhile we do have options when it comes to treatment,\u201d he said, \u201cthose options are not limitless, and we don\u2019t want to run through medications. There is good data to support that when [\u2026] one set of IBD medications [fails], your response to another type may be less likely.\u201d\n\n9. A gluten-free diet cures IBD As Dr. Bhattacharya told MNT, a \u201cgluten-free diet works for [people with] celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity,\u201d but it will not benefit those with IBD.\n\n10. IBD only affects the gut Although, as the name suggests, IBD significantly affects the bowel, the disease can also have ramifications on many other parts of the body. \u201cApart from the gastrointestinal system, which includes the mouth to the anus, IBD can have extraintestinal manifestations like affecting the skin, eyes, and joints, to name a few,\u201d said Dr. Bhattacharya. According to a review of extraintestinal manifestations of IBD, they \u201ccan involve nearly any organ system [\u2026] and can cause a significant challenge to physicians managing IBD patients.\u201d For instance, IBD can affect the musculoskeletal system, as well as the eyes, kidneys, and lungs. It may also damage the hepatopancreatobiliary system, which includes the pancreas, liver, gallbladder, and bile duct.\n\n11. IBD is curable At this time, there is no cure for IBD. However, as Dr. Bhattacharya said, \u201cthis is a work in progress.\u201d Researchers are working tirelessly to understand the condition better so that they can design better treatments and, perhaps one day, a cure.",

        "Excess mortality cannot be derived for all countries when using standard methods because of gaps in the underlying data. Therefore, statistical methods are required to derive the expected and total deaths based on the levels of data available for countries; this is why these figures are called 'estimates'.\n\nThe methodology for generating the estimates adopts a statistical method called a Poisson regression model and has been developed in collaboration with the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) and an appointed Technical Advisory Group for COVID-19 Mortality Assessment.\n\nOur estimates have a range of uncertainty per country and that level of uncertainty is directly related to a country's reporting capacity and variable data quality.

        "Every year, 2 meteor showers \u2013 the famous Perseids and the lesser known Delta Aquariids \u2013 converge in late summer. The Delta Aquariids always peak in late July. And the Perseids always peak around August 12 and 13. But \u2013 in 2022 \u2013 moonlight will interfere with Perseids\u2019 peak. So we recommend you to watch in late July and early August \u2013 on multiple nights \u2013 to catch meteors in these 2 grand showers.\n\nWhen to watch: Watch late July through early August, mid-evening to dawn. There\u2019s a nominal predicted* peak on July 29, 2022. But don\u2019t worry too much about that peak date. Delta Aquariid meteors fly for weeks!\n\nNearest moon phase: In 2022, new moon falls at 17:55 UTC on July 28. And full moon will fall at 1:36 UTC on August 12. Take advantage of the moon-free mornings in late July and early August for watching the Delta Aquariids (and the Perseids).\n\nRadiant: Rises in mid-evening, highest around 2 a.m. and low in the sky by dawn.\n\nDuration of shower: July 18 to August 21.\n\nExpected meteors at peak, under ideal conditions: The Delta Aquariids\u2019 maximum hourly rate can reach 20 meteors in dark skies with no moon, when the radiant is high in the sky. If you\u2019re watching in early August, you\u2019ll be adding that number to however many Perseids you see.\n\nNote: Like May\u2019s Eta Aquariids, July\u2019s Delta Aquariids favors the Southern Hemisphere. Skywatchers at high northern latitudes tend to discount it. But the shower can be excellent from latitudes like those in the southern U.S. Delta Aquariid meteors tend to be fainter than Perseid meteors. So a moon-free dark sky is essential. About 5% to 10% of the Delta Aquariid meteors leave persistent trains, glowing ionized gas trails that last a second or two after the meteor has passed.\n\nReport a fireball (very bright meteor) to the American Meteor Society: it\u2019s fun and easy!\n\nThe Delta Aquariid\u2019s parent comet\n\nFrom Don Machholz, who has discovered 12 comets \u2026\n\nThe Delta Aquariid meteor shower\u2019s parent comet comes from the 96P/Machholz Complex.\n\nThe 96P/Machholz Complex is a collection of eight meteor showers, including the Delta Aquariids, plus two comet groups (Marsden and Kracht), and at least one asteroid (2003 EH1). These meteors showers, and these comets, appear to share a common origin (although they\u2019ve now diverged slightly in their orbits around the sun).\n\nThey are all related to the comet known as 96P/Machholz, which I discovered on May 12, 1986, from Loma Prieta Mountain in California.\n\nAt discovery, the comet was magnitude 10 and two degrees south of the Andromeda galaxy. I was using my 6-inch homemade binoculars for this find. Read the story of the discovery.\n\nAs a matter of fact, scientists had suspected the existence of the 96P/Machholz Complex in 2003. Finally, they fully described it in 2005, after conducting more studies.\n\nComet 96P/Machholz orbits the sun every 5.3 years and gets eight times closer to the sun than we are. That is, its perihelion distance is 0.12 astronomical units (AU). One AU is the distance between the Earth and the sun. So this comet comes well inside the orbit of Mercury. Over the course of 4,000 years, the comet\u2019s orbit changes in shape and tilt, so that it leaves particles throughout the inner solar system. It gets around!\n\nA recent study suggests that the material causing the Delta Aquariid meteor shower left the comet\u2019s nucleus about 20,000 years ago. It\u2019s old dust streaking across our skies.\n\nPerseid? Or Delta Aquariid?\n\nPerseid and Delta Aquariid meteors fly in our skies at the same time of year. How can you tell them apart? This is where the concept of a radiant point comes in handy. If you trace all the Delta Aquariid meteors backward, they appear to radiate from a certain point in front of the constellation Aquarius, which, as viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, arcs across the southern sky.\n\nMeanwhile, the Perseids radiate from the constellation Perseus, in the northeast to high in the north between midnight and dawn as seen in Northern Hemisphere skies.\n\nSo \u2013 assuming you\u2019re in the Northern Hemisphere, and watching around midnight or after \u2013 if you\u2019re watching the Perseids and you see meteors coming from the northeast or north \u2026 they are Perseids. If you see them coming from the south \u2026 they are Delta Aquariids. In a particularly rich year for meteors, if you have a dark sky, you might even see them cross paths!\n\nConsequently, it can be an awesome display.\n\nDelta Aquariid meteor shower photos from the EarthSky community\n\nSubmit your night sky photos to EarthSky here\n\nBottom line: The nominal peak of the Delta Aquariid meteor shower is late July. But the shower rambles along steadily in late July and August, intermingling with the Perseids. In 2022, watch in late July and early August.\n\n*Predicted peak times and dates for 2022 meteor showers are from the American Meteor Society. Note that meteor shower peak times can vary.\n\nEverything you need to know: Perseid meteor shower",

        "Jacqui Wise Kent\n\nThe largest study of confirmed monkeypox cases to date has identified new clinical symptoms that are similar to those of syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections and could easily lead to misdiagnosis.1 These symptoms included single genital lesions and sores on the mouth or anal mucosa.\n\nAn international collaboration across 16 countries reported 528 infections that were diagnosed between 27 April and 24 June 2022. In the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, 95% of these patients presented with a rash, 73% had anogenital lesions, and 41% had mucosal lesions.\n\nA 10th of the patients (54) had only a single genital lesion. Another unexpected finding was that 15% had anal or rectal pain (or both).\n\nThe study authors said that the current case definitions for monkeypox should be expanded to help diagnosis and slow the spread of infection. Existing definitions do recommend consideration of monkeypox in the context of any \u201cunusual\u201d rash but do not cover the full range of possible manifestations.\n\n\u201cThe current international case definitions need to be expanded to add symptoms that are not currently included, such as sores in the mouth, on the anal mucosa, and single ulcers,\u201d said Chloe Orkin, professor of HIV medicine at Queen Mary University of London and director of the Sexual Health and HIV All East Research (SHARE) collaborative, which is based in east London and investigates the inequalities that lead to poor sexual health and HIV. Orkin added, \u201cThese particular symptoms can be severe and have led to hospital admissions, so it is important to make a diagnosis. Expanding the case definition will help doctors more easily recognise the infection and so prevent people from passing it on.\u201d\n\nIn the case series, 98% of the people infected were gay or bisexual men, 75% were white, and 41% had HIV. Common systemic features preceding the rash included fever (62%), lethargy (41%), myalgia (31%), headache (27%), and lymphadenopathy (56%). Among the 23 patients with a clear exposure history the median incubation period was seven days (range 3-20).\n\nTransmission was suspected to have occurred through sexual activity in 95% of the cases. Monkeypox virus DNA was detected in 29 of the 32 people in whom seminal fluid was analysed. However, this may be incidental, as it is not yet known whether it is present at high enough levels to facilitate sexual transmission.\n\n\u201cIt is important to stress that monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted infection in the traditional sense; it can be acquired through any kind of close physical contact,\u201d said study author John Thornhill, a consultant physician in sexual health and HIV and clinical senior lecturer at Barts NHS Health Trust and Queen Mary University of London. \u201cHowever, our work suggests that most transmissions so far have been related to sexual activity\u2014mainly, but not exclusively, among men who have sex with men.\u201d\n\nMost of the cases reported in the series were mild and self-limited, and there were no deaths. The study also found that HIV infection was not linked to monkeypox severity. Although 13% of the patients were admitted to a hospital, no serious complications were reported in the majority of those admitted. Common reasons for admission were pain and bacterial superinfection. However, the study authors pointed out that rare serious complications, including myocarditis and epiglottitis, were observed and that therefore longer term follow-up of cases was needed.\n\nCommenting on the study, Claire Dewsnapp, president of the British Association for Sexual Health, said the UK government must be bold in acting against monkeypox. \u201cThese measures must include an effective vaccine procurement and delivery plan, a clearly accountable national response lead, and a national plan for testing, assessment, treatment, and prevention,\u201d she said.\n\nAs of 18 July 2022 there were 2137 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the UK, 2050 of them in England. Almost three quarters (73%) of England\u2019s cases were in London.2\n\nIn response to the rising number of cases the UK Health Security Agency said that it had procured an additional 100 000 doses of the smallpox vaccine Imvanex. Gay and bisexual men at high risk of exposure to monkeypox will be offered the vaccine.34\n\nOn 19 July the UK Health Security Agency also updated its guidance for close contacts of a confirmed monkeypox case.5 This said that close contacts won\u2019t need to isolate at home if they don\u2019t have symptoms, as the latest data showed that a relatively small number of close contacts had gone on to develop monkeypox and there was a lack of evidence of transmission outside close intimate or sexual contact.",

        "Elisabeth Mahase The BMJ\n\nOne in eight covid-19 patients (12.7%) is likely to experience long term symptoms, a study from the Netherlands has reported.1\n\nUsing digital questionnaires, researchers collected data on the frequency of 23 symptoms commonly associated with covid in an uninfected population and in people who had had a covid diagnosis.\n\nThe findings, published in the Lancet,1 found that 21.4% (381/1782) of adults who had had covid experienced at least one new or severely increased symptom three to five months after infection when compared with before. This compared with only 8.7% (361/4130) of uninfected people followed over the same period.\n\nThe core long covid symptoms highlighted by the researchers include chest pain, difficulties breathing, pain when breathing, painful muscles, loss of taste and smell, tingling extremities, lump in throat, feeling hot and cold, heavy arms or legs, and general tiredness.\n\nThe questionnaire was sent out 24 times to the same people from March 2020 to August 2021. During this period people would have been infected with alpha or an earlier variant, and most people were unvaccinated.\n\nOver 76 000 participants completed a total of 883 973 questionnaires, the average age of respondents was 54, and 61% were female. A group of 4231 (5.5%) participants who had covid were then matched to 8462 controls who did not, taking into account sex, age, and the time of covid diagnosis.\n\nAranka Ballering, study author and a PhD candidate at the University of Groningen, Netherlands, said, \u201cBy looking at symptoms in an uninfected control group and in individuals both before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, we were able to account for symptoms which may have been a result of non-infectious disease health aspects of the pandemic, such as stress caused by restrictions and uncertainty.\n\n\u201cPost-covid-19 condition is an urgent problem with a mounting human toll. Understanding the core symptoms and the prevalence of post-covid-19 in the general population represents a major step forward for our ability to design studies that can ultimately inform successful healthcare responses to the long term symptoms of covid-19.\u201d\n\nThe authors acknowledged some limitations to the study, including that it did not include an ethnically diverse population and that because of asymptomatic infection they may have underestimated the true prevalence of covid-19. Additionally, some symptoms that have been highlighted as potentially relevant to long covid, such as brain fog, were not considered during the study.\n\nThis article is made freely available for personal use in accordance with BMJ's website terms and conditions for the duration of the covid-19 pandemic or until otherwise determined by BMJ.

        "Dann M Mitchell , professor of climate science , Y T Eunice Lo , fellow in climate and health Cabot Institute for the Environment, University of Bristol, UK\n\nThe UK recently well and truly surpassed its daytime and night time highest temperature records. A previous national daytime record of 38.7\u00b0C, set in 2019, was broken when temperatures rose above 40\u00b0C in the UK for the first time on 19 July and reached a new high of 40.3\u00b0C in Lincolnshire. That night, the previous overnight record of 23.9\u00b0C (recorded in 1990) was also broken, with the temperature provisionally hitting 25.8\u00b0C in Surrey.\n\nHeatwaves are often called \u201csilent killers,\u201d and are one of the clearest examples of an environmental hazard that leads to adverse health outcomes.\n\nOver the past two decades we have seen changes in individual heatwave characteristics that can be attributed to human induced climate change\u2014and in the past five years we have even detected an increase in excess mortality from heatwaves attributable to human activity. Attribution analysis is complex and time consuming, but a provisional rapid fire analysis by the World Weather Attribution has suggested that this event was made at least 10 times more likely by human induced climate change, although that number can change quite a bit depending on how the event is defined. It is therefore extremely likely that more excess deaths have occurred in this heatwave than would have without climate change.\n\nTypically, around 1000-2000 heatwave excess deaths occur during a UK summer, but extremely hot summers can see as many as 2500. An estimated 850 people lost their lives in England and Wales between 18 and 19 July, when the UK issued its first red warning for extreme heat since launching the warning system in 2021.\n\nWhen heatwaves become unprecedented, cascading impacts start to be very relevant. A clear example of negative physical and mental health outcomes from this heatwave were the fast paced and widespread wildfires.\n\nWildfires per se are not uncommon in the UK. A high risk of dangerous fire exists in around 10% of summers, but we expect the risk to more than double if we miss the upper goal set out in the Paris Climate Agreement. This goal sets out the ambition to limit global average warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, and our planet is already at around 1.1\u00b0C above the baseline. Wildfires around London on 18 and 19 July meant that the capital\u2019s firefighters saw their busiest day since the second world war, and point toward areas of adaptation required to manage the effects of future climate change.\n\nWell informed and targeted information and advice from the government and the media, before and during heatwaves, are critical to keeping the community protected, and in helping to hammer home the importance of implementing climate policies to limit future climate change.\n\nSome recent media reporting has been excellent, alluding to the dangers of the heat and highlighting the role of climate change, but elsewhere misinformation, and denialism are rife. Some sections of the press downplayed, belittled, or attempted to counter the expert opinions of meteorologists and climate scientists, including launching personal attacks on them.\n\nNo one quite thought we would see the narrative of the satirical movie \u201cDon\u2019t Look Up\u201d played out in real life, but we did. A clip from the film, where an astronomer warns in a TV interview that a comet is hurtling towards that earth and will completely destroy it, and is told by the news anchor \u201cto keep the bad news light,\u201d went viral, with similarities drawn with the real life coverage of the heatwave. In reality, one news presenter said meteorologists were \u201charbingers of doom\u201d for stating that heatwaves lead to excess deaths. Meanwhile the editorial of a major UK newspaper said, \u201cListening to apocalyptic climate change pundits\u2026 you\u2019d think Britain was about to spontaneously combust\u201d on day one of the heatwave, then ran with the headline \u201cHottest UK day ever\u2026 nightmare of the wildfires\u201d the following day, seemingly unaware of the contradiction. We even saw a large anti-climate lobby group implying that the \u201cnightmare\u201d wildfires were caused by people pushing a pro-climate action agenda.\n\nMore and more we see how effective social media influencers can be in these types of communications, with this heatwave being one of the clearest examples. As with the traditional media, we saw some excellent reporting and advice from some of the well known science based authors and broadcasters, but we also heard the voices of disinformation and scepticism amplified through enhanced visibility from non-scientific creators with many thousands of followers, for example through tagging on Twitter.\n\nDownplaying, ignoring, or misreporting the catastrophic health impact of heatwaves costs lives. It costs lives at the time of the event, through giving the public an unrealistic view of the risk, and it costs lives in the longer term by hindering the climate change negotiation process.\n\nHeatwaves are only part of the global burden of climate change on health, but events like the 2022 UK record breaker act as a stark reminder for why urgent emission reductions are necessary. We have options available to us, what we need now is the national and international collaborative spirit to bring them to bear.",
        "We used data from a large cohort of people with covid-19 infection that occurred in December 2021 to examine the relative difference in covid-19 mortality between the delta and omicron BA.1 variants. Our study shows that the risk of covid-19 death was reduced by 66% after infection with the omicron BA.1 variant compared with the delta variant after adjusting for a wide range of potential confounders, including vaccination status and comorbidities. Importantly, we found that the relative risk of covid-19 death after omicron infection versus delta infection varied by age, with lower relative risk in younger people. The risk also varied by vaccination status, with the difference in covid-19 death between the delta and omicron BA.1 variants being lower for all vaccination statuses but less pronounced for people who had received two vaccinations.\n\nBecause the emergence of the omicron variant resulted in an increased rate of transmission, the number of people infected with the omicron variant in our sample increased considerably across the study period. To account for the difference in infection rate across the period, a cubic spline for calendar time was included in models 2-4. While the BA.2 subvariant of omicron does not have the spike gene deletion that causes SGTF, the UK only recorded an increase in the number of people with subvariant BA.2 in the week commencing 3 January 2022. 13 Our data include omicron compatible and delta compatible infections identified between 1 and 30 December 2021, which was a period when BA.1 was prominent and omicron could be identified from SGTF. These results provide clear evidence that in the UK the risk of covid-19 mortality after infection with omicron is considerably less than for delta.\n\nOur results extend these initial analyses quantifying the risk of omicron severity in terms of hospital admission to covid-19 mortality. Nyberg and colleagues 8 report a reduction in death after omicron infection (hazard ratio 0.31) compared with delta, which is similar to our findings. Importantly, our results account for more sociodemographic factors and comorbidities, and highlight that the reduction in risk remains consistent even after adjusting for these additional variables. Furthermore, our study specifically quantifies the risk of cause specific covid-19 mortality, using death registration data, unlike previous work which has defined covid-19 death as death within 28 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.\n\nEarly work exploring the clinical severity of the covid-19 omicron variant in a South African cohort found considerably reduced odds of hospital admission after SGTF versus non-SGTF infection across the same period. 7 A subsequent study in California on positive PCR tests between 30 November 2021 and 1 January 2022 also showed risk reductions for hospital admission, ICU admission, and mortality after omicron infection compared with delta infection. 10 In Canada, in a matched sample, the risk of hospital admission or death was found to be 65% lower among those with the omicron variant than in people with the delta variant. 11 Emerging evidence has found that omicron replicates more readily in the upper airways than the lungs, potentially indicating a biological mechanism for the reduction in risk of covid-19 death after infection with omicron compared with delta. 12\n\nStrengths and limitations of this study\n\nWe used a large sample of positive cases from the national testing programme, allowing us to estimate the relative risk of covid-19 death after infection with omicron BA.1 and delta. By linking these infection data to information on vaccination status, comprehensive sociodemographic characteristics from the census and information on pre-existing conditions based on primary care and hospital data, we were able to estimate the relative difference in mortality between the omicron BA.1 and delta variants, adjusting for a wide range of potential confounders, including vaccination status with manufacturer type and key worker status. We also tested whether the relative mortality risk for omicron BA.1 versus delta depended on vaccination status and the number of comorbidities by including interactions between variant type and vaccination status (or comorbidities). This is an important result because we show that regardless of vaccination status omicron was milder than delta. However, no difference was found by number of comorbidities. To control for the prioritisation of the vaccination rollout, we adjusted for the interaction between vaccination status and age.\n\nWe used death certificate data to confirm covid-19 mortality, which prevented people who died from other causes after a positive covid-19 test being included in our sample. Additionally, it is important to note that the number of covid-19 deaths was low in people younger than 70 years of age, with 68.1% of events occurring in those aged \u226570. However, we had sufficient power to show important risk reductions in younger age groups, adjusting for a wide range of potential confounders. We also compared the outcomes during the same time periods to minimise bias from management of patients with covid-19 in healthcare settings during the pandemic.\n\nOne study limitation is an ascertainment bias because the data do not cover all SARS-CoV-2 infections, but only a subset of people who tested positive as part of the national testing programme in the community and analysed by Lighthouse laboratories. Tests conducted in the community but processed by other laboratories and tests conducted in hospitals could not be used because they do not use the S gene molecular diagnostic assay, which we used to identify the variant type. A limitation of our work is not having access to data to determine covid-19 variants from tests in hospital (NHS pillar 1), which explains why our total sample is smaller than those used in other research.8 Differences in testing behaviours between groups could bias the estimates of risk of covid-19 death among people who tested positive. If some people only get tested if they experience severe symptoms, the estimated risk of death would be higher in this group than in people who get tested more routinely, even if the population has the same underlying risk. To mitigate this issue, we also adjusted the models for factors that might affect the propensity to get tested and might also be related to the severity of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, including ethnicity, region, calendar date of infection, and key worker status. However, adjusting for these factors in models 3 and 4 had little effect on our overall estimates, suggesting that any selection effects according to these characteristics had smaller impacts than might be hypothesised. One explanation for this could be the restriction of our analysis to a short time period when both variants were circulating. Sociodemographic information was obtained from the 2011 census, which was the most up to date at the time of the study, however future validation work should be conducted when 2021 census data have been released and potentially using more breakdowns of variables, such as region.\n\nBecause of death registration delays, not all deaths that occurred in the period might have been registered at the time of the study. Deaths that occurred among people who tested positive in late December are less likely to have been registered than those that occurred in people who tested positive at the beginning of the month. As the proportion of omicron BA.1 infections increased during December, the delay in death registration, if unaccounted for, could lead to underestimation of the severity of the omicron BA.1 variant. However, we accounted for the effect of registration delay in December by adjusting for calendar time of infection in our models, reducing the difference between omicron BA.1 compared with delta as expected. To fully assess the impact of covid-19, additional outcome measures such as hospital admission need to be considered. Furthermore, if the data allow, symptom profiles could be used to predict outcomes to enable better management of healthcare requirements.",

        "Smell and taste disorders tended to be overlooked by clinicians before the covid-19 pandemic, possibly because these senses were considered as unessential for life compared with vision and hearing.50 As a result of the covid-19 pandemic, patients and doctors may now be aware that these are major problems that could adversely impact quality of life, personal-social functioning, mental health, general health, and safety, long after patients recover from covid-19.\n\nIn this meta-analysis of time-to-event data from 3699 patients in 18 studies, an estimated 74%, 86%, 90%, and 96% of patients self-reported smell recovery and 79%, 88%, 90%, and 98% self-reported taste recovery at 30, 60, 90, and 180 days, respectively. On the basis of parametric cure models, persistent smell or taste dysfunction might develop in about 5% of patients. Sensitivity analyses suggest this could be an underestimate. Female sex was associated with poorer recovery of both smell and taste, whereas greater initial severity of dysfunction and nasal congestion were associated with poorer smell recovery only.\n\nComparison with other studies\n\nThis study used comprehensive, flexible statistical modelling to estimate the recovery curves and the proportion of patients who develop persistent smell and taste dysfunction post-covid-19. We used statistical cure models to investigate recovery from smell and taste dysfunction post-covid-19, and potentially our methods could be expanded to cover other major symptoms.\n\nOur recovery curves are consistent with the findings of recent studies, which suggest that recovery from smell and taste dysfunction mostly occurs early in the course of covid-19.751 More importantly, our cure models are consistent with other studies that explored the point prevalence of persistent dysfunction at long follow-up durations of six months to one year.22234952 We had excluded these studies as they did not provide appropriate graphs for reconstruction of IPD for this meta-analysis. These studies reported 9.0% of patients having little or no improvement in sense of smell at six months52; and 7.0-8.6% still had functional anosmia or persistent to worsening smell or taste impairment at one year,2249 which corresponds with our cure model predictions of 3-11% of patients who develop persistent dysfunction. This provides support for the external validity of our findings and suggests that these patients are less likely to experience recovery. Nonetheless, recovery even after many years remains possible, based on previous studies of post-viral olfactory loss53; thus patients with covid-19 should be followed-up over the long term.\n\nThe differential recovery rates could be explained by the underlying mechanisms of smell and taste dysfunction post-covid-19. Briefly, conductive barriers can prevent odorants and tastants from reaching receptors, and sensorineural interference can block sensory receptor function or signal transmission to the brain. Sensorineural mechanisms are currently thought to be the predominant mechanism of covid-19 related smell dysfunction,5455 although conductive mechanisms have been implicated too.56 SARS-CoV-2 infects and eliminates most olfactory epithelial support (sustentacular) cells that express angiotensin converting enzyme-2, which leads to olfactory neuron deciliation and necrosis.5557 Varying regeneration speed of support cells and sensory neurons, influenced by the degree of inflammation, could explain the delayed smell recovery. Stem cell damage and severe inflammation may also prolong smell dysfunction by slowing the regeneration of olfactory epithelial.57 For taste dysfunction, binding of SARS-CoV-2 to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptors in the salivary glands could impair salivary flow, leading to \u201cconductive\u201d taste dysfunction.58 Viral binding with oral mucosal cells might trigger inflammation, abnormal cell turnover, and reduced tastebud sensitivity and thus sensorineural taste dysfunction,5859 which may have varying regeneration speed. As these hypotheses have not been explored in association with recovery rates, further mechanistic research is warranted among the different patient subpopulations with rapid recovery or persistent dysfunction.\n\nAlthough it is unsurprising that higher initial severity of smell dysfunction may prolong recovery, it is not clear why female sex is associated with poorer recovery and is notably consistent with previous reports of post-viral smell dysfunction disproportionately affecting women.60 One reason could be the better baseline olfaction and gustation in female participants,6162 which may result in greater sensitivity to changes and a larger subjective impairment. Biological explanations are also possible, as oestrogen upregulates the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme-2, and the enzyme\u2019s gene is located on the X chromosome.63 These findings suggest that the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptor\u2014the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 virus, may have higher expression in women, or may express heterodimers that alter virus binding,64 thus potentially enhancing viral invasion in women. Furthermore, immune related X linked genes are more activated in the immune cells of women.64 Although acute inflammation promotes olfactory epithelial regeneration, chronic inflammation is detrimental to recovery.6566 These factors could possibly account for the poorer observed recovery in women and should be investigated further. It is also unclear why recovery of taste occurs faster in Asian countries. One possibility is the ethnic differences between continents, which may affect smell or taste perception,67 as well as susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 virus.68 Alternatively, intercontinental genetic variations in SARS-CoV-2 might influence biological mechanisms.168 As many of the included studies did not specify the ethnic distribution of participants, however, further research is required to explain this phenomenon.\n\nOur findings suggest an important burden from persistent smell and taste dysfunctions. Presently it is unknown if these sensory impairments might be associated with long term health related consequences. Smell dysfunction could predict the development of depression69 and is potentially associated with neurodegenerative disorders, often heralding neurological and cognitive manifestations by several years.70 Although recent studies of long covid have already reported a substantial burden of brain fog,71 anxiety, and depression,72 it remains uncertain if persistent smell dysfunction after covid-19 might prognosticate an increased risk of long term neurological sequelae or neurodegenerative disorders.13 With more than 550 million people worldwide confirmed as having covid-19 as of July 2022, of whom about 50% report smell or taste dysfunction,2 just 5.6% and 4.4% of patients with persistent smell and taste dysfunction translates to more than 15 million and 12 million patients with long term smell and taste dysfunctions, respectively. These patients may require further investigation, longitudinal follow-up, and appropriate treatment.\n\nFinally, these findings should also be considered in the light of recent viral mutations. The omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant is associated with a less noticeable reduction in loss of smell and taste compared with the delta and alpha variants.73 This has contributed to increasing difficulty in detecting omicron using a symptom based testing approach. In particular, one large study found that only 13-16% of patients lost their sense of smell and taste during the period when the omicron variant was dominant, compared with 44% when the delta variant dominated.73 This may be secondary to alterations in the omicron spike protein,74 which might result in less effective cell membrane fusion and olfactory host cell entry. Therefore, smell and taste recovery could also follow a different course after an omicron related infection. Although smell and taste dysfunction are less common with omicron, the fourfold transmissibility of omicron compared with the delta variant may still imply a net increase in the prevalence of chemosensory disorders.75 As we found no relevant studies in our systematic search that stratified recovery according to SARS-CoV-2 variant, this remains an important area of future research.",
        "There have been reports of the Zika virus being detected in the urine and saliva of two patients in Brazil. But experts in the UK have emphasised that the Zika virus is spread by mosquitoes and that it is found mainly in the blood. This means that avoiding mosquito bites is the most important way of preventing infection with the Zika virus. Although some of the virus may find its way into other body fluids, such as urine and saliva, this will be in such small amounts that the chance of any of the virus finding its way into the bloodstream of another person is extremely low, said the experts.",
        "Christopher Dye , professor of epidemiology , Moritz U G Kraemer , associate professor of computational and genomic epidemiology Department of Biology, University of Oxford, UK Correspondence to: C Dye christopher.dye{at}zoo.ox.ac.uk\n\nHere\u2019s what we know, and what we need to know\n\nBetween 4 and 25 May, 221 confirmed (by reverse transcriptase PCR) and 86 suspected cases of monkeypox have been reported from 23 countries in Europe plus Argentina, Australia, Canada, United Arab Emirates, and the United States.1 Such a large number of cases has never previously been reported from so many countries outside Africa in just a few weeks. New cases are being reported daily; more can be expected and in more locations. Why the extraordinary surge now? What do we need to know to stop it?\n\nAlmost all patients so far are male (three are female) and presented with symptoms typical of monkeypox, including fever, vesicular rash, skin lesions and ulcers, and swollen lymph nodes.2 The first case in this outbreak was a man who visited Nigeria from the UK.3 He developed a rash on 29 April before leaving Nigeria, arriving back in the UK on 4 May. He was immediately isolated at a London hospital on the same day. His contacts on the flight to the UK, together with others in the community plus healthcare staff, are being followed for 21 days, considered the upper limit of the incubation period for monkeypox.4 By 24 May, none of these contacts had reported symptoms.\n\nAnother 70 confirmed cases have been reported in the UK (all in England except one in Scotland), in several different groups. There is evidently person-to-person transmission within groups but no known links between groups or with the first case in England. One group is a household of three; another is four men who identify as gay or bisexual and seem to have been infected in London.5 Other than the man who was the first case, none have recently visited, or are known to have contacts that visited, endemic areas of Africa.\n\nInformed response Against this background, at least six lines of investigation will help to develop national and global responses in the coming days and weeks. The first is to find out whether the exceptionally large number of exported infections is linked to the increased frequency of travel to and from endemic areas of Africa now that covid restrictions have been lifted. If it is, published travel schedules between countries will help to specify and then mitigate risk around the world. The second is to investigate whether and how the spread of monkeypox is being driven by a rise in case numbers at source in west and central Africa. The number of monkeypox cases increased in Africa between 1970-79 and 2010-19 following the demise of smallpox and the decline in smallpox vaccination, especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).67 This rise has included major outbreaks, the largest of which affected 17 states of Nigeria in 2017-18.89 Thirdly, the main routes of transmission need to be re-examined. The 2017-18 Nigerian epidemic was caused by multiple introductions from animals (most likely rodents) to humans, plus limited and perhaps non-sustaining chains of transmission between people.81011 Now, however, waning immunity to smallpox and smallpox (vaccinia) vaccine could have magnified the risk of sustained transmission between people, within and beyond Africa.1213 The relative importance of different transmission routes could also have changed. Close contact is normally needed to acquire infection from skin lesions, body fluids, exhaled droplets, or contaminated clothing and bedding. The discovery of cases among gay and bisexual men, notably in Canada, Spain, and the UK, points to sex as one among other forms of close contact, although monkeypox is not primarily a sexually transmitted disease. Fourthly, we need to reassess what proportion of infections cause severe or fatal disease. Historically, two different genomic clades of monkeypox virus have been described in west and central Africa.7 All cases so far genotyped in Europe during the current outbreak are more closely related to the west African clade and to viruses exported from Nigeria to Israel, Singapore, and the UK in 2018 and 2019.1415 The west African clade has been associated with milder illness and a lower case fatality rate (roughly 4%) than the central African clade (roughly 10%).7 If some infections are asymptomatic, as previously described,11 these estimates of case fatality could be too high. Asymptomatic cases might also be missing links in transmission chains. Case fatality, and the risk of severe disease, can be reduced with some antivirals effective against poxviruses, but there is undoubtedly more to be learnt about supportive and therapeutic clinical care.16 The fifth line of investigation is to determine whether monkeypox could evolve, or has recently evolved, to become more pathogenic or more transmissible, or transmissible in a different way. Monkeypox virus is genetically variable and adaptable. The two main African clades consist of multiple lineages and many variants within each lineage. One genetic deletion identified in samples from DRC has been associated with human-to-human transmission.17 Clinical, epidemiological, and genomic surveillance is vital to detect possible changes in mode of transmission, human susceptibility, infectiousness, and pathogenicity.1518 Lastly in this short list, the effectiveness of vaccination in protecting individuals and populations should be further evaluated. Because smallpox is caused by an orthopoxvirus closely related to monkeypox, pre-exposure inoculation with vaccinia vaccine is efficacious (about 85%) against monkeypox disease and probably also reduces onward transmission.19 Post-exposure inoculation gives less protection, so vaccine effectiveness in practice\u2014assessed, for example, while tracing and vaccinating contacts of cases20\u2014will depend on what proportion of people at risk can be immunised before rather than after acquiring infection. On present evidence, monkeypox is unlikely to become a global health emergency. Nevertheless, vigilance and open minded investigation are needed worldwide because until these and other questions are answered, we will not know how best to contain the unprecedented spread of this disease.\n\nFootnotes Competing interests: The BMJ has judged that there are no disqualifying financial ties to commercial companies.

        "Melina Zachariou The BMJ\n\nMonkeypox symptoms seen in patients attending four sexual health clinics in London appear to differ from those seen in previous outbreaks in Nigeria, Sudan, and the US, a study has found.1\n\nResearchers from the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and Imperial College London looked at the 54 cases diagnosed during a 12 day period in May 2022. They found that patients had a lower prevalence of tiredness and fever than seen in previously studied outbreaks. Skin lesions on genitals also appeared to be more common in this outbreak, while lesions on the face were less frequently seen.\n\nStudy co-author Ruth Byrne from the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, said, \u201cIt is possible that at various stages of the infection monkeypox may mimic common sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as herpes and syphilis, in its presentation. It\u2019s important that sexual health clinicians and patients are aware of the symptoms of monkeypox as misdiagnosis of the infection may prevent the opportunity for appropriate intervention and prevention of onward transmission. Additional resources are urgently required to support services in managing this condition.\u201d\n\nAs of 30 June, the total number of confirmed monkeypox cases in the UK has risen to 1235.2\n\nThe paper, published in Lancet Infectious Diseases, found that patients were all symptomatic and presented with skin lesions. A total of 49 (94%) had at least one skin lesion on the genital or perianal skin, and around nine out of 10 (37, 89%) had skin lesions affecting more than one anatomical site. Just over half of patients (30, 55%) had lymphadenopathy (swelling of lymph nodes), while one in four patients had a concurrent STI.\n\nPatients mostly experienced a mild illness and recovered while isolating at home, however five people required hospital admission because of pain or infection of the skin lesions. All improved and were discharged, with an average of seven days spent in hospital.\n\nAll patients included in the study identified as men who have sex with men (MSM). The median age was 41 years and 70% (38 of 54) were white. All except two patients were not aware of having been in contact with a known case and none reported travel to sub-Saharan Africa, although many had recently visited other European countries.\n\nComparison with previous outbreaks The researchers found the prevalence of fatigue, asthenia, or lethargy among patients (67%, 95% confidence interval, 54 to 79) was much lower than seen in previous outbreaks in Nigeria and the US (over 80%). Fewer patients also reported fever or febrile chills (57%, 95% CI 44 to 71), compared with outbreaks in Nigeria, Sudan, and the US (85% to 100%). Skin lesions on the genital or perianal skin were more frequently seen in patients included in this study (94%), compared with two thirds in previous outbreaks, while the prevalence of lesions on the face and neck was much lower in this study, at around one fifth compared with 62% to 97% previously. But, commenting on the paper, Boghuma Kabisen Titanji, assistant professor of medicine at Emory University, Atlanta, said the findings were consistent with the new cases now being reported around the world. She said, \u201cThe findings are similar to those reported in cohorts from EU countries and the US. One in four people in this cohort had a concurrent STI which may reflect the study being conducted in sexual health clinics but could also reflect the overlap between how monkeypox is presenting in the ongoing outbreak and common STIs. It highlights the need to clarify the mechanisms of transmission in the current outbreak better to inform policies and approaches to contain it.\u201d The authors noted that their data was subject to selection biases as current guidance and health promotion materials are focused on promoting monkeypox testing in symptomatic people who self-define as MSM. They have stressed that it is important to remain alert to the possibility of spread to other groups while still balancing targeted health promotion to groups disproportionately affected by the current outbreak."

        "Results 1 951 866 and 3 219 349 eligible adults received two doses of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively, and 2 422 980 remained unvaccinated. Waning of vaccine effectiveness was estimated to be similar across outcomes and vaccine brands. In the \u226565 years subgroup, ratios of adjusted hazard ratios for covid-19 related hospital admission, covid-19 related death, and positive SARS-CoV-2 test ranged from 1.19 (95% confidence interval 1.14 to 1.24) to 1.34 (1.09 to 1.64) per four weeks. Despite waning vaccine effectiveness, rates of covid-19 related hospital admission and death were substantially lower among vaccinated than unvaccinated adults up to 26 weeks after the second dose, with estimated vaccine effectiveness \u226580% for BNT162b2, and \u226575% for ChAdOx1. By weeks 23-26, rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 test in vaccinated people were similar to or higher than in unvaccinated people (adjusted hazard ratios up to 1.72 (1.11 to 2.68) for BNT162b2 and 1.86 (1.79 to 1.93) for ChAdOx1).\n\nWe did a cohort study within the OpenSAFELY-TPP database ( https://opensafely.org ), which includes detailed linked data on 24 million people (approximately 44% of the English population) registered with an English general practice using The Phoenix Partnership (TPP) SystmOne electronic health record software. We compared rates of covid-19 related hospital admission, covid-19 related and non-covid-19 related mortality, and infection with SARS-CoV-2, between adults fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) or the Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 AZD1222 (ChAdOx1) vaccine and those who were unvaccinated.\n\nExamination of waning of covid-19 vaccine effectiveness is difficult. The success of vaccine rollouts in many countries means that only a small and selected proportion of the population remains unvaccinated and uninfected. Continuing uptake of vaccination, as well as ongoing infection with SARS-CoV-2, further depletes this group over time. Vaccines were offered in priority order determined by age and clinical vulnerability, so that the longest follow-up is in people at the highest risk of severe covid-19. Rapid changes in rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection over time, related to pandemic control measures and introduction of new variants, make accounting for the calendar date on which events occurred essential. Many studies of waning covid-19 vaccine effectiveness have used \u201ctest negative case-control\u201d designs, restricted to people tested for infection with SARS-CoV-2 and comparing those testing positive (cases) and negative (controls) 5 9 17 18 or reported indirect evidence such as changing rates of covid-19 with time since vaccination. 11 12 The extent to which test negative case-control designs control bias due to confounding, or are biased because of the restriction to people who were tested, remains unclear. 19 20\n\nThe effectiveness of covid-19 vaccines, first shown in randomised trials, 1 2 has been confirmed with longer follow-up in observational studies. 3 4 5 However, neutralising antibody titres decrease with time since vaccination, 6 7 8 and vaccine effectiveness against infection wanes over time. 5 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 The extent of waning of vaccine effectiveness against severe covid-19 is less clear: studies have found no evidence of waning, 9 10 17 modest waning, 5 11 or substantial waning. 12 Clarification of rates of waning effectiveness is needed to determine the frequency with which booster doses are needed and whether booster vaccination should be targeted at groups defined by age, clinical vulnerability, or brand of primary vaccine.\n\nPublic contributors were not involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor in developing plans for design or implementation of the study. No public contributors were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. Covid-19 vaccination is offered to the whole population, including the researchers involved in the study. The main barriers to involving external public contributors were the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic, which means that evidence quickly becomes outdated, and the urgent need to conduct and disseminate the research. OpenSAFELY invites any patient or member of the public to make contact with the project via https://opensafely.org/ .\n\nWe did all analyses independently in four vaccine priority subgroups: aged \u226565 years and in JCVI groups 2-5, aged 18-64 years and clinically vulnerable (JCVI groups 4 or 6), aged 40-64 years (JCVI groups 7-10; most people in this subgroup received ChAdOx1), and aged 18-39 years (JCVI groups 11-12; this subgroup received only BNT162b2). The \u226565 subgroup included participants who were clinically vulnerable, whereas the 40-64 and 18-39 subgroups did not. We fitted additional models separately in men and women to investigate effect modification by sex and in 65-74 and \u226575 years subgroups to investigate effect modification by age in older adults.\n\nWe used meta-regression to quantify waning vaccine effectiveness as ratios of hazard ratios per comparison period. The ratios of hazard ratios can be interpreted as follows: if the hazard ratio in the three to six week comparison period is 0.5 and the ratio of hazard ratios is 1.2, then the hazard ratios will be 0.6 (=0.5\u00d71.2), 0.72 (=0.5\u00d71.2 2 ), 0.86 (=0.5\u00d71.2 3 ), 1.04 (=0.5\u00d71.2 4 ), and 1.24 (0.5\u00d71.2 5 ) in the 7-10, 11-14, 15-18, 19-22, and 23-26 week comparison periods respectively.\n\nTo estimate hazard ratios, we fitted Cox regression models with baseline hazards stratified by JCVI group, eligibility date, and region used to define the second vaccination periods, and with the covariates described above. To avoid problems with model convergence, we excluded binary covariates from the model if any cell of the table defined by cross tabulating the covariate with vaccine group and comparison period contained fewer than three events. For categorical covariates with more than two levels, levels were merged until either all levels had more than three events or only one level existed, in which case the variable was excluded. We carried out this process independently for each outcome. We modelled age within strata as linear, with quadratic terms additionally included for strata with age range >5 years.\n\nFor each comparison period, we estimated hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 recipients versus unvaccinated people, ChAdOx1 recipients versus unvaccinated people, and BNT162b2 versus ChAdOx1 recipients. We did not estimate hazard ratios for comparison periods with fewer than three events in either group. For each person, follow-up ended at the earliest of the outcome of interest, deregistration from the primary care practice, death, or 15 December 2021. However, for SARS-CoV-2 test, follow-up ended at the \u201coutcome of interest\u201d only when the test result was positive. Fully vaccinated people who received a booster dose, and unvaccinated people who received a first dose were excluded from subsequent comparison periods, but follow-up within comparison periods was not censored after these events.\n\nModels were adjusted for the following potential confounders: age, sex (male or female), English Index of Multiple Deprivation (grouped by fifths), ethnicity (black, mixed, South Asian, white, other, as per the UK census), body mass index, learning disability, serious mental illness, number of comorbid conditions in different organ systems (supplementary table S3), current pregnancy, number of SARS-CoV-2 tests between 18 May 2020 (when widespread testing became available) and eligibility for first vaccine dose, and receipt of one or more flu vaccines in the five years before the start of the second vaccination period.\n\nThe outcomes were covid-19 related hospital admission (identified using Hospital Episode Statistics inpatient hospital records), covid-19 related death, positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and non-covid-19 related death. We also investigated test seeking behaviour by comparing rates of testing for SARS-CoV-2 between the vaccine groups. Covid-19 and non-covid-19 related deaths (death certificates with and without a covid-19 code) were based on death registry data from the Office for National Statistics. We identified SARS-CoV-2 tests by using SGSS records, on the basis of swab date. Both polymerase chain reaction and lateral flow tests were included, without differentiation between symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. We defined all outcomes by the date of their first occurrence during the comparison follow-up period. Where no positive SARS-CoV-2 test was present, but a record of covid-19 related hospital admission and/or death was recorded, we imputed the date of positive SARS-CoV-2 test as the date of covid-19 related hospital admission or death.\n\nWe followed up unvaccinated people for the full eight calendar weeks that spanned the comparison periods for vaccinated people. To avoid overlap in follow-up of unvaccinated people between comparison periods (see lines corresponding to unvaccinated individuals E-L in figure 1 ), follow-up time for unvaccinated people was assigned at random to start either two or six weeks after the start of the second vaccination period and was split into the three consecutive eight week calendar periods during which vaccinated people were followed in each comparison period. Unvaccinated people assigned to start at two weeks were followed during comparison periods 1, 3, and 5, and those assigned to start at six weeks were followed during comparison periods 2, 4, and 6.\n\nIllustrative example showing definition of four week comparison periods, within strata defined by Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation group, eligibility date, and region. Horizontal lines represent follow-up time for four vaccinated and eight unvaccinated people, and colours of lines correspond to six comparison periods. Individuals A and D received their second vaccinations on first and last day of second vaccination period (SVP), respectively\n\nFigure 1 depicts the study design. The analysis timescale was calendar time, which ensured that vaccinated and unvaccinated people were compared on the calendar day on which each outcome event occurred. We split follow-up time for fully vaccinated people into six consecutive four week \u201ccomparison periods,\u201d starting two weeks after receipt of the second dose. Because each second vaccination period was four weeks long and each vaccinated person was followed up for four weeks per comparison period, vaccinated people were followed during eight calendar weeks in each comparison period. Vaccinated people entered and finished follow-up on the calendar dates corresponding to the start and end of their comparison period.\n\nWe defined the second vaccination period as the four week period during which the greatest number of people in the stratum received their second dose. We excluded people from the vaccine groups if they received their first dose before their eligibility date, had an interval between first and second dose of less than six or more than 14 weeks, or were flagged as a healthcare worker on their vaccination record. We assigned people to the unvaccinated group if they had received no covid-19 vaccine at the start of the second vaccination period for their analysis stratum. We excluded people from any group if they had evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection by the start of their second vaccination period (either a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in SGSS or probable covid-19 coded in primary care records), had ever been recorded as being resident in a care home, or had evidence of having started an end-of-life care pathway.\n\nWe defined three groups who received two doses of BNT162b2, received two doses of ChAdOx1, or were unvaccinated. Eligibility for the vaccinated groups was restricted to people who received their second vaccine dose during a four week \u201csecond vaccination period\u201d within analysis strata defined by UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) priority groups (supplementary table S1), eligibility date (for priority groups within which eligibility was based on age; supplementary table S2), and English NHS region (defined using individuals\u2019 primary care practice address).\n\nThis study was approved by NHS England. People were eligible for inclusion if they were aged \u226518 years on 1 July 2021 and had been registered with a primary care doctor for at least one year before eligibility for their first vaccine dose (the \u201celigibility date,\u201d supplementary table S2). People were excluded if they were aged >120 years on the date at which they became eligible for vaccination; their sex, geographical region, ethnicity, or English Index of Multiple Deprivation were unknown; or they were resident in a care home or medically housebound at six weeks after their eligibility date. Full details are in supplementary figure S1.\n\nWe observed no consistent differences between vaccine effectiveness in men and women. For ChAdOx1, adjusted hazard ratios seemed to be broadly similar in men and women. For BNT162b2, vaccine effectiveness against covid-19 related hospital admission seemed to be somewhat greater in women than in men in the \u226565 subgroup but greater in men than in women in the 18-39 subgroup (supplementary tables S51-58; supplementary figures S32-35).\n\nEstimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 with ChAdOx1 recipients consistently favoured BNT162b2 ( fig 3 ; supplementary table S7; ratios of adjusted hazard ratios in supplementary table S8). In the \u226565 and 18-64 and clinically vulnerable subgroups, estimated adjusted hazard ratios were 0.51 (0.33 to 0.79) and 0.36 (0.23 to 0.55), respectively, for covid-19 related hospital admission during weeks seven to 10; 0.58 (0.36 to 0.94) and 0.49 (0.20 to 1.18), respectively, for covid-19 related death during weeks 15-18; and 0.68 (0.52 to 0.88) and 0.35 (0.29 to 0.41), respectively, for positive SARS-CoV-2 test during weeks three to six. Because the rate of waning was slightly higher for BNT162b2 than ChAdOx1, the adjusted hazard ratios for both the \u226565 and 18-64 and clinically vulnerable subgroups were attenuated by weeks 23-26, but they still favoured BNT162b2 over ChAdOx1 (0.69 (0.61 to 0.78) and 0.47 (0.38 to 0.57), respectively, for covid-19 related hospital admission; 0.65 (0.48 to 0.86) and 0.54 (0.28 to 1.05), respectively, for covid-19 related death; and 0.75 (0.72 to 0.78) and 0.70 (0.67 to 0.72), respectively, for positive SARS-CoV-2 test).\n\nWe observed 1 406 181, 2 907 849, and 674 534 SARS-CoV-2 tests in BNT162b2 recipients, ChAdOx1 recipients, and unvaccinated people, respectively (only the first test in each comparison period counted; supplementary table S5). Across subgroups, rates of testing during weeks three to six were higher in vaccinated people than in unvaccinated people; adjusted hazard ratios ranged from 1.55 (1.50 to 1.61) to 2.09 (2.03 to 2.15) for BNT162b2 and from 2.01 (1.95 to 2.08) to 2.79 (2.75 to 2.83) for ChAdOx1 (supplementary figure S30; supplementary tables S7 and S8). The discrepancy in testing behaviour between the vaccinated and unvaccinated people increased slightly by weeks 23-26; adjusted hazard ratios ranged from 2.06 (2.00 to 2.13) to 3.06 (2.66 to 3.53) for BNT162b2 and from 2.31 (2.27 to 2.36) to 3.70 (3.64 to 3.76) for ChAdOx1.\n\nWe observed 8463, 9135, and 3031 non-covid-19 related deaths in BNT162b2 recipients, ChAdOx1 recipients, and unvaccinated people, respectively (supplementary table S5). Across subgroups, estimated adjusted hazard ratios during weeks three to six ranged from 0.29 (0.24 to 0.35) to 0.47 (0.34 to 0.64) for BNT162b2 and from 0.29 (0.20 to 0.44) to 0.36 (0.30 to 0.44) for ChAdOx1 ( fig 2 ; supplementary table S7). By weeks 23-26, these ranged from 0.55 (0.40 to 0.76) to 0.58 (0.48 to 0.69) for BNT162b2 and from 0.64 (0.43 to 0.95) to 0.74 (0.61 to 0.90) for ChAdOx1. Rates of waning were lower than for the other outcomes (maximum ratio of adjusted hazard ratios 1.19 (1.09 to 1.31); supplementary table S8).\n\nWe observed 62 363, 186 137, and 118 216 positive SARS-CoV-2 tests in BNT162b2 recipients, ChAdOx1 recipients, and unvaccinated people, respectively (supplementary table S5). For BNT162b2 recipients compared with unvaccinated people, estimated adjusted hazard ratios across subgroups ranged from 0.19 (0.13 to 0.27) to 0.27 (0.23 to 0.31) during weeks three to six and from 0.87 (0.78-0.97) to 1.72 (1.11 to 2.68) during weeks 23-26 ( fig 2 ; supplementary table S7). For ChAdOx1 recipients compared with unvaccinated people, estimated adjusted hazard ratios ranged across subgroups from 0.43 (0.32 to 0.58) to 0.78 (0.75 to 0.81) and waned to 1.23 (1.11 to 1.36), 1.35 (1.29 to 1.41), and 1.86 (1.79 to 1.93) in the \u226565, 18-64 and clinically vulnerable, and 40-64 subgroups, respectively. For BNT162b2, ratios of hazard ratios were 1.29 (1.23 to 1.35), 1.30 (1.23 to 1.36), 1.32 (1.17 to 1.49), and 1.54 (1.50 to 1.59) in the \u226565, 18-64 and clinically vulnerable, 40-64, and 18-39 subgroups, respectively (supplementary table S8). For ChAdOx1, ratios of hazard ratios were 1.19 (1.14 to 1.24), 1.14 (1.11 to 1.17), and 1.20 (1.16 to 1.25) in the \u226565, 18-64 and clinically vulnerable, and 40-64 subgroups, respectively.\n\nWe observed 329, 595, and 889 covid-19 related deaths in BNT162b2 recipients, ChAdOx1 recipients, and unvaccinated people, respectively (supplementary table S5). In the \u226565 subgroup, estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 recipients with unvaccinated people were 0.02 (0.01 to 0.07) during weeks three to six after the second dose and those comparing ChAdOx1 recipients with unvaccinated people were 0.04 (0.02 to 0.09) during weeks seven to 10 after the second dose. These estimates waned to 0.12 (0.08 to 0.17) and 0.15 (0.11 to 0.21) for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively, by weeks 23-26 ( fig 2 ). The ratios of adjusted hazard ratios per period were 1.34 (1.09 to 1.64) and 1.31 (1.07 to 1.61) for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively. In the 18-64 and clinically vulnerable subgroup, estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 recipients with unvaccinated people were 0.04 (0.02 to 0.09) during weeks 15-18 after the second dose and those comparing ChAdOx1 recipients with unvaccinated people were 0.05 (0.02 to 0.16) during weeks seven to 10 after the second dose. These estimates waned to 0.08 (0.04 to 0.18) and 0.13 (0.08 to 0.20) for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively, by weeks 23-26. The ratios of adjusted hazard ratios per period were 1.38 (0.77 to 2.47) and 1.21 (0.99 to 1.49) for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively. Estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing ChAdOx1 recipients with unvaccinated people in the 40-64 subgroup waned from 0.02 (0.01 to 0.07) during weeks 11-14 to 0.10 (0.04 to 0.22) during weeks 23-26 (ratio of adjusted hazard ratios 1.66 (1.08 to 2.55) per period). Too few covid-19 related deaths occurred in the 18-39 subgroup to allow estimation of hazard ratios.\n\nWe observed 2100, 5369, and 9443 covid-19 related hospital admissions in BNT162b2 recipients, ChAdOx1 recipients, and unvaccinated people, respectively (supplementary table S5). Estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 recipients with unvaccinated people in the \u226565 subgroup were 0.08 (95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.13) and 0.13 (0.08 to 0.23), respectively, during weeks three to six after the second dose, waning to 0.20 (0.17 to 0.25) and 0.25 (0.21 to 0.29), respectively, during weeks 23-26 ( fig 2 ). The ratios of adjusted hazard ratios per period were similar for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1: 1.26 (1.17 to 1.36) and 1.23 (1.07 to 1.40), respectively. Estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 recipients with unvaccinated people in the 18-64 and clinically vulnerable subgroup were 0.05 (0.02 to 0.12) and 0.09 (0.06 to 0.14), respectively, during weeks three to six, waning to 0.09 (0.07 to 0.12) and 0.23 (0.19 to 0.26), respectively, by weeks 23-26. The ratios of adjusted hazard ratios per period were 1.23 (1.13 to 1.35) and 1.20 (1.14 to 1.27) for BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively. Estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing ChAdOx1 recipients with unvaccinated people in the 40-64 subgroup waned from 0.05 (0.04 to 0.07) during weeks three to six to 0.12 (0.10 to 0.15) during weeks 23-26 (ratio of adjusted hazard ratios 1.24 (1.16 to 1.33) per period). Adjusted hazard ratios for BNT162b2 could not be estimated in the 40-64 subgroup because too few covid-19 related hospital admissions occurred. Estimated adjusted hazard ratios comparing BNT162b2 recipients with unvaccinated people in the 18-39 subgroup waned from 0.04 (0.02 to 0.07) during weeks three to six to 0.18 (0.10 to 0.29) during weeks 19-22 (ratio of adjusted hazard ratios 1.31 (1.10 to 1.57) per period).\n\nFigure 2 shows adjusted hazard ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) for BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 vaccination versus no vaccination across the six comparison periods. The slopes of the lines correspond to ratios of adjusted hazard ratios per comparison period (also shown in supplementary table S8). The missing adjusted hazard ratios could not be estimated because too few events occurred in one or both groups (supplementary table S5).\n\nUnadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios are shown in supplementary tables S6 and S7, respectively, and compared in supplementary figures S24-29, with adjusted hazard ratios for each covariate shown in supplementary tables S9-50. For the models comparing people fully vaccinated with BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 with unvaccinated people, the unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios were generally similar. Where they differed, patterns were outcome and subgroup specific. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios were similar for comparisons of BNT162b2 with ChAdOx1.\n\nSupplementary figures S20-23 show the distribution of follow-up by calendar time in each comparison period, for each subgroup, relative to dates during which different variants were dominant. Follow-up in the \u226565 subgroup began on 15 March 2021 (when the alpha variant was dominant) and ended on 30 November 2021. Follow-up for the 18-64 and clinically vulnerable, 40-64, and 18-39 subgroups began on 21 April, 18 May, and 23 July 2021, respectively: the delta variant was dominant in England by 1 June 2021. The latest follow-up was on 15 December 2021; 54% of specimens sampled in England on this date had S-gene target failure, which suggests that the omicron variant became dominant in England by this date. 24\n\nThe cumulative incidence of first vaccine dose by week 23 in previously unvaccinated people was 16%, 28%, 13%, and 14% in the \u226565, 18-64 and clinically vulnerable, 40-64, and 18-39 subgroups respectively (supplementary figure S19). The UK vaccination programme initially offered third doses only after six months (23-26 weeks) since the second dose 21 ; however, among the 18-39 subgroup, 35% and 26% of those in the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 groups, respectively, had received a third dose by week 20, because the required time since second dose was reduced to three months in early December 2021 owing to concerns about the omicron variant. 22 23\n\nOf 13 841 107 people satisfying initial eligibility criteria (supplementary figure S2), 5 222 812 received second doses of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 during the second vaccination period for their stratum (supplementary figures S3-18) and 2 575 111 were unvaccinated at the start of their second vaccination period. Of these, 1 951 866, 3 219 349, and 2 422 980 were eligible for inclusion in the first comparison period for BNT162b2, ChAdOx1, and unvaccinated groups, respectively. Table 1 and supplementary table S4 show summary statistics for these three groups by subgroup. Compared with vaccinated people, unvaccinated people were less likely to be white, to live in a more affluent area, to have had a flu vaccine in the previous five years, or to have tested for SARS-CoV-2 before their eligibility date. The distribution of other characteristics between vaccine groups differed according to subgroup. For example, in the \u226565 subgroup, those vaccinated with BNT162b2 were older than those vaccinated with ChAdOx1 (75 (interquartile range 72-80) years) versus 72 (70-75) years, whereas the converse was true in the 40-64 subgroup (44 (41-50) years versus 55 (50-59) years).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis cohort study estimated the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 covid-19 vaccines during six consecutive periods, each of four weeks\u2019 duration, starting two weeks after receipt of second dose. Rates of covid-19 related hospital admission and covid-19 related death were consistently and substantially lower among fully vaccinated people compared with those who remained unvaccinated, up to 26 weeks after the second vaccination, and consistently lower among people fully vaccinated with BNT162b2 than with ChAdOx1. However, by 23-26 weeks, rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 test (ascertained through freely available national routine testing) in fully vaccinated people were similar to or higher than those in unvaccinated people. Rates of non-covid-19 related death were consistently lower among fully vaccinated than unvaccinated people.\n\nWhen quantified as ratios of adjusted hazard ratios, estimated waning of vaccine effectiveness was strikingly similar across risk groups, except that waning was fastest in the 18-39 year subgroup (those at lowest risk of severe covid-19, all vaccinated with BNT162b2). In those subgroups in which the two vaccines could be compared, estimated vaccine effectiveness was consistently greater for BNT162b2 than for ChAdOx1, but waning was somewhat faster for BNT162b2 than ChAdOx1, so that the two brands\u2019 comparative effectiveness became more similar over time. Estimated adjusted hazard ratios for covid-19 related hospital admission and covid-19 related death remained \u22640.20 (\u226580% vaccine effectiveness) for BNT162b2 and \u22640.25 (\u226575% vaccine effectiveness) for ChAdOx1 during weeks 23-26 after the second vaccination.\n\nFindings in context A systematic review and meta-regression of the duration of effectiveness of covid-19 vaccines included 18 studies, most of which evaluated BNT162b2 or Moderna\u2019s mRNA-1273 vaccine.13 Estimates of vaccine effectiveness and the duration of vaccine effectiveness varied substantially between studies. Only two studies found minimal vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection by six months, and none found decreases in vaccine effectiveness against positive SARS-CoV-2 test as large as those reported in our study.914 The meta-regression estimated an average decrease in vaccine effectiveness from one to six months after full vaccination across studies of 9.5 (95% confidence interval 5.7 to 14.6) percentage points for severe covid-19 (hospital admission or death due to covid-19), and of 20.7 (10.2 to 36.6) percentage points for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The corresponding reductions in the \u226565 subgroup in our study were: covid-19 related hospital admission 12.8 (7.41 to 18.2) for BNT162b2 and 11.7 (3.44 to 20.0) for ChAdOx1; positive SARS-CoV-2 test 68.2 (56.4 to 80.0) for BNT162b2 and 79.6 (62.0 to 97.2) for ChAdOx1. However, the ratios of adjusted hazard ratios in the \u226565 subgroup in our study were similar for covid-19 related hospital admission (1.26 (1.17 to 1.36) for BNT162b2 and 1.23 (1.07 to 1.40) for ChAdOx1) and for positive SARS-CoV-2 test (1.29 (1.23 to 1.35) for BNT162b2 and 1.19 (1.14 to 1.24) for ChAdOx1). Thus, the metric used to quantify waning vaccine effectiveness can lead to strikingly different conclusions about its magnitude. The review concluded that the decline in vaccine effectiveness against severe covid-19 was less than for SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptomatic disease. However, by quantifying waning in terms of ratios of hazard ratios, we found that rates of waning were similar for these two outcomes (supplementary table S8). As in our study, Andrews and colleagues analysed NHS England electronic health records data to investigate the duration of protection by covid-19 vaccines against symptomatic and severe covid-19.5 They used a test negative case-control design, which aims to reduce confounding due to health seeking behaviour by considering only people who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection.25 However, this restriction to the subpopulation of people who are tested if they have symptoms has potential biases. For example, if older people were more likely to seek testing when they had symptoms then vaccine effectiveness in the tested subpopulation may differ from that in the general population.20 The restriction to those tested can also induce so-called \u201ccollider bias,\u201d because associations between causes of being tested are distorted in the tested subpopulation.26 Comparisons between this study and that of Andrews and colleagues are restricted to the \u226565 and 40-64 subgroups, as these are identically defined in the two studies, and to the 15-18 weeks comparison period in this study and the 15-19 weeks since second dose in the other study, which were the most similar across the two studies. Compared with Andrews and colleagues, we consistently estimated lower effectiveness for both vaccines against covid-19 related hospital admission (differences ranged from 1.3 to 6.4 percentage points). Andrews and colleagues concluded (by contrast with our study) that waning was greater for ChAdOx1 than BNT162b2 and greater among older adults and those in a clinical risk group. Whereas those authors found continuing vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic covid-19 up to 26 weeks after receipt of the second vaccine dose, we found rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 test to be similar to or higher than those in unvaccinated participants by that time. Most of the follow-up in our study was while the delta variant was dominant in England. Previous studies found vaccine effectiveness to be lower for the delta variant than the alpha variant,31827 and lower for the omicron variant than the delta variant.2829 Consistent with the findings of this study, infection in vaccinated people has been widespread since the omicron variant became dominant; an estimated 71% of people in England had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by 22 April 2022.30 It will be important to extend the analyses reported in this study to examine longer term effectiveness of two dose vaccination, and waning effectiveness of booster vaccination, against the omicron variant.\n\nStrengths and limitations of this study Our study is based on whole population data analysed within the OpenSAFELY Trusted Research Environment, which has stringent disclosure controls to protect patients\u2019 privacy. The large study size and large numbers of outcome events led to precise estimates of vaccine effectiveness according to brand of vaccine and time since second vaccine dose. We accounted for risk dependent vaccine allocation by separating the cohort into subgroups based on JCVI group,31 and by doing analyses within strata defined by JCVI group, eligibility date for primary vaccination, and geographical region. We fully accounted for rapid changes in incidence of covid-19 with calendar time, because the risk sets underpinning the Cox models compared people being followed on the calendar day when outcome events occurred. Our analyses also excluded people with a pre-vaccine rollout record of SARS-CoV-2 infection and accounted for censoring due to occurrence of outcome events and attenuation of comparison groups because of receipt of first vaccine dose by unvaccinated people and third dose by fully vaccinated people. The OpenSAFELY platform contains an unprecedented scale of NHS records that are refreshed every week, and the methods used for data storage and management facilitate rapid re-execution of all curation and analysis code. This will enable us to regularly reassess waning vaccine effectiveness over extended time intervals, the impact of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, and the effects of further doses of covid-19 vaccines. Our study has several limitations. Firstly, as in any observational study, our estimates could be affected by confounding by unmeasured factors. The detailed linked data analysed permitted adjustment for a wide range of potential confounding factors, but we may not have been able to control completely for the associations of being vaccinated with health seeking behaviours and being less socioeconomically deprived. Secondly, patients registered with a primary care practice who have moved or emigrated (or whose death was not recorded)32 may contribute person time but not events. Because the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 groups are defined by recent vaccination, these \u201cghost\u201d patients are more likely to be present in the unvaccinated group, leading to bias in estimates of waning. Also, healthcare workers could be identified and excluded from the vaccinated groups, because this information was recorded at the time of vaccination, but not from the unvaccinated group. This limitation should not affect results for the \u226565 subgroup, most of whom are retired, or comparisons between BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1. Thirdly, consistent with an Australian survey,33 we found that unvaccinated people had tested less frequently than vaccinated people during the pre-vaccine rollout period when widespread testing was available (table 1) and were considerably less likely to be tested during follow-up (supplementary table S7). Fourthly, differential depletion of susceptible people in the unvaccinated groups over time may lead to attenuation of hazard ratios even when true vaccine effectiveness does not change. However, such bias is likely to be minimal when vaccine effectiveness is high.34 Fifthly, we excluded people vaccinated outside defined \u201csecond vaccination periods\u201d and estimated hazard ratios within four week periods subsequent to second vaccination. Modelling non-linear interactions of vaccine effectiveness with time since vaccination is a potentially more powerful approach that could avoid excluding so many people but would rely on more complex modelling assumptions than those underpinning our analyses.",

A request for examples on Twitter quickly drew dozens of responses including from immunosuppressed people who had attended for chemotherapy or scans and had been asked to remove their high-filtration FFP2 or FFP3 respirator and replace it with a single-use disposable mask as a condition of entry.2 In some, but not all, examples, the individual had been able to negotiate putting the single-use mask on top of their respirator.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is an airborne pathogen which is transmitted when people inhale viral particles that infected individuals exhale when speaking, coughing, sneezing, and even just breathing.345 In contrast with droplet infection which usually occurs via a single ballistic hit, airborne infection risk increases incrementally with the amount of time the lining of the lungs spend continuously exposed to viral-laden air\u2014in other words, with time spent indoors breathing contaminated air.6\n\nSingle-use disposable masks substantially reduce (but, importantly, do not entirely eliminate) the egress of SARS-CoV-2 particles into the air from infected individuals (\u2018source control\u2019), hence a policy of requiring such masks is\u2014to the extent that people comply\u2014likely to substantially reduce the amount of virus circulating in the air and the overall level of transmission.789 However, single-use disposable masks are relatively ineffective at preventing ingress of viral particles in inhaled air (in other words, they do not adequately protect the wearer).7 This is partly because, unlike respirators (e.g. FFP2, FFP3, N95, N99), disposable masks are not made to any minimum filtration standard. But it is mainly because such masks often fit poorly, allowing air to enter around the gaps.10\n\nDowngrading masks and limiting protection matters for everyone. It puts us at greater risk of infection and thereby increases disruptions to our individual lives, increases load on the NHS, and exacerbates workforce shortages. However, it has a particular impact on those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. By April 2021, the UK\u2019s shielding programme had identified more than four million people who were at highest risk of severe illness from covid-19.11 Due to the much higher mortality rates in this group, the government went to great lengths early in the pandemic to protect them, advising them to leave home only to exercise or attend healthcare appointments. Use of health services by people classed as clinically vulnerable fell dramatically in the early months of the pandemic.11 There is anecdotal evidence that clinically vulnerable people in the UK are still choosing to avoid their GP and hospital appointments and cancel their operations rather than risk entering a healthcare facility in which few people are adequately masked.12 That they may be told to remove their own high-grade respiratory protection is an additional disincentive to accessing healthcare, with potential adverse consequences in the short- or longer-term.\n\nAsking patients and visitors to downgrade their masks is not limited to the UK. In a report from the US, healthcare facilities allegedly cited guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to justify such a policy.13 In British Colombia, Canada, a downgrade-your-mask policy is the subject of an ongoing class action lawsuit under province-wide human rights legislation.\n\nIt is unlikely that \u201cdowngrade your mask\u201d commands issued at the threshold of healthcare facilities were introduced as a deliberate policy intended to create disincentives and inequities for the most vulnerable patients. On the contrary, we believe they are the unintended consequence of two interacting influences, which we take in turn.\n\nFirst, poor understanding of transmission dynamics. It is hardly surprising that front line administrative staff misunderstand how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted. Major policy advisory bodies including the World Health Organisation, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Public Health England made confident announcements early in the pandemic that the virus was spread predominantly by droplets (which were believed to contaminate hands, objects, and surfaces) and that handwashing and surface cleansing were therefore the most crucial infection control measures. While face masks were depicted as \u201cfomites\u201d (accumulating concentrated virus as they became wet with exhaled droplets), the air people breathe was rarely depicted as a potential reservoir of infection except in rare circumstances such as the aerosol-generating procedures conducted by specialist doctors. Using this flawed mental model, replacing a \u201cdirty\u201d mask with one that is known to be \u201cclean\u201d before entering a healthcare facility makes sense.\n\nSecond, a rigid \u201ccompliance\u201d culture. A compliance organisation is defined as one that passively takes policy in from a regulator, implements that policy, and monitors how well it is followed (i.e. the only data collected in this case is whether visitors are wearing the issued masks).14 In contrast, a learning organisation is one where local implementation of policy is accompanied by feedback loops intended to evaluate and improve policy\u2014for example, by measuring nosocomial infection rates and systematically analysing complaints about the policy from patients or staff.15 Given that rigidity is associated with burnout and that increased cognitive load can often reduce flexibility of thinking, it is hardly surprising that we are seeing increasing instances of a \u201ccompliance\u201d culture in today\u2019s overloaded, burnt out NHS.161718\n\nThe above factors may help explain local downgrade-your-mask policies, but they do not excuse them. The practice is not supported by evidence, puts patients and others at risk, excludes vulnerable people from health services, thereby exacerbating health inequalities, and could potentially lead to expensive lawsuits. More widely, at a time when covid prevalence is at an all-time high and clear and consistent messages are needed about the importance of wearing high-filtration well fitting masks, when NHS staff suggest that loose paper masks are better than respirators, it becomes all the harder to persuade people that the opposite is the case.19\n\nIf, conversely, the NHS were to provide all visitors with free FFP2 or FFP3 masks to replace paper or cloth masks, it would bring multiple benefits within and beyond healthcare settings. It would address the alarming dropoff of health service usage by clinically vulnerable people and it would constitute a powerful public health intervention. It is time for the NHS to switch its policy from downgrading to upgrading masks.\n\nFootnotes Competing interests: TG, SR and BK are members of Independent SAGE.

        "Conclusions These findings confirm the ongoing unprecedented community transmission of monkeypox virus among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men seen in the UK and many other non-endemic countries. A variable temporal association was observed between mucocutaneous and systemic features, suggesting a new clinical course to the disease. New clinical presentations of monkeypox infection were identified, including rectal pain and penile oedema. These presentations should be included in public health messaging to aid early diagnosis and reduce onward transmission.\n\nResults The median age of participants was 38 years. All 197 participants were men, and 196 identified as gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men. All presented with mucocutaneous lesions, most commonly on the genitals (n=111 participants, 56.3%) or in the perianal area (n=82, 41.6%). 170 (86.3%) participants reported systemic illness. The most common systemic symptoms were fever (n=122, 61.9%), lymphadenopathy (114, 57.9%), and myalgia (n=62, 31.5%). 102/166 (61.5%) developed systemic features before the onset of mucocutaneous manifestations and 64 (38.5%) after (n=4 unknown). 27 (13.7%) presented exclusively with mucocutaneous manifestations without systemic features. 71 (36.0%) reported rectal pain, 33 (16.8%) sore throat, and 31 (15.7%) penile oedema. 27 (13.7%) had oral lesions and 9 (4.6%) had tonsillar signs. 70/195 (35.9%) participants had concomitant HIV infection. 56 (31.5%) of those screened for sexually transmitted infections had a concomitant sexually transmitted infection. Overall, 20 (10.2%) participants were admitted to hospital for the management of symptoms, most commonly rectal pain and penile swelling.\n\nSetting A regional high consequences infectious disease centre with associated primary and secondary care referrals, and affiliated sexual health centres in south London between May and July 2022.\n\nThe observed clinical features of monkeypox infection in the 2022 UK outbreak differ from those in historical reports. We describe the characteristics and clinical features of monkeypox infection in people managed through a single south London centre and present a series of novel presentations.\n\nhas an epidemiological link to a confirmed or probable case of monkeypox in the 21 days before symptom onset\n\nA person with an unexplained rash on any part of their body plus one or more classical symptom or symptoms of monkeypox infection*\u2020 since 15 March 2022 and either:\n\nA person with an illness where the clinician has a high suspicion of monkeypox (for example, this may include prodrome or atypical presentations with exposure histories deemed high risk by the clinician, or classical rash without risk factors).\n\nA person with a febrile prodrome* compatible with monkeypox infection where there is known prior contact with a confirmed case in the 21 days before symptom onset.\n\nMonkeypox is designated as a high consequence infectious disease in the UK. 18 In the 2022 outbreak, the rapid community spread meant that most infected individuals were managed at home after risk assessment. 19 The box shows the current UK Health Security Agency case definition of possible and probable monkeypox infection. 20\n\nThe incubation period of monkeypox is currently understood to be about 12 days (range 5-24 days). 11 12 Classic descriptions of monkeypox infection depict biphasic clinical features, with a prodromal phase characterised by fever, malaise, sweats, lymphadenopathy, and headache, followed by skin eruption 2-4 days later. 11 Skin lesions follow a typical pattern of evolution, starting as macules and progressing into papules, vesicles, and pustules, which subsequently crust over and then desquamate. 13 15 Historically, lesions have appeared simultaneously and progressed sequentially. 16 Lesions have predominantly affected the face (95% of infected people), palms and soles (75%), mucous membranes (70%), and, less commonly, genitals. 5 Most infections are self-limiting and relatively mild, with symptoms lasting 2-4 weeks. Severe manifestations of infection include encephalitis, secondary skin infection, pneumonia, and ocular disease leading to loss of vision. Higher risk populations include neonates, children, and those with immunodeficiency. 17\n\nMonkeypox is due to an orthopoxvirus, which rarely causes disease in humans. Although the exact reservoir of the virus is still unknown, rodents are suspected to play a part in transmission. The virus was first identified in 1958, among primates in captivity for research purposes. 4 Two genetically distinct viral clades are described: Central African (Congo Basin) and West African. 5 The first reports of humans becoming infected were recorded in 1970, when a smallpox-like illness was investigated in areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo thought to be free of variola. 6 7 Monkeypox is endemic in the Congo Basin and West Africa, where outbreaks involving 23 to 88 people have been described. 8 9 Several animal species are susceptible to the infection, and animal to human transmission through handling and ingesting wild game animals has been identified as the primary route of infection in African outbreaks, followed by human to human transmission through close contact with infected individuals. 10 Spread of respiratory droplets and direct contact with skin lesions and scabs have been described as the predominant routes of transmission between humans, but transmission can also occur via fomites. 11 In 2003, the first monkeypox outbreak in the Western hemisphere was reported in 11 people in the United States who had been in close contact with infected prairie dogs. These animals had been transported alongside a Giant Gambian rat, presumed to be the primary source of the infection. 12 Since 2018, travel associated monkeypox infection has been diagnosed in four people in the UK, with onward transmission to three further people. 13 Sporadic cases of imported infections have also been reported in the US, Singapore, and Israel. 14\n\nOn 6 May 2022, the UK High Consequence Infectious Diseases (HCID) network was alerted to an individual with monkeypox who had recently returned from West Africa. Six further infected individuals were identified the following week, without epidemiological linkage to West Africa. As of 12 July, 1735 people had been identified with monkeypox in the UK, most (96%) occurring in gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men, and 79% occurring in London. 1 2 People with monkeypox infection have also been reported in several other non-endemic countries in Europe and the Americas, with the highest reported case loads outside of the UK in Spain and Germany. 3\n\nThe research question for this study was formed through discussions with patients. Although there was no further direct patient or public involvement in this paper owing to limited resources, we have asked members of the public to read our manuscript after submission and also plan to disseminate key messages through social media and conferences.\n\nWe calculated means and medians for continuous data, and percentages for nominal data. The Clopper-Pearson exact method was used to calculate confidence intervals for symptom prevalence. Kaplan Meier for length of stay analysis was calculated using Graphpad Prism version 9.3.1. All other analysis was calculated using Microsoft Excel version 16.62.\n\nClinical data were collected through one of three electronic healthcare systems: Electronic Patient Record iSOFT Clinical Manager 1.6 (iSOFT Group, Falls Church, VA), eNoting Client (an in-house patient records system), and preView (IMS MAXIMS, Milton Keynes, UK). Data were collected on personal characteristics, signs and symptoms reported at presentation, mucocutaneous manifestations (description, number, characteristics, and locations), risk factors as defined by the UK Health Security Agency (travel, contacts, and sexual history), HIV status, and sexual health screen results. Typical lesions were defined as macules, papules, vesicles, pustules, umbilication, crust, or scab.\n\nAll people tested for monkeypox virus between 13 May and 1 July 2022 were identified through routine tracking of samples sent from the centre\u2019s virology laboratory to the Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory. Those who tested positive were included for further study.\n\nWe conducted a retrospective observational analysis of people with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed monkeypox virus, who were tested and managed through a south London HCID centre. The centre is one of five HCID centres in the UK and serves an inner city central and south London population. Swabs for diagnostic sampling were taken from the lesions at affiliated community sexual health and HIV medicine services, on admission to hospital (inpatient ward or emergency department) or on transfer of patients with suspected monkeypox from neighbouring NHS trusts (see supplementary figure 1). Samples were processed at the Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory at Porton Down, UK. 21 People with suspected and confirmed monkeypox infection were risk stratified according to disease severity, immune status, and their ability to self-isolate, and managed accordingly. As part of routine clinical care, individuals were clinically assessed before testing. All people with a positive PCR test result for monkeypox virus took part in a telephone consultation to be counselled about their result and to conduct a risk assessment.\n\nOf the 98/295 people who tested negative for monkeypox virus by PCR, the most common clinical presentations were rash (n=46, 47.0%), oral or genital ulcers (n=16, 16.3%), and pustules (n=24, 24.5%). Other presentations included rectal symptoms (n=8, 8.2%), sore throat (n=2, 2.0%), fever (n=1, 1.0%), and hidradenitis suppurativa (n=1, 1.0%).\n\nMedian length of stay for discharged participants was 8 days (interquartile range 3.5 to 10 days) (see supplementary figure 3). One participant remains in hospital, and one additional patient was transferred to a different hospital for capacity reasons.\n\nNo participants required organ support or died. One participant required patient controlled analgesia with fentanyl for severe rectal pain. Five participants had substantial proctitis confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), one participant with rectal pain developed a rectal perforation that was managed conservatively, and one patient developed necrotising secondary bacterial infection. Participants with rectal pain were treated with oral and topical analgesia (paracetamol, ibuprofen, opioids, and lidocaine gel); rectal suppositories containing emollient, mesalazine, or steroid; and oral laxatives. To date no adverse events associated with these treatments have been observed.\n\nThe most common clinical reasons for admission were perianal or rectal pain (8/20 participants) and penile swelling (5/20). Three participants had perianal or groin abscesses. Two participants had tonsillar abscesses. Two participants required ophthalmology review owing to eye involvement. Urinary retention, superimposed bacterial lower respiratory tract infection, and disseminated lesions in the context of immunocompromise occurred in one patient each. Of 20 participants admitted to hospital for clinical reasons, 15 (75.0%) had HIV co-infection. Three (15.0%) of the admitted participants were considered to have immunosuppression due to either HIV or immunosuppressive treatment.\n\nTwenty five (12.7%) participants were admitted to hospital, of whom 20 (10.2% of the total cohort) were admitted for clinical reasons. The remainder were admitted for containment as they were unable to effectively self-isolate at home.\n\nOf those tested for concomitant sexually transmitted infections, 34 (21.1%) tested positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 18 (11.2%) for Chlamydia trachomatis, 11 (7.0%) for herpes simplex virus 1 or 2, and 6 (3.7%) for Treponema pallidum ( table 4 ). Overall, 56/178 (31.5%) participants had a concomitant sexually transmitted infection, and 12 of these cases had more than one simultaneous sexually transmitted infection. Nineteen participants were not screened for any sexually transmitted infection at initial review.\n\nSeventy of the 197 (35.5%) participants had HIV-1 co-infection (n=2 unknown). Sixty four (91.4%) of these participants were receiving antiretroviral therapy (n=4 unknown) ( table 3 ). Fifty five (78.6%) had an undetectable HIV-1 viral load (<200 copies/mL) (n=13 unknown). The median CD4 count was 664 cells/\u03bcL (interquartile range 522-894 cells/\u03bcL) (n=40 unknown).\n\nFifty four (27.4%) participants had a history of travel abroad within four weeks before symptom onset. Most common destinations were within western Europe: Spain (20), France (8), Belgium (4), Germany (4), and Greece (4). One participant had returned from an endemic area (West Africa).\n\nForty one of 155 (26.5%) participants reported known close contact with someone who showed symptoms of or had confirmed monkeypox infection (n=42 not recorded).\n\nOf the 197 participants, 196 (99.5%) identified as gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men.\n\nNotably, 71 (36.0%, 29.3% to 43.2%) participants reported rectal pain or pain on defecation, 33 (16.8%, 11.8% to 22.7%) sore throat, and 31 (15.7%, 11.0% to 21.6%) penile oedema. Overall, 31/111 (27.9%, 19.8% to 37.2%) participants with genital lesions had penile oedema and 60/82 (73.2%, 62.2% to 82.4%) participants with perianal lesions had rectal pain.\n\nSystemic illness was reported by 170 (86.3%) participants. The most commonly described systemic symptoms were fever (n=122, 61.9%, 54.8% to 68.7%), lymphadenopathy (n=114, 57.9%, 50.6% to 64.9%), and myalgia (n=62, 31.5%, 25.1% to 38.5%) ( table 2 ). In contrast with existing case reports suggesting that prodromal systemic symptoms precede skin lesions, we observed a variable temporal association between mucocutaneous and systemic features. In 102/166 (61.5%, 53.6% to 68.9%) participants, symptoms developed before the onset of mucocutaneous manifestation and in 64 (38.5%, 31.1% to 46.4%) after (n=4, unknown). Twenty seven participants (13.7%, 9.2% to 19.3%) presented with mucocutaneous manifestations without systemic symptoms.\n\nThe median number of lesions at presentation was 5 (interquartile range 3-11). Eight (4.1%) participants had more than 100 lesions. A numerical count of lesions was not documented for 29 participants. Twenty two (11.2%, 7.1% to 16.4%) participants presented with a solitary lesion: 12 involved the genitals and seven the perianal area. Twenty seven (13.7%, 9.2% to 19.3%) participants described mucocutaneous manifestations as being pruritic and 27 (13.7%, 9.2% to 19.3%) reported a concomitant widespread maculopapular rash.\n\nAll 197 participants (100%, 95% confidence interval 97.8% to 100%) presented with mucocutaneous manifestations. These had a range of documented descriptions (see supplementary figure 2) and not all lesions progressed through the traditionally recognised evolution of macule to papule to vesicle to pustule to scab. Lesions were most commonly found on the genitals (n=111, 56.4%, 49.1% to 63.4%) and anus or perianal area (n=82, 41.6%, 34.7% to 48.8%). Genital lesions or perianal lesions, or both, occurred in 174 participants (88.3%, 83.0% to 92.4%) ( table 1 ).\n\nOf 295 people tested for monkeypox virus by PCR between 13 May and 1 July 2022, 197 (66.8%) tested positive. Overall, 155 (78.7%) of the participants presented via affiliated sexual health and HIV medicine services, 24 (12.2%) via an emergency department, and 18 (9.1%) after acute admission to a ward.\n\nNovel presentations\n\nWe describe presentations of monkeypox infection in the participants that are not commonly reported. Some symptoms were severe and required hospital admission. Images represent both a range of presentations and a series of progression, giving an insight into the clinical course of the disease in an outbreak largely centred on gay, bisexual, and other men and men who have sex with men.\n\nPenile oedema Of the 31 participants who reported penile oedema, five had documented paraphimosis or phimosis. One participant, a 34-year-old circumcised man, presented with multiple penile lesions with clinically significant associated oedema. He had a history of Crohn\u2019s disease and was receiving adalimumab. He initially described multiple small, vesicular lesions on the penile shaft, coronal sulcus, and scrotum, which enlarged over the next two days, becoming umbilicated, flesh coloured papules (fig 1). The lesions then became more indurated, and the patient developed fever and cervical lymphadenopathy. On day 5 of symptoms, he developed erythema and swelling that extended from the mid-penile shaft to the glans. Overnight the swelling progressed rapidly, and the patient was admitted to hospital for assessment. Fig 1 Progression of penile lesions and penile oedema On examination, 14 large, umbilicated lesions were identified along the penile shaft, coronal sulcus, and scrotum. There was associated subcutaneous oedema with no evidence of necrosis, and the skin was not tense or painful. Single pustular lesions on the participant\u2019s arm, back, and hip were also noted, along with inguinal lymphadenopathy. He was able to urinate. Results of a Treponema pallidum particle assay and rectal swab for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis nucleic acid amplification tests were negative, respectively. The urology team advised conservative management with cold compression and massage, and analgesia including topical lidocaine gel, ibuprofen, and oral morphine sulphate. Over the next 48 hours the swelling remained unchanged, with bruising extending from the glans towards the penile base. The swelling subsequently subsided gradually, and the patient was discharged on day 13. By day 16 the swelling had largely resolved, and the penile lesions had crusted over.\n\nSecondary bacterial infection One participant, a 47-year-old man with a history of HIV (viral load <200 copies/mL on antiretroviral therapy, CD4 count 755 cells/\u03bcL), was referred for review with extensive genital lesions, penile swelling, and purulent penile discharge. He attended the emergency department when he first noticed spreading vesicles on his scrotum. A swab taken from the lesion confirmed monkeypox virus. The patient re-presented to the emergency department with progressive scrotal swelling, pain, and worsening penile ulceration and was subsequently admitted to hospital. On examination, extensive purulent lesions were identified on the penis and scrotum, with surrounding oedema (fig 2, also see supplementary figure 4). Vesicles were also noted on the arms and torso. No pain was elicited during digital rectal examination. Although there was no urinary retention or dysuria, the patient was catheterised because of concerns about increasing swelling of the penis. He was treated with co-amoxiclav to cover for a superadded bacterial infection but was switched to meropenem and clindamycin because of clinical suspicion of Fournier\u2019s gangrene. A swab sample taken from the penis grew Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. Lesions were negative for herpes simplex virus. A computed tomography scan showed extensive penile ulceration, a large hydrocele, and fluid within the scrotum. There was no collection or gas within soft tissue. The participant remains an inpatient at the time of writing. Fig 2 Secondary bacterial infection of penis due to Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. Also see supplementary figure 4\n\nRectal perforation Overall, 71 (36.0%) participants reported rectal pain or pain on defecation, and this was a common reason for admission (n=8). Five participants had proctitis confirmed on MRI, with one having a perforated rectum and one a perianal abscess. One participant, a 46-year-old man with a history of HIV (viral load <200 copies/mL on antiretroviral therapy, CD4 count 1200 cells/\u03bcL), presented with severe rectal pain. Symptoms started with fever, sore throat, and fatigue, followed by severe rectal pain. He was seen in the sexual health service, started on empirical doxycycline for proctitis, and tested for monkeypox virus. Over the next two days the patient developed a papular rash on his upper arms and trunk. A week after symptom onset, the rectal pain became so severe the patient required admission to hospital for pain control. On examination, a papular rash with white exudates was identified in the oral cavity, along with right sided cervical lymphadenopathy. A cluster of tender, white perianal papules were located at the 3 o\u2019clock position. Digital rectal examination elicited noticeable tenderness in the rectum and anal canal. The patient had ongoing fevers and continued to develop new skin lesions. He was started on tecovirimat 600 mg twice daily for 14 days. Results were negative for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis (triple site (throat, rectal, and urethral) sampling). No evidence of concomitant T pallidum infection was found. MRI on day 12 of symptoms showed active proctitis with evidence of a localised lower rectal wall perforation and associated collection (fig 3). The patient was treated conservatively with intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole. Fig 3 T2 weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan of pelvis showing a 3.5 cm cavity in left mesorectum, adjacent to the rectal wall representing an area of localised perforation (arrow)\n\nSolitary lesion In total, 22 (11.2%) participants presented with a solitary cutaneous lesion. One participant, a 53-year-old man with a history of HIV (viral load <200 copies/mL on antiretroviral therapy), presented with a single skin lesion on his thigh. Initially this was a small papule on the medial right thigh but developed into a painful mass with surrounding erythema. After review by a general practitioner, the patient started flucloxacillin, but with no benefit. He presented to the emergency department because the lesion had increased in size. He had no associated fever or other systemic symptoms. On examination a 4\u00d72 cm, tender area of induration with a central area of crusting was noted, along with bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy (fig 4). The patient was admitted to hospital for treatment with intravenous antibiotics and further investigation. Ultrasound imaging showed inflamed subcutaneous tissues within the upper right thigh, with a tract to a further lesion in the upper right outer thigh, and reactive groin lymph nodes (see supplementary figure 5). Samples were negative for Leishmania, Rickettsiae, and T pallidum, and for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis (triple site (throat, rectal, and urethral) sampling). The patient was discharged with oral co-amoxiclav. However, because of ongoing symptoms and the increase of monkeypox infection in the UK, he was reassessed and tested for monkeypox virus, with a positive result 13 days after symptom onset. How the patient became infected is unclear and there was no known sexual or other exposure to the virus. The patient was reviewed on day 18 by virtual consultation, at which time the crust on the thigh lesion had fallen off. Fig 4 Development of solitary lesion on right upper inner thigh, tracking laterally to outer thigh. Also see supplementary figure 5\n\nPolymorphic lesions Seventy (35.5%) participants had cutaneous manifestations at different stages of evolution at a single time point documented in the clinical notes. One participant, a 48-year-old man, presented with polymorphic skin lesions having first noticed a single erosion on his scrotum, which spread to the penile base and foreskin. On day 3 he developed pustular lesions with an erythematous base on his arms, behind his knee, below his ear, and on the bridge of his nose (fig 5). He attended the sexual health service and emergency department with ulcerated genital lesions and was treated with flucloxacillin. On day 5 he developed systemic symptoms, including fever, myalgia, back pain, headaches, and lethargy. By day 17 the genital lesions had crusted over; however, the patient developed new pustular lesions on his hands. By day 24, the lesions on the hands, legs, and face had crusted over. The previously crusted scrotal and penile lesions became ulcerated, and the patient was treated with co-amoxiclav for a suspected secondary bacterial infection. A swab grew Streptococcus pyogenes. Screening results were negative for herpes simplex virus, T pallidum, N gonorrhoeae, and C trachomatis. Fig 5 Cutaneous lesions on the nose, hand, and penis over time. On day 17 there were fresh pustular lesions on the hand, a partly scabbed lesion on the face, and fully scabbed lesions on the penis\n\nMaculopapular rash Twenty seven (13.7%) participants reported an erythematous maculopapular rash of varying distribution and rapid onset, separate to areas of blistering or pustules. One of these participants had positive syphilis serology (n=4 unknown). One participant, a 36-year-old man with a history of HIV (viral load <200 copies/mL on antiretroviral therapy, CD4 count >400 cells/\u03bcL), reported a rapidly progressive maculopapular rash soon after developing perianal vesicles. The vesicles initially progressed into three pruritic, pustular, perianal lesions. On day 4 the patient presented to the sexual health service with rectal pain, tenesmus, rectal bleeding, and difficulty defecating. He was treated empirically for proctitis with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily and aciclovir 400 mg three times daily. On day 6 the patient awoke to a widespread symmetrical, pruritic maculopapular rash across his torso, back, legs, and buttocks, and reported inguinal lymphadenopathy (fig 6; also see supplementary figure 6). He denied any fever or systemic features. Results for herpes simplex virus, N gonorrhoeae, and C trachomatis (3 in 1 sampling) and T pallidum were negative. By day 8 the perianal lesions had begun to crust over, tenesmus had improved, and the rash had started to diminish. Fig 6 Symmetrical maculopapular rash of the torso, back, and buttocks. Also see supplementary figure 6\n\nOropharyngeal manifestations Twenty seven (13.7%) participants had oropharyngeal lesions and nine (4.6%) had tonsillar erythema, pustules, oedema, or abscess. One participant, a 25-year-old man, presented with a right sided tonsillar abscess. He described developing right sided neck pain, quickly followed by an erythematous, pruritic rash over his trunk. He subsequently developed fever, progressively worsening right submandibular swelling, and pain, and he reported fatigue. The swelling increased, resulting in dysphagia and difficulty breathing. The patient was referred to his local ear, nose, and throat centre where a right tonsillar abscess was observed. A single papule was noted on the patient\u2019s right forearm. A swab taken from the papule tested positive for monkeypox virus, and the patient was transferred to the high consequence infectious diseases ward. On examination he had a widespread symmetrical erythematous maculopapular rash over his chest (sparing the midline), back, and upper arms, with areas of confluent erythema (fig 7). Smaller areas of a petechial rash were also noted. The right tonsil was enlarged, with an overlying pustular lesion and yellow-green exudate, with associated right cervical lymphadenopathy (fig 7). A small, crusted lesion was evident on each antecubital fossa. The patient had no genital or anal lesions. He was treated with benzylpenicillin and metronidazole. Tonsillar and skin swabs tested positive for monkeypox virus by PCR. Over the course of hospital admission, the rash subsided and the dysphagia improved. Two repeat throat swabs tested positive for monkeypox virus by PCR. Results for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis were negative. Additionally, test results for blood cultures, respiratory viral screen, herpes simplex virus, and varicella zoster virus PCR, and HIV, Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and mumps IgM were all negative. Fig 7 (Left) Symmetrical erythematous maculopapular rash on back and upper arms, with areas of confluent erythema. (Right) Right tonsillar enlargement with an overlying pustular lesion and yellow-green exudate with slight deviation of the uvula\n\nAbscesses Two participants had soft tissue abscesses identified on ultrasound examination. One of these participants, a 45-year-old man with a history of HIV (viral load <200 copies/mL on antiretroviral therapy), presented with a left sided groin abscess 10 days after he had shaved the area. The patient attended the emergency department for a left inguinal swelling, which had enlarged over three days, and the patient had associated fever and headache. The swelling had an overlying pustule, which the patient had described as an ingrown hair follicle. On examination, the swelling, measuring 6\u00d78 cm, was incised and drained by the surgical team. The next evening the patient developed papules and pustules over the mons pubis and face, followed by his neck, wrists, and back (eight lesions in total). Test results for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis (triple site (throat, rectal, and urethral) sampling) were negative. About five days later all the lesions had crusted over.",

These limitations complicated efforts to assess the true risk of severe disease and mortality associated with omicron infection.\n\nThe linked retrospective cohort study by Ward and colleagues (doi:10.1136/bmj-2022-070695) takes a further step towards addressing this question. The study reported new evidence that mortality rates were lower for infections with the omicron BA.1 subvariant than for the delta variant of concern, even after controlling for patient demographics, previous infection, and vaccination status.\n\nThe study team used the United Kingdom\u2019s Office for National Statistics Public Health Data Asset to access census data, mortality records, vaccination dates, and other standardised measures for over one million UK adults who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in December 2021 when omicron and delta were circulating. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction test results were mined for spike gene target failure, with specimens failing to amplify the S gene classified as BA.1 compatible. Although less reliable than whole genome sequencing, this technique can distinguish delta from BA.1 by detecting the deletion at positions 69 and 70 of the spike gene characteristic of BA.1 (present in almost 95% of BA.1 lineage sequences v 0.2% of delta).5 Death certification records definitively identified over 350 covid-19 related deaths in the cohort. Ultimately, the risk of covid-19 related death was found to be 66% lower in people infected with omicron than in those with delta, similar to the 69% lower risk reported by Nyberg and colleagues.4\n\nThis study provides the most conclusive evidence to date that infection with the omicron subvariant BA.1 was inherently less deadly than delta when controlling for a number of key covariates. Combining death certification records with molecular surveillance is the main advantage of this study, which avoids previous biases in covid-19 death designations. Accounting for a broad array of standardised covariates, including sociodemographic variables, pre-existing health conditions, and previous immunity, is another strength.\n\nSimilar to previous reports, risk of covid-19 death with omicron decreased in unvaccinated and vaccinated populations. Although the reduction was more pronounced in unvaccinated and boosted populations relative to the double vaccinated, this is likely skewed by the very low mortality rate among vaccinated people and the fact that booster shots were prioritised for at-risk populations during the study period.\n\nThe study also has some limitations that curtail its generalisability. Despite the strengths of the Public Health Data Asset, data collection is limited to adults in the UK and might not reflect observations in other countries or in children. A reliance on hospital system data likewise could skew cohort characteristics due to possible biases in the population captured by these data. Finally, as previously noted, the use of spike gene target failure as a proxy for variant identification carries some risk of misclassification.\n\nWhile consensus is forming that omicron infections are associated with lower mortality rates (including preliminary data on BA.4 and BA.5), several considerations remain. Firstly, it is still unclear why the risk of death is lower. Is this due to omicron\u2019s increased capacity to avoid immune recall67 leading to lower immune activation, altered viral tropism,89 changes in anatomical localisation,10 improvements in clinical care, or a combination of these and other factors? Understanding the causes is critical for assessing risks as variants continue to emerge.\n\nSecondly, a broader discussion on optimal strategies for communicating risk and implementing appropriate public health responses is necessary. Early reports suggesting lower mortality in people with omicron infections11 were widely broadcast with limited emphasis on the underlying uncertainty. While these early observations are ultimately being corroborated, effective communication will be essential for individual risk assessments and broader public health responses as the pandemic continues to evolve.\n\nFinally, it is essential to continue to develop, optimise, and deploy systems that integrate molecular surveillance, demographic, epidemiological, and clinical datasets to enable timely research. Investment in this infrastructure will be critical for the continued response to covid-19 and for future pandemic preparedness.\n\nFootnotes Competing interests: The BMJ has judged that there are no disqualifying financial ties to commercial companies.

We are barely 100 days into yet another global crisis, with dire public health warnings that it is already too late to contain monkeypox, which could become endemic in regions outside central and west Africa. Yet, if governments, in coordination with WHO, urgently took three critical sets of actions, we could prevent this. We need to, firstly, fill key knowledge gaps to stem transmission; secondly, anticipate how the pandemic may unfold; and, finally, move from talking about a new global public health architecture to implementing it.\n\nResearch suggests that the new monkeypox strain behaves differently than those historically found in central and western Africa.2 As of 26 July, there have been more than 19 000 confirmed cases worldwide in 2022, with more than 98% of these in 68 countries outside of the six countries where the virus has been endemic.3 According to data published on 6 July from the WHO, 99.5% of reported cases have been in men,4 and, so far, the majority of reported cases have been in communities of men who have sex with men. However, a small number of cases have been identified among transgender women, cisgender women, and children.5\n\nDiagnostics, vaccines, and treatments exist for monkeypox, but are in short supply. Higher income countries, like the United States, have been accumulating much of the world\u2019s vaccine supplies. We know far too little about the durability of protection following monkeypox infection and monkeypox vaccination, making research and analysis an important priority. As with covid-19, equitable distribution of medical resources is vital and WHO should launch an effective mechanism for fair allocation. Funding and guidance are also needed on educating clinicians and patients, facilitating testing, and prioritising vaccines.\n\nWe cannot truly know the course that this outbreak will take, but the absence of detailed modelling is hindering public health strategies and planning. At present, the outbreak is concentrated in Europe and increasingly North America. While imperfect, these regions often have more civil and legal protections for men who have sex with men and transgender people than other parts of the world. As we predict growth in cases in the Middle East and north African countries, and in Brazil, Hungary, and other countries where men who have sex with men and transgender people are stigmatised or criminalised, how can we focus the response on those currently most affected without fueling stigma and harming communities at elevated risk of monkeypox?

        "Elisabeth Mahase The BMJ\n\nOne in eight covid-19 patients (12.7%) is likely to experience long term symptoms, a study from the Netherlands has reported.1\n\nUsing digital questionnaires, researchers collected data on the frequency of 23 symptoms commonly associated with covid in an uninfected population and in people who had had a covid diagnosis.\n\nThe findings, published in the Lancet,1 found that 21.4% (381/1782) of adults who had had covid experienced at least one new or severely increased symptom three to five months after infection when compared with before.

        "Introduction Seven coronaviruses can infect humans, all belonging to the alpha or beta subgroups, including 229E (alpha), NL63 (alpha), OC43 (beta), and HKU1 (beta).1 Over the past two decades, three notable beta coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2011; and most recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019) have emerged and caused severe illness, resulting in debilitating disease and worldwide deaths. SARS-CoV-2 is the pathogen responsible for the current coronavirus 2019 (covid-19) pandemic and has caused more than 5.59 million deaths in around two years and resulted in multisystem illness in several million people.2 All viruses change and mutate over time, with most changes having little to no impact. However, some mutations could alter its pathogenic or transmission potential and might, therefore, increase disease severity or hinder the effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutic strategies. The World Health Organization3 classifies variants of concern as SARS-CoV-2 variants that increase transmissibility, disease severity, or virulence or that decrease the effectiveness of public health measures, diagnostics, therapeutics, or vaccines. Variants of interest are variants with genetic changes predicted to enhance the virulence and transmissibility of the virus, which have been identified to cause community transmission in multiple countries and pose a possible risk to global public health. Lastly, variants under monitoring are those with genetic changes are suspected to affect virus characteristics and have currently unclear phenotypic or epidemiological effects. Variants under monitoring are not typically assigned a name until they are upgraded to variants of interest or concern. The full working definitions of variants of concern, variants of interest, and variants under monitoring can be found on the WHO website for tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants (www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/).3 As of 25 January 2022, WHO reports five variants of concern (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and omicron), two variants of interest (lambda and mu), and three variants under monitoring.3 Former variants of concern, variants of interest, or variants under monitoring have been reclassified as \"formerly monitored variants,\" owing to these variants no longer circulating, having little impact on the epidemiological situation, or having no concerning properties.3 Since the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic, the rapid development of effective covid-19 vaccines has taken place around the world. As of 24 January 2022, 33 vaccines have been approved for use in 197 countries, with 10 vaccines having gained emergency use listing approval from WHO.4 In this review, we provide an overview of the genome and structure of SARS-CoV-2, describing how these elements allow the virus to infect and replicate inside of host cells, before outlining how certain mutations harboured by SARS-CoV-2 variants enhance these abilities. Next, we examine the current state of vaccine development around the world and provide evidence of the effectiveness of booster doses.\n\nSources and selection criteria We searched PubMed and Embase databases for covid-19 related articles published between 1 January 2020 and 25 January 2022 and for general coronavirus related articles published from 1 January 2000 onwards. Our search terms included SARS-CoV-2, covid-19, and specific terms including virology, genome, variants, and vaccine. Additional, specific search terms are outlined in online supplemental file 1. We performed further manual searching for additional articles and data using relevant databases, including who.int, gov.uk, and ecdc.europa.eu/en. Owing to the rapidly evolving nature of the literature involving SARS-CoV-2, we also searched preprint databases including MedRxiv and BioRxiv. We selected studies through different criteria (online supplemental file 1), owing to the various topics discussed here. Overall, studies were selected on the basis of quality and impact factor of publishing journal, with real world studies with large sample sizes of the greatest interest. Supplemental material [bmjmed-2021-000040supp001.pdf]\n\nViral transmission, clinical presentation, and genetic susceptibility of covid-19 SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly spread via respiratory droplet transmission, spreading between people through close contact, coughing, or sneezing. The virus can also spread through airborne transmission, fomite transmission, and via other modes, such as through biological material including urine and faeces.5 6 The SARS-CoV-2 virus can survive on surfaces or survive suspended in air droplets for long periods. Indeed, on plastic, stainless steel, and glass surfaces, the half life of the virus is around 5.3, 4.4, and 4.2 hours, respectively,7 with no difference seen between SARS-CoV-2 variants.8 Although SARS-CoV-2 can be detected on inanimate surfaces for hours and days, owing to the evaporation of water droplets (the viruses\u2019 living environment), the concentration of the virus plummets rapidly.9 Protective measures, including use of personal protective equipment, maintenance of indoor ventilation, and disinfection hands and surfaces, can effectively limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2.10 Once inside the airways, SARS-CoV-2 can infect ciliated, mucus secreting, and club cells of bronchial epithelium, type 1 pneumocytes within the lungs, and the conjunctival mucosa.11 The clinical presentation of covid-19 is non-specific and heterogeneous, and infection can result in a wide spectrum of symptoms. After an incubation period of 4-14 days, symptoms range from mild to severe disease and, in some instances, can result in death.12 The most common covid-19 symptoms include fever, cough, dyspnoea, and fatigue,13 14 while myalgia, gastrointestinal issues, cognitive deficits, and other symptoms are reported. Asymptomatic individuals can also test positive for covid-19.15 16 Although the entire population is susceptible to covid-19 infection, some subgroups within the general population are more susceptible to developing poorer clinical outcomes. Risk factors associated with increased probability of hospital admission, severe disease, and fatal outcome with covid-19 have been identified. Older age17\u201319; male sex20 21; belonging to an ethnic minority group21 22; and comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, and lung disease,18 23\u201325 malignancy, and immunodeficiency26\u201328 have all been associated with more severe covid-19. The duration and treatment of covid-19 symptoms will also have profound influences on the severity of disease and the acute and long term outcomes after recovery. The host genetic background is thought to have an influence on the susceptibility and severity of covid-19, possibly explaining the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations that can develop in seemingly similar individuals. A meta-analysis, consisting of 49,562 patients with covid-19 across numerous ancestry groups, identified four gene loci associated with susceptibility to covid-19 (SLC6A20, RPL24, ABO, PLEKHA4) and nine associated with increased risk of severe covid-19 (LZTFL1, FOXP4, TMEM65, OAS1, KANSL1, TAC4, DPP9, RAVER1, and IFNAR2).29 Meanwhile, genome wide association studies spanning across Europe, the US, and the UK identified a gene cluster on chromosome three (chr3p21.31) as being strongly linked with susceptibility and severity of covid-19.30 31 Polymorphisms in the genes of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) have also been shown to enhance SARS-CoV-2 viral entry,32 33 with differential polymorphisms seen across ethnic minority populations, which might partly explain why certain ethnic groups are more susceptible to severe covid-19. Increased ACE2 receptor levels have also been associated with other risk factors of covid-19, including smoking and increasing age.34 The use of polygenetic risk scores might be useful in determining an individual\u2019s risk for developing severe disease caused by covid-19.35 A polygenetic risk score infers a person\u2019s risk of susceptibility to, or development of, a certain disease based on the total number of genomic variations they possess. Determining polygenetic risk scores with the inclusion of comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,36 or other aspects such as coagulation factors,37 could improve the usefulness of these scores in determining a person\u2019s risk of severe covid-19.\n\nVirology of SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV-2 is a positive stranded RNA virus belonging to Coronaviridae family. Coronaviruses, which have crown-like appearances, are the largest known RNA viruses and are thought to primarily infect vertebrates.38 39 SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta genus of the coronaviruses and has a genome size varying from 29.8 to 29.9 kb.40 Human coronavirus genomes consist of a variable number of open reading frames (ORFs). Following the typical 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 order, the beginning two thirds of the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains two ORFs (ORF1a and ORF1b) that, inside the host cell, are translated at the rough endoplasmic reticulum into polyprotein 1a (pp1a) and polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab), respectively.40 These polyproteins are cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp): nsp1-11, from pp1a; and nsp12-16, from pp1ab. The proteolytic release of nsp1 occurs rapidly, which enables it to interfere with translation processes of the host cell by inducing cellular mRNA degradation.41\u201343 Nsp2-16 contain the viruses\u2019 replication and transcription complex and encode multiple enzymes with many functions, including proteases, helicase, polymerase, exonuclease and endonuclease, N7-methyltransferase and 2\u2019O-methyltransferase, and de-ubiquitination enzymes.44 45 The final third of human coronavirus genomes contain genes that encode structural and accessory proteins. The four major structural proteins encoded here are the nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelope (E), and spike glycoprotein (S) proteins.46 47 The N protein is associated with the viral RNA genome, is involved in RNA synthesis regulation, and interacts with the M protein during viral budding.39 48 The M protein is important for viral assembly, it contains a short N-terminal domain that projects onto the external surface of the envelope and a long internal C-terminal.39 The E protein function is largely unknown; however, along with the N and M proteins, it is required for viral assembly and release.47 Lastly, the S protein gives coronaviruses their characteristic spikes that compose their crownlike appearance. This protein projects through the viral envelope, is heavily glycosylated, and regulates host cell membrane receptor binding and fusion of the viral and cellular membrane.49 The functions of the 11 accessory proteins encoded within the one-third closest to the 3\u2019 end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome are not fully understood. These accessory proteins are encoded by the ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF3c, ORF3d, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF9b, ORC9c, and ORF10 genes. Some of these proteins, including ORF3b, ORF6, ORF7a, and ORF8, are interferon antagonists that impair the host cell immune response,50\u201353 whereas ORF3a might promote virus release54 and is involved in apoptosis of host cells through caspase-3 activation.55 ORF9b and ORF9c are known to suppress the host antiviral response by interacting with host cell organelles,56\u201358 whereas a clear understanding of the functions of ORF3c, ORF7b, and ORF10 remains unclear.59 Figure 1 (A,B) depicts the genome and structure of SARS-CoV-2. Figure 1 Genome and structure of SARS-CoV-2. (A) SARS-CoV-2 genome and spike (S) protein amino acid composition. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is about 30 000 base pairs (bp) long and consists of open reading frames (ORF) and elements that are essential for the virus\u2019 structure. The S protein is responsible for binding and entry into host cells. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern contain various S protein non-synonymous mutations that result in amino acid changes in the receptor binding domain (orange bracketed text) and the S1/S2 subunit interface (black bracketed text), which have been shown to enhance transmissibility of the virus. Variants of concern include alpha (\u03b1), beta (\u03b2), gamma (\u03b3), delta (\u03b4), and omicron (O). (B) SARS-CoV-2 structure. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that has a crown-like appearance and contains four major structural proteins: nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M). (C) Viral S protein and human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein directly interacts with human ACE2 receptors in order to gain entry into host cells. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein tightly binds to ACE2. (D) S protein structure. The S protein protrudes out from the main SARS-CoV-2 bulk and is comprised of two subunits: S1 and S2. S1 contains the RBD, which directly interacts with the human ACE2 receptor, while the S1/S2 interface contains a furin cleavage site that is cleaved to allow S2 to fuse with the host cell membrane. Both the RBD and the S1/S2 interface contain transmissibility increasing mutations that are harboured in variants of concern The S glycoprotein is composed of two functionally distinct subunits (S1 and S2) and is essential for viral entry into host cells. The N-terminal S1 domain of the protein contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) that directly interacts with the ACE2 receptor on the host cell, which is the primary receptor that SARS-Cov-2 uses for cell entry.60 The C-terminal S2 domain fuses the host and viral membranes to allow for entry of the viral genome into the host cell.61 The subunits of the trimeric S complex are either in a closed (pre-fusion stage) or open (post-fusion stage) conformation,62 with one subunit always in an open conformation to allow for ACE2 recognition and binding.63 The RBD itself consists of five anti-parallel \u03b2 strands surrounded by several \u03b1 helices.64 From closed to open conformation, the RBD undergoes structural rearrangement whereby the globular head region rotates clockwise, which alters is elecropotential surface.64 Once positioned, numerous residues within the RBD form either hydrogen bonds or salt bridges with residues of the ACE2 receptor, allowing for tight binding,65 while the concave structure of the RBD allows for three distinct binding regions.64 Following binding between the S protein and the host cell receptor, host cell proteases cleave the S protein, causing the release of the S2 domain which allows for fusion and cell entry.66 Figure 1 (C,D) shows the structure and function of the S protein. The ACE2 receptor is expressed in numerous cell types throughout the human body, including in the lungs, oral and nasal mucosas, heart, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, liver, spleen, and brain,67 highlighting the widespread infection that SARS-CoV-2 can inflict. Meanwhile, TMPRSS2, a host cell protease, facilitates fusion of the viral and host cell membranes,68 and could have a role in the spread of the virus in the airways.68 Host cell cathepsin L might also aid in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry by cleaving the S protein.69 Indeed, a clinically approved protease inhibitor has been shown to block SARS-CoV-2 cell entry.70 Figure 2 depicts the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into and replicates inside host cells, and summarises the host cell immune response. Figure 2 Viral entry and host response. (A) At the alveolar epithelial cell layer. Epithelial cells in the lungs express both angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), allowing for infection by SARS-CoV-2. Replication of the virus within these cells induces an intense immune response that attracts monocytes, T cells, and macrophages and, in some instances, can result in a cytokine storm. (B) Within nearby blood vessels. Cytokines produced by the epithelial cell layer are released into blood vessels supplying the infected tissue, which causes the recruitment of further immune cells to the area, driving the damaging inflammatory response further. Circulating cytokines also create a systemic inflammatory environment. (C) Adaptive immune response. Circulating lymphocytes carry viral antigens to lymph nodes and bone marrow to begin the adaptive immune system processes whereby B cells, and later antibodies, are activated. (D) SARS-CoV2 host replication. The SARS-CoV-2 virus uses the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 to gain entry into human cells. Following release of the viral RNA within the host cell, the virus uses the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus to produce and manufacture new viral particles, which are released out of the cell to infect other cells and new hosts\n\nEmerging treatments As the virus becomes better understood, the therapeutic strategy against covid-19 develops. Over 2000 ongoing trials are currently assessing certain treatment strategies for covid-19.309 Recently, antiviraldrugs including molnupiravir (Lagevrio) and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) have been approved in the UK,310 311 US,312 313 and Europe314 315 for treating covid-19 in certain risk groups. Similarly, sotrovimab (Xevudy), a monoclonal antibody treatment, has recently been approved for use in treating certain patients with covid-19 in the UK,316 US,317 and Europe.318 These drugs have been shown to be effective at preventing poor clinical outcomes, including death, in those individuals vulnerable to severe covid-19 infection. Other drug treatments, such as janus kinase inhibitors, corticosteroids, and anti-inflammatory drugs, have contrasting evidence to support their use; therefore, the use of specific drugs is either recommended for or against by certain treatment and management guidelines, which are discussed below.\n\nGuidelines The treatment and management of covid-19 is a continually evolving topic; however, health authorities have published and continue to update guidelines and recommendations for treating covid-19. The WHO living guideline on covid-19 and treatment is regularly updated, with the latest version (published on 14 January 2022) containing 14 recommendations on covid-19 treatment.319 The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence320 and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency321 provide updated guidelines on covid-19 treatment, and in Europe, the ECDC regularly publishes several guidelines providing recommendations on a range of covid-19 related topics.322 The US National Institutes of Health323 and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention324 provide guidance on covid-19 treatment and management, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention supplying guidelines for specific groups such as employers, schools, health departments, and governments.\n\nConsiderations for the future Novel infectious diseases and pandemics are an unpredictable but inevitable aspect of nature; therefore, we should learn from past pandemics to prepare for future ones. Firstly, the covid-19 pandemic has highlighted and amplified the existing inequalities within society,325 with Black ethnicity, social disadvantage, and unemployment being risk factors for covid-19 infection326 and those groups most economically deprived found to be particularly vulnerable.327 These inequalities need resolving in order for us to be better prepared for similar situations in the future. Next, to progress through a pandemic we should be racing against the pathogen, and not against each other. This statement becomes apparent when considering the problems faced by countries seeking out personal protective equipment,328 and the vaccine inequity seen worldwide,329 with developed countries often better placed to be able to purchase these items. Initiatives such as WHO\u2019s COVAX programme are vital to protect the most vulnerable groups and reduce the global spread of disease. In October 2021, the UK government released a publication outlining where the policies implemented to reduce the impact of the covid-19 pandemic failed, and the lessons learnt from these failures.330 The publication then presents conclusions and recommendations on how to enhance pandemic preparedness, lockdown and social distancing measures, testing and contact tracing, social care, and vaccines. In countries such as the UK, US, and much of Europe, where the covid-19 death rate has been high, steps need to be taken and lessons need to be learnt in order to be better prepared for the next pandemic. The responsibility of improving pandemic response lies with policy makers, the medical/scientific community, and the public, and will ultimately require a collaborative approach. However, certain aspects of the response to the covid-19 pandemic have been a triumph. One major victory was the rapid development and rollout of vaccines,331 which continue to be effective. The rollout of rapid testing and quarantine for infected individuals was also important to at least disrupt the spread of the virus, especially given that asymptomatic individuals can contribute to the spread. Furthermore, the swift identification and sharing of knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 variants between countries should be applauded. Lessons can be learnt from countries where covid-19 was controlled. In Taiwan, authorities managing the pandemic as directed by pre-covid-19 pandemic plans prompted an immediate response. Screening of all airline passengers arriving from Wuhan and high risk areas, restricting entry for non-Taiwanese citizens, 14 day quarantine periods for contacts of people with confirmed covid-19 or returning travellers, a ban on large gatherings, and widespread mask wearing were some of the quickly implemented management strategies.332 New Zealand implemented similarly effective restrictions, with the addition of a national lockdown.332 Many of the pandemic control components that kept infection and death numbers low in Taiwan and New Zealand could be adopted by other countries in the future and could lead to improved outcomes in terms of protecting the health of individuals and the health and wellbeing of the country. Overall, much can be learnt from the covid-19 pandemic and, as we emerge from it, the inspection of which policies failed and which succeeded is imperative.\n\nConclusion Covid-19 remains prevalent and life threatening. Although the rollout of vaccines has been successful, attaining a high global vaccination coverage and ensuring that all healthcare systems have the capacity to cope with seasonal waves are essential. With the omicron variant highly prevalent, we must continue to learn, develop therapeutics, and remain vigilant to new variants of concern. Here, we have provided an overview of the virology of SARS-CoV-2, including the mutations harboured by variants of the virus and how these mutations effect its transmissibility and virulence. We have also discussed the vaccines that have been developed and used around the world and have provided evidence supporting the rollout of booster doses. Future priorities should focus on continuing vaccination programmes and developing variant specific vaccines as new mutations emerge. This strategy, along with the expansion of our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and which treatments are most successful to treat covid-19 infections will ultimately lead to favourable outcomes.

        "Conclusion Increased risks of haematological and vascular events that led to hospital admission or death were observed for short time intervals after first doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines. The risks of most of these events were substantially higher and more prolonged after SARS-CoV-2 infection than after vaccination in the same population.\n\nResults The study found increased risk of thrombocytopenia after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (incidence rate ratio 1.33, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 1.47 at 8-14 days) and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (5.27, 4.34 to 6.40 at 8-14 days); increased risk of venous thromboembolism after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (1.10, 1.02 to 1.18 at 8-14 days) and after SARS-CoV-2 infection (13.86, 12.76 to 15.05 at 8-14 days); and increased risk of arterial thromboembolism after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination (1.06, 1.01 to 1.10 at 15-21 days) and after SARS-CoV-2 infection (2.02, 1.82 to 2.24 at 15-21 days). Secondary analyses found increased risk of CVST after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (4.01, 2.08 to 7.71 at 8-14 days), after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination (3.58, 1.39 to 9.27 at 15-21 days), and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test; increased risk of ischaemic stroke after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination (1.12, 1.04 to 1.20 at 15-21 days) and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test; and increased risk of other rare arterial thrombotic events after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (1.21, 1.02 to 1.43 at 8-14 days) and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.\n\nMain outcome measures The primary outcomes were hospital admission or death associated with thrombocytopenia, venous thromboembolism, and arterial thromboembolism within 28 days of three exposures: first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine; first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine; and a SARS-CoV-2 positive test. Secondary outcomes were subsets of the primary outcomes: cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and other rare arterial thrombotic events.\n\nParticipants 29 121 633 people were vaccinated with first doses (19 608 008 with Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and 9 513 625 with Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2 mRNA)) and 1 758 095 people had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. People aged \u226516 years who had first doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines and any outcome of interest were included in the study.\n\nWe evaluated the short term risks of thrombocytopenia, venous thromboembolism, and arterial thromboembolism associated with the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 vaccines, or a SARS-CoV-2 positive test in England between 1 December 2020 and 24 April 2021. We also evaluated the risk of prespecified secondary outcomes of interest, namely CVST, ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and other rare arterial thrombotic events according to a prespecified protocol. 15\n\nThe situation is further complicated by evidence on the associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection and thromboses. 4 A US study estimated that the risk of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is approximately seven times greater than that associated with the BNT162b2 mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) covid-19 vaccines. 13 Direct comparisons between these vaccines and the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine were not possible because the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine is not used in the US. Evaluation of the safety of new vaccines relies on case reports or series, and analyses of large scale health data. While informative, case reports are limited by small numbers, and potential selection, recall, and recording biases. In contrast, routinely collected electronic health data contain recording of the exposure, outcomes, and confounders, and provide a rich source of data to enable the robust evaluation of rare vaccine safety events. 14\n\nRecently, thrombocytopenia and rare thromboembolic events after the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccine have been reported in Denmark, Norway, 6 7 Germany, Austria, 8 and the United Kingdom. 9 This prompted several countries to limit the use of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 on the basis that the benefits might not outweigh the risks. 8 9 10 11 The United States has reported similar events associated with the Ad26.COV2-S (recombinant) Janssen vaccine, resulting in a pause in its roll-out. 12\n\nCovid-19 vaccines have been tested in randomised clinical trials 1 2 3 that are designed to establish efficacy and safety, but insufficiently powered to detect rare adverse events. If a new vaccine has a serious adverse profile (even if the risk is rare), then a risk-benefit evaluation could lead to withdrawal of the vaccine or restrictions on its use in the interests of public safety. These risks, however, need to be balanced against the risks of covid-19 itself leading to adverse events and death. 4 Safety evaluation is particularly important when vaccine development has been accelerated, the vaccines are new, and when rapid worldwide deployment of covid-19 vaccines has occurred, with 1.43 billion doses already administered worldwide. 5\n\nMethods\n\nStudy design and period We undertook a self-controlled case series from 1 December 2020 to 24 April 2021 (the latest date for which outcome data were available) to examine the associations between ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines and thrombotic events during the ongoing covid-19 vaccination programme in England. We also investigated the association between a SARS-CoV-2 positive test and the thrombotic events of interest among the same vaccinated population. The self-controlled case series was originally developed to assess risks of adverse events to vaccination.16 The case series determines the relative incidence of the outcome of interest for exposed time periods (eg, after vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection) compared with unexposed baseline periods in people with the outcome of interest (see supplementary fig 1). Inference is within people and therefore this implicitly controls for all covariates that remain constant during the study period. We selected patients with each outcome during the study period and determined dates when they had the vaccine or tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Separate analyses were carried out for each outcome of interest.\n\nData sources We used the National Immunisation Management System register of covid-19 vaccination to identify vaccine exposure, which includes vaccine type, date, and doses for all people vaccinated in England. We linked individual level data to national data for mortality, hospital admissions, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Linkages are conducted to protect patient anonymity because the hashed ID used to link patients cannot be reversed. Vaccine and SARS-CoV-2 positive test data were available until 24 April 2021. Hospital admission data were obtained from two sources: Hospital Episode Statistics (up to 31 March 2021), which includes any admission, and Secondary Users Service (up to 24 April 2021), which includes only admissions with an outcome (death or discharge). We used the QResearch database of 12 million patients linked to the above dataset to calculate background incidence rates for each outcome before the pandemic (2015-19). QResearch includes demographic, clinical, and drug data, and is used for clinical1718 and drug safety research.1920 QResearch is one of the largest and most representative primary care research databases nationally,21 covering approximately 20% of the population of England.\n\nInclusion criteria We included all people aged \u226516 years who had first doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines and any outcome of interest. We excluded people who received the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine because of very small numbers. We used the first event in the study period and excluded patients from the analysis of each outcome if they had a hospital admission for the same event in the two years before the start of the study period.\n\nExposure Our main exposures were the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. We censored people on the earliest of the following: date of their second dose, date of death, or study end date (24 April 2021). Our secondary exposure was a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, using the first date of a positive test (not the date of reporting) as the exposure date. We defined the exposure risk intervals as the following prespecified time periods: 0, 1-7, 8-14, 15-21, and 22-28 days after each exposure date (vaccination date or date of positive SARS-CoV-2 test). Multiple risk intervals were used to differentiate between acute and non-acute phases after vaccination. The baseline period (without exposure) was defined as any time between 1 December 2020 and 29 days before the exposure date, and from 29 days after the exposure date until 24 April 2021 or the censored date if earlier. A pre-risk interval of 1-28 days before each exposure date was included to deal with possible bias that might arise if the occurrence of the outcome temporarily influenced the likelihood of exposure.22 Histograms of the data by interval between vaccination and event day are shown in supplementary figure 2a. The graphs show a drop of hospital admissions or deaths for each outcome about 28 days before vaccination, hence the choice of the pre-risk period. Hospital admissions for the event of interest are probably the trigger for the covid-19 test. Such events might be caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the reverse causality involved in their detection induces bias. To reduce the bias, which could overestimate or underestimate the effect of infection, we decided to allocate day 0 to a risk period on its own.23\n\nOutcomes Our three composite primary outcomes were hospital admission or death associated with thrombocytopenia, venous thromboembolism, and arterial thromboembolism. Our prespecified secondary outcomes were subsets of the primary outcomes: CVST, ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and other rare arterial thrombotic events. Hospital inpatient admissions from 1 December 2020 to 24 April 2021 with an ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases version 10) diagnosis code in their first 13 diagnoses fields that indicated the outcome of interest were identified in the Hospital Episode Statistics and Secondary Users Service databases. Supplementary table 1 gives a list of ICD-10 codes and groupings for each outcome. We used the earliest date of hospital admission or date of death for the relevant event as the event date. Cause of death in the UK is assessed by the medical practitioner who attended the patient during their last illness, and if not seen in the preceding 14 days, the cause is determined by a coroner based on assessment of medical evidence.\n\nStatistical analysis We described the characteristics of each cohort (patients who had been vaccinated with the outcomes of interest) in terms of age, sex, and ethnicity. The self-controlled case series models were fitted using a conditional Poisson regression model with an offset for the length of the risk period. Incidence rate ratios, the relative rate of hospital admissions or deaths due to each outcome of interest in risk periods relative to baseline periods, and their 95% confidence intervals were estimated using each model. Exposure terms for both vaccines and for infection with SARS-CoV-2 were included in the same model. To account for temporal changes in background rates, we divided the study period into weekly blocks starting on 1 December 2020 and adjusted for these changes as discrete covariates in the analysis. We used Wald tests to compare risks associated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines. We investigated whether the associations between vaccine exposures and outcomes are sex or age dependent by running the analyses in separate subgroups by sex and age group (younger or older than 50 years).\n\nSensitivity analyses We conducted six sensitivity analyses: (1) excluding those who died from the outcome; (2) restricting analysis to the period after vaccination or after a SARS-CoV-2 positive test, without censoring at death; (3) censoring at 12 weeks after vaccination; (4) censoring on 10 March 2021; (5) restricting the study period until 31 March 2021; and (6) restricting the analysis to patients who had their vaccination after 1 January 2021. The first two analyses tested the assumption that the occurrence of an outcome event did not influence the probability of subsequent exposures, such as through death.22 The third analysis tested the sensitivity to our approach of censoring patients at the time of the second dose (to avoid contamination of baseline time). The additional censoring at 12 weeks after the first dose of vaccine was used because this is the recommended time for a second dose in the UK. Concerns over CVST and blood clots were raised first in Europe around 10 March 2021, and so we censored on this date for the fourth sensitivity analysis; this allowed us to include only time unaffected by any notoriety bias (because of media attention, thrombotic events might have been more likely to be reported on death certificates or hospital admission records if healthcare professionals were aware of recent ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination). The fifth analysis tested the completeness of the data, and the sixth analysis was done to have comparable time periods and priority groups for the two vaccines.\n\nAssessing the self-controlled case series assumptions To further assess the assumptions of the self-controlled case series and our modelling choices, we visually examined the data. We plotted a histogram of the number of occurrences of an event by time before or since vaccination for each outcome to assess the possibility that a hospital admission for that event might affect subsequent vaccination (supplementary fig 2a). We plotted a histogram of the time from event to actual end of observation in patients who were censored and uncensored to assess if event dependent observation periods could be a problem for the analysis (supplementary fig 2b). Event dependent exposures\u2014supplementary figure 2a shows the number of occurrences of an event by time before or after vaccination. We observed a decrease in the 28 days immediately before vaccination, indicating that occurrence of an event might have reduced the likelihood of vaccination. This pattern is similar for most of the outcomes and for both vaccines. Therefore, we have added the pre-risk period of 28 days. Event dependent observation periods\u2014supplementary figure 2b shows the frequency of days from event to actual end of observation in censored and uncensored patients. A spike close to zero is apparent in the censored data histogram for most of the outcomes, excluding CVST. This finding indicates the presence of event dependent observation periods (censoring on death date due to outcome), which we tested further with the first and second sensitivity analyses (excluding those who died from the outcome; restricting analysis to the period after vaccination, without censoring at death). These additional analyses agreed with the main analysis, suggesting that there should be little concern about these outcomes.\n\nAbsolute measure of risk In self-controlled case series analysis, results are presented in relative terms\u2014the ratio of the incidence in the exposure risk periods relative to the incidence in control periods. We supplemented these results with measures of effect of each exposure in absolute terms using a method developed to estimate the number of exposures needed to produce one excess adverse outcome and the excess number of events per 10 million exposed for each outcome.24 These measures were computed for a period of 8-28 days after vaccination to remove the healthy vaccinee effect seen at 0-7 days after vaccination. To make numbers comparable, the same measures were computed for the same period after a SARS-CoV-2 positive test.\n\nNegative or positive controls We examined the associations of exposures with coeliac disease as a negative control outcome25 because it was not thought to be associated with exposure to vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection; and with anaphylaxis as a positive control outcome because it could occur shortly after either vaccine.26",

The term \u201clong covid\u201d was coined by patients, initially being used on social media to describe symptoms that were impairing quality of life.9 We argue that this experience generates an obligation to recognise long covid as a potentially disabling condition defined by clinical diagnostic criteria and supported by ongoing clinical research. Such recognition would also re-enforce the obligation of the state to extend and expand supportive infrastructure and policy for people with other disabilities. The need for just social policies grounded in contemporary theories of disability, designed by disabled people for disabled people, can also form the basis for advocacy and policy change beyond the pandemic.\n\nWhat is long covid? Although long covid is widely acknowledged to exist, diagnostic criteria vary, with different authorities acknowledging a diversity of symptoms and severity levels. Symptoms include fatigue, cognitive symptoms such as difficulty concentrating and impaired memory, and sensory changes like permanent loss of smell or taste.10 Physiologically, long covid may cause damage to extremities, in some cases requiring amputation1112; multiorgan injury such as chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis or transplant1314; or respiratory complications and persistent post-exertional symptoms. These symptoms may exist in isolation or in clusters, and though they range in severity, many greatly affect people\u2019s wellbeing and life plans. The exact prevalence of long covid is unknown because the wide range of presentations overlap numerous other conditions, there is no definitive diagnostic test, some people with long covid may struggle to access care (and thereby be counted), and covid-19 testing was difficult to access in many settings at the beginning of the pandemic. In the UK, the Coronavirus Infection Survey conducted from April 2020 to August 2021 estimated between 3% and 11% of 15 061 participants with covid-19 infection experienced symptoms for more than 12 weeks.15 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found up to 20% of 353 000 patients aged 18-64 years had one symptom attributable to covid-19 more than four weeks after infection.16 At its lower bound, at least 16.5 million of the 562 million people infected with covid-19 worldwide as of 20 July 202217 may have long covid, but at its higher estimates, the number could extend to over 100 million people. Symptoms of long covid can persist for over a year and potentially be permanent. One international online survey in 2020 of 3762 people in 56 countries with confirmed or suspected covid-19 who had illness lasting over 28 days found 45% of respondents had required a reduced work schedule, and another 23% had left the workforce because of suspected long covid.18 Long covid in children and young people could similarly jeopardise educational attainment.\n\nLong covid and disability Long covid itself may not be a disability but given its potentially debilitating effects on people\u2019s lives, it can be disabling. Long covid symptoms may also constitute disabilities because of loss of human function or because of a persistent impairment that undermines a person\u2019s quality of life.19 Another way in which long covid symptoms may be disabling is if a person experiences social discrimination or social subordination, wherein they lose status in society as a result of perceived \u201cdefective bodily functioning.\u201d1920 Some evidence suggests that people with long covid already experience discrimination. For example, in a cross sectional survey of 127 patients with long covid symptoms conducted between August 2020 and March 2021 in Japan, 55 people had experienced at least one form of discrimination and stigma, including being treated as if still contagious or being the subject of harmful rumours or verbal harassment.21 Subsequent research does not suggest attitudes have changed.22 People with long covid can also experience social isolation, stigma, and loss of social identity because of their inability to perform at work, maintain their relationships, care for their families, exercise, and so on.23\n\nClear diagnostic criteria facilitate care and legal recognition Long covid would be better understood as a potentially disabling condition if there were clinical diagnostic criteria to create meaningful pathways to care. This would benefit people with disabling symptoms in at least three ways. Firstly, those affected may need ongoing medical and allied care to retain or restore functions or to fulfil their life plans. Applications for state funded disability related health assistance usually require a clinical examination and sometimes a diagnostic code, such as an ICD-10 code. Diagnostic criteria for long covid may facilitate access to interventions and services that support social engagement and physical function (eg, hand rails, modified work environments, or access to rehabilitative therapy or psychiatric care). Clear diagnostic criteria\u2014supported by ongoing research into the underlying mechanisms of persistent symptoms24 \u2014might also reduce uncertainty and validate the experience of patients with long covid, including those who did not have access to testing at the time of presumed infection. A 2020 qualitative study in 24 patients with long covid identified uncertainty and being taken seriously as important concerns.25 The third and potentially more profound implication of establishing diagnostic criteria for long covid is in legal recognition of disability through instruments such as the Americans with Disabilities Act in the US and the Equality Act 2010 in the UK. Because people with long covid may experience long term, substantial impairment of their ability or autonomy to participate in society, in principle these instruments may already cover long covid. For example, the Equality Act covers discrimination on the grounds of \u201cprotected characteristics,\u201d one of which is disability, and can require employers and others to make \u201creasonable adjustments\u201d for people with disabilities. However, the widely variable presentations of long covid and absence of definitive diagnostic criteria or biomarkers may make it harder for patients to prove that they qualify as disabled. The Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act also requires people to prove qualification before they can claim a right to accommodations.26 This means that the disability must be recognised by a court rather than relying on self-reported limitations in a person\u2019s ability to undertake major life activities. Conversely, formally conceiving of long covid as a disability in law or policy is not the same as an individual determining whether their identity has changed to include \u201cdisabled.\u201d This creates a tension between self-identification as disabled and the law, where it is often necessary to have clear definitions and boundaries. Excessive focus on biomarkers or black and white diagnostic criteria for long covid could inadvertently exclude people who experience debilitating symptoms that do not fit accepted definitions of disease.27 Disability is not merely a medical phenomenon but a social one, and a loss of social function should be included as part of an assessment of disability. Given the strong grassroots and patient led movement to recognise long covid, patients and advocacy groups should be included in developing disease criteria as a basis for self-identification.28 The successes of disability rights movements and other movements such as HIV/AIDS activism, in which self-advocacy formed the basis for change are instructive: nothing about us, without us.29 Establishing well defined criteria can empower people with long covid by providing a long term basis for coalitions and building communities. These can be leveraged into activism and political action to bring about social change, including by organising to motivate state responses to long covid.\n\nState obligations Diagnostic criteria can provide the basis for care and accommodations, but it is the state that is required to meet the needs of people with disabilities through medical care or other political, infrastructural, or welfare systems. In the case of long covid, these needs may be diverse. People with organ injury will require continued and robust access to affordable and accessible healthcare. Those whose symptoms impair mobility may require aids or modifications to their physical environments, like many other people with physical disabilities. People with cognitive deficits, profound fatigue, or psychiatric symptoms may require specific support\u2014for example, access to unemployment or other benefits, modifications to their work duties or schedule, or allowances for remote working when symptoms preclude commuting.30 Flexible attendance and modified activities for students with brain fog and other stress mediated effects of long covid may be necessary to support educational attainment.31 Increases in funding for, training, and availability of home care aides for families will arguably be needed when care givers and primary earners are affected by long covid. Many of these accommodations and improvements will arguably be best financed or accomplished through state intervention and may require policy interventions. For example, private firms may decide against the perceived additional expense of accessibility unless it is considered \u201creasonable\u201d and enforceable by legal protections such as the Equality Act in the UK. Given the potential scale of long covid, novel workplace legislation mandating the right to remote work and flexible work hours (for long covid as well as other important needs such as other disabilities, family illness, and childrearing) would improve accessibility. There may even be grounds to invert the status quo on accessibility and make the right to flexible work a presumption, effectively placing the onus on employers to justify on-site work requirements. For people whose symptoms flare or require additional medical leave, legislation introducing formal paid time off legislation in countries that do not have it would be a step towards an equitable society built on the recognition of disability. In other cases, accommodation may simply be a public good. Historically, mobility aids such as dropped kerbs in pavements allowing access to the road and ramps into or through buildings rather than stairs benefit people with a variety of mobility needs\u2014some, but not all, resulting from disability.32 These public works are typically achievable at scale only with state support and also benefit the broader population. These accommodations are social needs that predated the pandemic but are now critical with the rise of long covid. Crucially, support services are currently understaffed and under-resourced. The covid-19 pandemic has seen the degradation or collapse of welfare services, combined in some countries with decades of defunding and neglect.33 These services now have millions of new users. Recognition, respect, access to care, and an adjustment of our social norms and infrastructure have long been demands of disability activists. Covid-19, as in many other areas of life, may have shown the depth of our failures, but it did not create them. The emergence of long covid has made visible an emerging disability community that has the potential to shine a light on disability rights. What is now needed is a concerted political will to act to benefit the millions of individuals who are, or will become, disabled as a result of this global pandemic. Key messages The rise of long covid has created millions of new people with disabilities who will have to navigate the post-pandemic world\n\nThe need for change to support people with disabilities predated the pandemic\n\nLong covid needs to be legally recognised as disabling through clinical research and practice\n\nThe state must support people with long covid through expanded or reformed infrastructure and policy and by changing social norms\n\nSuch changes will benefit all disabled people and wider society\n\nFootnotes Contributors and sources: The authors include philosophers, public health experts, and social scientists.

These limitations complicated efforts to assess the true risk of severe disease and mortality associated with omicron infection.\n\nThe linked retrospective cohort study by Ward and colleagues (doi:10.1136/bmj-2022-070695) takes a further step towards addressing this question. The study reported new evidence that mortality rates were lower for infections with the omicron BA.1 subvariant than for the delta variant of concern, even after controlling for patient demographics, previous infection, and vaccination status.\n\nThe study team used the United Kingdom\u2019s Office for National Statistics Public Health Data Asset to access census data, mortality records, vaccination dates, and other standardised measures for over one million UK adults who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in December 2021 when omicron and delta were circulating. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction test results were mined for spike gene target failure, with specimens failing to amplify the S gene classified as BA.1 compatible. Although less reliable than whole genome sequencing, this technique can distinguish delta from BA.1 by detecting the deletion at positions 69 and 70 of the spike gene characteristic of BA.1 (present in almost 95% of BA.1 lineage sequences v 0.2% of delta).5 Death certification records definitively identified over 350 covid-19 related deaths in the cohort. Ultimately, the risk of covid-19 related death was found to be 66% lower in people infected with omicron than in those with delta, similar to the 69% lower risk reported by Nyberg and colleagues.4\n\nThis study provides the most conclusive evidence to date that infection with the omicron subvariant BA.1 was inherently less deadly than delta when controlling for a number of key covariates. Combining death certification records with molecular surveillance is the main advantage of this study, which avoids previous biases in covid-19 death designations. Accounting for a broad array of standardised covariates, including sociodemographic variables, pre-existing health conditions, and previous immunity, is another strength.\n\nSimilar to previous reports, risk of covid-19 death with omicron decreased in unvaccinated and vaccinated populations. Although the reduction was more pronounced in unvaccinated and boosted populations relative to the double vaccinated, this is likely skewed by the very low mortality rate among vaccinated people and the fact that booster shots were prioritised for at-risk populations during the study period.\n\nThe study also has some limitations that curtail its generalisability. Despite the strengths of the Public Health Data Asset, data collection is limited to adults in the UK and might not reflect observations in other countries or in children. A reliance on hospital system data likewise could skew cohort characteristics due to possible biases in the population captured by these data. Finally, as previously noted, the use of spike gene target failure as a proxy for variant identification carries some risk of misclassification.\n\nWhile consensus is forming that omicron infections are associated with lower mortality rates (including preliminary data on BA.4 and BA.5), several considerations remain. Firstly, it is still unclear why the risk of death is lower. Is this due to omicron\u2019s increased capacity to avoid immune recall67 leading to lower immune activation, altered viral tropism,89 changes in anatomical localisation,10 improvements in clinical care, or a combination of these and other factors?

        "Conclusions These findings indicate that adolescent and young adult men are at the highest risk of myocarditis after mRNA vaccination. Use of a Pfizer vaccine over a Moderna vaccine and waiting for more than 30 days between doses might be preferred for this population. Incidence of myocarditis in children aged 5-11 years is very rare but certainty was low. Data for clinical risk factors were very limited. A clinical course of mRNA related myocarditis appeared to be benign, although longer term follow-up data were limited. Prospective studies with appropriate testing (eg, biopsy and tissue morphology) will enhance understanding of mechanism.\n\nResults 46 studies were included (14 on incidence, seven on risk factors, 11 on characteristics and short term course, three on longer term outcomes, and 21 on mechanisms). Incidence of myocarditis after mRNA vaccines was highest in male adolescents and male young adults (age 12-17 years, range 50-139 cases per million (low certainty); 18-29 years, 28-147 per million (moderate certainty)). For girls and boys aged 5-11 years and women aged 18-29 years, incidence of myocarditis after vaccination with BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) could be fewer than 20 cases per million (low certainty). Incidence after a third dose of an mRNA vaccine had very low certainty evidence. For individuals of 18-29 years, incidence of myocarditis is probably higher after vaccination with mRNA-1273 (Moderna) compared with Pfizer (moderate certainty). Among individuals aged 12-17, 18-29, or 18-39 years, incidence of myocarditis or pericarditis after dose two of an mRNA vaccine for covid-19 might be lower when administered \u226531 days compared with \u226430 days after dose one (low certainty). Data specific to men aged 18-29 years indicated that the dosing interval might need to increase to \u226556 days to substantially drop myocarditis or pericarditis incidence. For clinical course and short term outcomes, only one small case series (n=8) was found for 5-11 year olds. In adolescents and adults, most (>90%) myocarditis cases involved men of a median 20-30 years of age and with symptom onset two to four days after a second dose (71-100%). Most people were admitted to hospital (\u226584%) for a short duration (two to four days). For pericarditis, data were limited but more variation than myocarditis has been reported in patient age, sex, onset timing, and rate of admission to hospital. Three case series with longer term (3 months; n=38) follow-up suggested persistent echocardiogram abnormalities, as well as ongoing symptoms or a need for drug treatments or restriction from activities in >50% of patients. Sixteen hypothesised mechanisms were described, with little direct supporting or refuting evidence.\n\nEligibility criteria for selecting studies Large (>10 000 participants) or population based or multisite observational studies and surveillance data (incidence and risk factors) reporting on confirmed myocarditis or pericarditis after covid-19 mRNA vaccination; case series (n\u22655, presentation, short term clinical course and longer term outcomes); opinions, letters, reviews, and primary studies focused on describing or supporting hypothesised mechanisms.\n\nData sources Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from 6 October 2020 to 10 January 2022; reference lists and grey literature (to 13 January 2021). One reviewer completed screening and another verified 50% of exclusions, using a machine learning program to prioritise records. A second reviewer verified all exclusions at full text, extracted data, and (for incidence and risk factors) risk of bias assessments using modified Joanna Briggs Institute tools. Team consensus determined certainty of evidence ratings for incidence and risk factors using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation).\n\nObjectives To synthesise evidence on incidence rates and risk factors for myocarditis and pericarditis after use of mRNA vaccination against covid-19, clinical presentation, short term and longer term outcomes of cases, and proposed mechanisms.\n\nFinally, we asked what are the hypothesised mechanisms involved in myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with mRNA covid-19 vaccines, and do they vary by patient or vaccine characteristics?\n\nThe fourth question asked what the prognosis is in the longer term (\u22654 weeks) among individuals of a similar age and sex who had myocarditis or pericarditis after mRNA covid-19 vaccination, and does this vary by patient characteristics or vaccine?\n\nThirdly, what are the characteristics and short term clinical course of myocarditis or pericarditis after covid-19 vaccination, in children younger than 12 years, recipients of any age after a third dose, and individuals with a history of myocarditis after mRNA covid-19 vaccination? From our original review, what are the characteristics and short term clinical course of myocarditis or pericarditis after covid-19 vaccination (ie, across all ages and after a second vaccine dose)?\n\nSecondly, among individuals of a similar age and sex, what risk or protective factors exist for myocarditis and pericarditis after mRNA covid-19 vaccination? Examples of factors include pre-existing conditions (eg, cardiac diseases, immunocompromise), previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic) or other viral infections, pharmacotherapies (eg, hormones), type of vaccine product, length of vaccine dosing interval, and vaccine combinations for first v second v booster doses.\n\nWe asked five main questions for the review. Firstly, what is the incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis after mRNA covid-19 vaccination? We used data stratified by age and sex, in individuals aged 0-4, 5-11, 12-17, or 18-29 years after their second dose, recipients of any age after a third dose, and individuals with a history of myocarditis after mRNA covid-19 vaccination.\n\nThis evidence synthesis included systematic reviews of incidence rates (in people aged 0-39 years) and risk factors for myocarditis and pericarditis after covid-19 mRNA vaccination, evidence reviews of initial presentation and clinical course and of longer term outcomes of cases, and a description of proposed mechanisms and their supporting evidence. We originally reviewed (in our literature search on 6 October 2021) incidence rates, risk factors, and case presentation and short term outcomes of myocarditis or pericarditis after covid-19 vaccination across all vaccines, ages, and sexes. Our results indicated that incident rates were very low to none after non-mRNA vaccines and in adults aged 40 years and older, that rates after mRNA vaccination varied by sex, age, and dose, and that the case characteristics and clinical course of myocarditis and pericarditis differed. 15 At that time, no data were available for children aged <12 years or for people after receiving a third dose. For this review, we refined the questions to focus on gaps and priorities of the stakeholder or decision maker, specifically, mRNA vaccines, priority age and risk groups, and cases after a third vaccine dose. Where possible, we limited cases to those confirmed by medical record review and of myocarditis or myopericarditis, or pericarditis rather than in combination (when data were available separately). We also expanded the scope to include evidence on longer term outcomes. Finally, we added descriptions and studies of hypothesised mechanisms. This report focuses on the refined questions but also includes findings on characteristics and short term clinical course of myocarditis or pericarditis after any dose of the vaccine across all ages from the original review.\n\nMyocarditis, an inflammatory disease of the myocardium, and pericarditis, an inflammatory disease of the pericardial sac, can occur in isolation, although some patients present with overlapping features. Viral causes are common for both disorders. Symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis typically include new onset and persisting chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or a combination of these symptoms. 11 Diagnosis of a probable case of myocarditis usually requires elevated troponin concentrations or findings from imaging (eg, echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging) or other testing (eg, echocardiogram); histopathology for a definitive diagnosis is not usually done. 12 Differential diagnoses, including covid-19 infection or other viruses, should be considered and ruled out. 12 13 Most people with these conditions will fully recover. Myocarditis can lead to heart failure or asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, whereas long term consequences associated with pericarditis include one or more recurrences and, rarely, thickening of the pericardium and constrictive heart filling. 14\n\nCase reports and surveillance signals 1 2 3 4 of myocarditis (including myopericarditis) and pericarditis after covid-19 vaccination appeared as early as April 2021, leading to the surveillance of adverse events of special interest after vaccination with mRNA vaccines manufactured by Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273). Estimated rates of myocarditis are 11 per 100 000 person years in the UK 5 and 1-2 cases per 100 000 person years in the US, 6 7 regardless of age. In the US, estimated background rates or expected rates after covid-19 vaccination of myocarditis is 0.2 per one million people and of pericarditis is 1.4 per one million people, after adjustment for a 7 day risk period where most cases appear. 6 Historically, myocarditis has been more prevalent in male than female individuals, from childhood through young adulthood, 8 and this tendency was reflected in early post-covid-19 vaccination case series. 9 10\n\nMethods\n\nWe developed a protocol before screening began and synthesis of evidence. Knowledge users from the Public Health Agency of Canada contributed to scoping the reviews but did not participate in their conduct. We followed guidance for systematic reviews when conducting16 and reporting17 questions one and two. The reviews are now living and future updates will be posted on the COVID-END website at https://www.mcmasterforum.org/networks/covid-end.\n\nLiterature search We worked with an experienced medical information specialist to develop the search strategy, which was peer reviewed (see acknowledgments).18 Searches combined concepts for covid-19, vaccines, and myocarditis, pericarditis, cardiovascular manifestations, adverse events, surveillance; each concept included various keyword and medical subject heading terms. We originally searched on 6 October 2021 and updated the search on 10 January 2022; the updated search (appendix 1) was slightly modified from the original search (eg, adding omicron, removing non-mRNA vaccine terms). We did not add limits for language, country, or study design, but had limits to exclude case reports and news or newspaper articles. Using the multifile option as well as the de-duplication tool in Ovid, we searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) and epub ahead of print, in-process, in-data-review and other non-indexed citations and daily from 1946 to 10 January 2022, inclusive, and Embase 1974 to 10 January 2022, inclusive. We searched grey literature by scanning 20 key national websites (eg, Public Health Agency of Canada, UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) to identify unpublished data. On 13 January 2022, we searched L-OVE, CT.gov, Cochrane covid Reg, WHO Covid reg, and Google Scholar for additional grey literature. We scanned reference lists of included studies and systematic reviews and consulted our clinician authors (AM and IP) and an expert consultant (Bruce McManus; see acknowledgments) to identify potentially eligible studies on mechanisms. All studies and reports included in the original review were screened for eligibility for the revised questions in this update.\n\nEligibility criteria Our inclusion criteria are outlined in box 1. Studies could be eligible for more than one question. Box 1 Eligibility criteria for each question Population People of any age; data for questions one and two (Q1 and Q2) must be reported using age categories (eg, 0-4, 5-11, 12-17, 18-29, 30-39, \u226540 years) and by dose. If incidence rates were very low and for question two on risk factors, we included data across sexes if no other study reported by sex.\n\nIncident rates after a second dose of vaccine in Q1 were intended to be limited to people younger than 30 years; because several studies reported on an 18-39-year-old category, we included these data, as well as that for people aged 30-39 years, in a post hoc manner. Intervention or exposure Q1: mRNA vaccines approved in Canada: BNT162b2 RNA/PfizerBioNTech/Comirnaty, mRNA-1273/Moderna Spikevax (alternative manufacturers of same vaccine are eligible), by type of vaccine and dose.\n\nQ2: Same as Q1, plus potential risk or protective factors: pre-existing conditions (eg, cardiac diseases, immunocompromise), previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic) or other viral infections, length of vaccine dosing interval, type of vaccine, vaccine combination for first versus second versus booster doses.\n\nQ3-Q5: Confirmed myocarditis or pericarditis after mRNA covid-19 vaccination. For Q3, part 2, cases did not need to be confirmed.\n\nAt least one dose of the vaccine needed to be with an mRNA vaccine; one or more other doses might have been with a non-mRNA vaccine.\n\nFor Q3-Q5, we included exposure to myocarditis or pericarditis (combined) if no separate data were available. Control or comparator Q1: People previously vaccinated with mRNA covid-19 vaccine but no longer at risk for outcome, previously vaccinated with other vaccines (ie, controlling for confounders associated with vaccine uptake), or unvaccinated people; or no comparator.\n\nQ2: People vaccinated with mRNA covid-19 vaccine but without the risk or protective factor. Might be a different type of mRNA vaccine, interval between doses, or mixture of vaccines for different doses.\n\nQ3: No comparator.\n\nQ4: No comparator but will include data for any comparisons with people vaccinated and no myocarditis or pericarditis.\n\nQ5: People previously vaccinated with mRNA covid-19 vaccine who did not have myocarditis or pericarditis; or no comparator. Outcome Q1: Incidence rate or cumulative risk of confirmed myocarditis (including myopericarditis) or pericarditis by dose. Effect measures: incidence rate or cumulative risk (might be risk difference if accounting for background rate in control group). Will include rates of myocarditis or pericarditis (reported collectively) if no data are available for these separately.\n\nQ2: Ratio measures of incidence or reported events by risk or protective factor (eg, RR or odds ratios), adjusted for key confounders (eg, previous covid-19 illness and severity) when reported. Will include rates of myocarditis or pericarditis (reported collectively) if no data is available for these separately.\n\nQ3: Characteristics of the patients (eg, age, sex, pre-existing conditions (eg, cardiac diseases) and infections (eg, recent or past SARS-CoV-2 infection), race and ethnicity) and case presentation (eg, timing, dose, type of vaccine; diagnostics; illness severity; treatments provided; short-term outcomes).\n\nQ4: As in Q3, plus any outcomes measured \u22654 weeks after onset of myocarditis or pericarditis (eg, re-admission to hospital, functional capacity, chest pain).\n\nQ5: Authors\u2019 summaries of any hypotheses or findings after investigating potential mechanisms (eg, histology, experiments with viral spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 (encoded by mRNA vaccine)), gene panels, serology for innate and acquired immune system components, autoimmune antibodies). Setting Any setting and country.* Study design Q1: Large (>10 000 vaccinated people) sample or multisite or health system based observational studies; reports or databases of confirmed case using surveillance data.\n\nQ2: Observational studies (including case control studies) with number of \u226510 with the risk or protective factor; data for subset of people with myocarditis or pericarditis may come from passive reporting systems.\n\nQ3: Case series with five or more cases; data could come from medical record review of cases reported to active or passive surveillance systems (if reporting more than age, sex, and dose and type of vaccine); for Q3, part 2, we relied first on case series reported in systematic reviews and added data on cases from more recent case series or studies included for incident rates if they reported sufficient data on clinical course.\n\nQ4: Case series with at least five cases; data might come from medical record review of cases reported to active or passive surveillance systems.\n\nQ5: Any primary study, systematic review, or expert opinion article or letter on the topic.\n\nLetters and commentaries will be included if they provide sufficient data. Publication language English full texts.\n\nWe cite those excluded based on language. Publication year and status From October 2020 onwards (vaccines were authorised in mid-September 2020).\n\nPreprints are included. RETURN TO TEXT\n\nStudy selection All reviewers JP, LH, LB, LG, and AW undertaking screening conducted a pilot round in Excel using 300 records. We then conducted screening in DistillerSR (Evidence Partners) using structured forms. For title and abstract review, we applied the machine learning program Daisy AI, which continually reprioritises records during screening.19 Records were divided among reviewers with one reviewer screening titles and abstracts and another reviewer verifying exclusions for the first 50% of records. For full text selection, one reviewer reviewed all records, and a second reviewer verified all exclusions. Studies were further verified for inclusion during data extraction. For question three part 2, we mapped the case series by country and data source to identify the most recent and comprehensive data source for each geographical region (ie, US, Canada, UK, Europe, and Israel). For regions with multiple reports, we prioritised data that were most recent, most comprehensive (largest numbers), and based on confirmed cases of myocarditis and pericarditis. We aimed to avoid overlap in data (ie, the same cases reported in different sources). However, we did include sources that reported on specific subgroups (eg, 12-17 year olds) to present more details on these groups of interest. We have noted in the tables where overlap might be present in cases between reports and we avoided aggregating events and counts across studies.\n\nData extraction We extracted all data into a structured format in Microsoft Word and conducted a pilot exercise with two studies for each question. Thereafter, one reviewer extracted data and another verified study eligibility and all data. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or by a review lead (JP or LH). For question one, we extracted data that related to all elements of the eligibility criteria (box 1) and data used for risk of bias assessment. We focused on methods for identifying cases (ie, passive surveillance versus active surveillance or registry data), outcome ascertainment and confirmation or adjudication (including criteria for case definitions and classification), as well as the dosing interval and risk interval for which the events were captured. We preferred estimates of incidence compared with an unexposed group (ie, excess incidence or risk differences) over those without a control. For question two, we extracted data as for question one, along with associations or subgroup analyses based on pre-existing conditions, different vaccine types or products, dosing interval, and combinations of vaccines. We extracted rates in each group and (if reported) the relative effects between groups (eg, incidence rate ratio and odds ratios), adjusted for key confounders (ie, infection status, cardiac and immunodeficiency or autoimmune conditions) when reported. For questions three and four, we based data extraction on the evidence table presented in an existing review9 because these findings covered most of the items specified under our outcomes in box 1. We added the following items: criteria for confirmation of cases, breakdown of cases by diagnosis (myocarditis, pericarditis, myopericarditis), data source, age included, percentage of patients with pre-existing conditions, percentage of patients admitted to an intensive care unit, percentage of patients admitted to hospital, and number of fatalities. For question four, we also added longer term investigations and outcomes. For question five, we extracted verbatim authors\u2019 summaries of any hypotheses and, where available, findings by the authors or cited works investigating potential mechanisms (eg, histology, gene panels, serology for innate and acquired immune system components, autoimmune antibodies, tissue biopsies, autopsy findings, etc). We checked references used to support statements made by authors in proposing or explaining hypotheses to identify whether they provided direct empirical evidence (ie, specific to covid-19 mRNA vaccination). Three content experts (AM, IP, BM) reviewed proposed mechanisms for comprehensiveness and interpretation.\n\nRisk of bias assessment For questions one and two, all reviewers involved in the risk of bias assessments (JP, LB, LG, and AW) piloted the risk of bias tool with two papers. We used the JBI (formerly Joanna Briggs Institute) checklist for cohort studies,20 with modifications mainly to ascertain valid risk factor measurement (appendix 2). We focused on valid and reliable case finding and confirmation, and, for question two, accounting for key confounders. Assessments were completed by one reviewer and verified by another. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or by a review lead. For questions three and four, we did not assess the risk of bias of the included studies. The intent of these questions was to characterise patients and their clinical course, rather than providing quantitative estimates, for example, of incidence. In this case, we judged the main risk of bias to come from case ascertainment: whether each report includes only cases confirmed or verified by clinicians. To deal with this potential bias, we limited inclusion to confirmed cases (question three part 1 and question four) or extracted this information and considered its potential effect when summarising the results (question three part 2).\n\nData synthesis and certainty assessments For question one, we did not pool results due to heterogeneity in case finding (passive v active surveillance), dosing and risk intervals, age groupings, and, in some cases, some degree of overlap in cases expected between studies. We tabulated all results and compared and contrasted findings between studies based on the major differentiating population, vaccine, and methodological variables. We report the range in incidence rates across studies, or, when all rates are low, concluded that the incidence is fewer than 20 cases per million, which, based on our clinical investigator input, we considered very rare. Based on input from clinicians and our knowledge users from Public Health Agency of Canada, we developed the key age categories (0-4, 5-11, 12-17, and 18-29 years) to rely on when possible. If a study contributed more than one result within these (eg, 20-24 and 25-29, results for each mRNA vaccine) we calculated a weighted average (eg, by proportion of years in the age range) of the incident rates. When a study reported an incidence rate (or data to calculate this) and an incidence rate ratio compared with a control or background rate, but not the difference in incidence (excess incidence over background rate), we calculated the excess incidence (ie, crude incidence \u2212 (crude incidence/ incidence rate ratio)). We assessed the certainty for each of our conclusion statements using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidance.212223 We did not apply a threshold for an important incidence rate, but in general, we considered fewer than 20 cases per million doses to be very rare. For question two, associations (odds ratio or relative risk) of 1.5 or more were considered clinically relevant (ie, odds ratio <1.5 shows little-to-no association). Observational studies for incident rates (question one) started at low certainty (ie, our confidence in the incident rate is limited; the true rate might be substantially different from the estimate) and studies on risk factors (question two) started at high certainty21 (ie, we are very confident that the true difference in rate between risk groups lies close to the estimate). We rated down for serious concerns about risk of bias, inconsistency or absence of consistency (single study), indirectness, imprecision, or reporting biases. We rated down for risk of bias when only studies having high risk for case ascertainment contributed to an outcome (eg, passive surveillance where we assume there is under-ascertainment). We also rated down for indirectness for comparisons across both sexes or if the age group reported did not match one of our groups of interest (eg, 13-39 year olds) and the incident rates could vary substantially among ages. We rated down for imprecision in groups with fewer people than would be expected for one event to occur based on estimated baseline incidence rates (eg, a subgroup with 8000 people but reporting zero events). We considered uprating when incidence rates were large (eg, twice or more than our 20 per million threshold) when no other major limitations were evident and we had moderate confidence in our conclusion, often reported as a range of incidences.24 In our conclusions, we have used the terms probably, might, and uncertain to reflect, respectively, moderate, low, or very low certainty of evidence based on GRADE. When we have very low certainty, we made no conclusions about specific incident rates or other outcomes. For questions three and four, we present the details for each case series in an evidence table and provide a descriptive summary. For question five, we present a summary of the mechanisms and a more descriptive table.",

        "By Tyler Durden | 6 August 2022\n\nZERO HEDGE \u2014 The effects of elevated food prices have rippled worldwide and forced governments to impose price controls and trade restrictions. Price increases are due to supply constraints driven by several variables, including high energy prices, geopolitics, and weather. Ukraine restarted maritime transport of crops to the rest of the world, forcing grain prices to slip, though the food crisis is far from over.\n\nWe pointed out in April that the next challenge for the global food supply could be a plunge in rice production (read: here). Fast forward months later, and our suspicions appear to be right as India, the world\u2019s largest rice exporter, has seen planting areas of the crop decline by 13% due to heatwaves and drought.\n\nIndia accounts for 40% of the global rice trade, and a decline in production will complicate India\u2019s domestic inflation fight. It could result in export restrictions, leading to few supplies for the rest of the world. [\u2026]"

He\u2019s convinced that many historians are wrong about what killed the Aztecs.\n\n\u201cThe problem with history is that it\u2019s very ideological,\u201d Acu\u00f1a-Soto said. \u201cIn this case, it was a beautiful way of accusing the Spaniards of unimaginable cruelties and of decimating the population of Mexico.\u201d\n\nMore recent work by scientists swept aside smallpox, measles, mumps and influenza (brought in by Europeans) as likely suspects. They instead point to a typhoid-like \u201centeric fever\u201d for which there is DNA evidence on the teeth of long-dead victims.\n\nA physician named Francisco Hernandez, who witnessed the outbreak in 1576, stated that the symptoms suffered included high fever, severe headache, vertigo, black tongue, dark urine, dysentery, severe abdominal and chest pain, head and neck nodules, neurological disorders, jaundice and profuse bleeding from the nose, eyes and mouth. Death frequently occurred within three to four days. This epidemic mainly afflicted young people and seldom elder ones.\n\nA study by Ashild Vagene of the University of Tuebingen in Germany states, \u201cThe 1545-50 cocoliztli was one of many epidemics to affect Mexico after the arrival of Europeans but was specifically the second of three epidemics that were most devastating and led to the largest number of human losses estimated at 12-15 million. The first cocoliztli of 1520-1521 devastated 8 million.\u201d\n\nStudy co-author Alexander Herbig, also from Tuebingen University, stated, \u201cWe tested for all bacterial pathogens and DNA viruses for which genomic data is available,\u201d and salmonella enterica was the only germ detected.\n\nThe epidemic in 1576 occurred after a drought stretching from Venezuela to Canada, according to a study published in the science journal \u201cNature Ecology & Evolution.\u201d The cocolitzli epidemics appeared to be preceded by several years of drought. Acu\u00f1a-Soto also found that the epidemics didn\u2019t happen during the drought. They appeared only in the wet periods that followed it. That was the crucial clue he had missed: It was raining when people got sick.\n\nAnalyzing DNA extracted from 29 skeletons buried in a cocoliztli cemetery, scientists found traces of salmonella enterica bacterium of the Paratyphi C variety. This is virulent haemorrhagic fever, or \u201cbleeding-eye fever,\u201d that is transmitted through tick-bites and contact with the blood of infected animals. Very ill patients may suffer organ failure after the fifth day of illness.\n\nAll types of hemorrhagic viruses share traits. They are extremely simple, composed only of RNA enveloped in a fatty membrane, and they all must develop first in an animal host, often rodents or bats. They are commonly spread by insects, such as ticks or mosquitoes. An insect bite or direct exposure to rodent feces or urine or indirect exposure through windblown particles can pass the virus to humans. The virus must have been native-born.\n\nThe threat of such lethal disease still exists given the prolific rat populations in California cities.",

        "By Dr. Kevin Barrett\n\nThe American people, polarized as never before, can hardly agree on anything. Between the hysteria purveyed by legacy fake news media on the left, and Fox News and \u201calternative facts\u201d on the right, the mainstream political discussion is a nonstop shouting match. (And yes, I realize that alternative facts are sometimes more factual than mainstream ones.)\n\nDaniel Patrick Moynihan\u2019s witticism, \u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts,\u201d has never been more apropos. In the middle of a pandemic, it would be nice to have some trustworthy facts. Unfortunately, many of the establishment\u2019s key claims are debatable. Where, when, and how did Covid-19 emerge? Are the tests accurate? How many cases are there? How many actual deaths have occurred from Covid-19? Do lockdowns and masks really work? What are the most promising medications? Should ventilators be used, and if so, when? Could a safe and effective vaccine be devised quickly enough to help? The World Health Organization, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other establishment bureaucracies offer answers to these questions. But their answers often raise even more questions.\n\nThe U.S. claim that Covid-19 emerged naturally in October from animals at a Wuhan market is almost certainly wrong, for too many reasons to list here. The mandate to \u201ctest, test, test\u201d is questionable given the dubious reliability of the tests. For that reason and others, nobody knows how many cases exist. Likewise, it isn\u2019t always clear which deaths are Covid deaths; the official counts may be too low or too high, depending on whom you believe. Likewise, the efficacy of masks is debatable, as is the question of whether a \u201ccocktail\u201d including hydroxychloroquine and zinc, or vitamins C and/or D3, could be useful treatments. And the sensitive issue of whether ventilators have been saving patients or killing them is far from settled. Finally, the prospect of a workable vaccine, despite the billions of dollars being thrown at it, is uncertain to say the least.\n\nSo, do we know anything about Covid-19? Do we even know there is a real pandemic out there? Yes, we do. The best metric, the one least likely to be wrong, is the excess death rate: the difference between the number of deaths expected to occur in a given time frame, and the number of deaths that actually occur. Though it may not always be clear whether someone died of Covid, with Covid, or of something else that could be mistaken for Covid, the fact that the person is dead is \u201cdead certain.\u201d Procedures for counting deaths are far more accurate than, say, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques for counting viruses.\n\nWhat do overall death counts tell us? First takeaway: Prior to March 20, 2020, there were no discernable excess deaths in the U.S. Then suddenly, during the last 10 days in March, the overall death count shot up, peaking during the first two weeks of April, then quickly declining back to zero by mid-May. So, April, as\n\nTS Eliot said in another context, was indeed the cruelest month. (As of this writing, statistics for June are not yet available; but since reported Covid deaths are not keeping pace with reported new cases, it seems likely that the overall death count remained fairly flat in June.)\n\nThe spike in excess deaths in April supports the establishment narrative in some ways, but also raises questions. It confirms that Covid-19 spread wildly in February and early March, leading to the spike in April deaths. It also confirms that the March and April lockdowns were presumably effective in slowing the spread of the virus, so that by mid-May there were no more discernable excess deaths in America.\n\nBut wait! Officially, there were roughly 15,000 \u201cconfirmed Covid deaths\u201d between May 15 and June 1. Yet as we have seen, there seem to have been no overall excess deaths. Did 15,000 people who would have died otherwise somehow survive thanks to the Covid pandemic, balancing out the 15,000 Covid deaths? That seems unlikely.\n\nBut it may be that the Covid emergency is somehow saving at least some lives\u2014especially the lives of young children. According to official statistics, \u201cStarting in early March, expected deaths (of children) began a sharp decline, from an expected level of around 700 deaths per week to well under 500 by mid April and throughout May.\u201d Has the drastic drop in childhood vaccinations been saving kids\u2019 lives? Or are infants receiving more and better attention from parents who are staying home rather than working?\n\nBottom line: The Covid pandemic, and the bungling and confusing official response, has raised far more questions than answers. Those who want cold, hard facts should keep an eye on excess death statistics.\n\nKevin Barrett, Ph.D., is an Arabist-Islamologist scholar and one of America\u2019s best-known critics of the War on Terror.

        "BioLogos has invited dozens of Christian leaders to say this publicly. The statement shows the biblical basis and broad Christian support for taking the scientific findings about COVID-19 seriously in the present moment. Now, we as signers certainly don\u2019t agree on everything. We come from different political parties, different theological traditions, different racial and ethnic groups, different generations, and different parts of the country. We aren\u2019t trying to agree on public policy or what schools should do this fall. Such decisions require many considerations besides science; \u201cscience\u201d is not a one-word rationale for public policy.\n\nBut we agree that the core scientific findings are valid and should not be rejected. We know all truth is God\u2019s truth, including the truths that biomedical researchers are discovering about the virus, how it spreads, and how to fight it. An individual scientist may be biased, but many scientists check each others\u2019 work and develop good protocols to give solid results. It\u2019s not a perfect process and one can always find dissenters, but scientists working together are far more accurate than one person\u2019s theory on YouTube. We are deeply concerned that many Christians are skeptical of well-established findings and not acting on them, at a time when thousands of lives are at stake.\n\nBecause of our faith in Jesus Christ, we are committing ourselves to stand for the truth (1 Cor. 13:6) and to love our neighbors. Because of Jesus\u2019 command to care for \u201cthe least of these\u201d (Matthew 25:31-36), we are wearing masks and promoting vaccination. Because of God\u2019s passion for justice, we are caring not just for ourselves, but for the communities hardest hit by the pandemic.\n\nAnd we are committing to pray. To pray for the sick and the grieving. For elected leaders. For parents and teachers. For doctors and nurses. For researchers developing treatments and vaccines. And we pray for our cities and nation; may God bring healing, justice, and flourishing for all (Jeremiah 29:7).\n\nWill you join us? Please read the statement and prayerfully consider signing it. If you sign it, be sure to send it on to others and encourage them to do the same. As Christians, let us come together in unity, truth, and love in these pandemic times, and thus be a stronger witness to the world. They will know we are Christians by our love (John 13:35).",
        "Stump:\n\nWelcome to Language of God. I\u2019m your host, Jim Stump. This is a podcast about science and faith, and there are no two people who represent these better than Francis Collins and Tim Keller. Collins is one of the top scientists in the world, having led the Human Genome Project and now directing the National Institutes of Health; and Keller is one of the most respected pastors and authors of his generation.\n\nMost people who know something about BioLogos know that we were founded by Francis Collins. But fewer people are aware that Tim Keller had an important hand in our success. In the early days of BioLogos, there was a huge amount of suspicion from more conservative Christians about whether the science of evolution could be reconciled with the essentials of Christian faith. Keller has not hidden the fact that he himself has concerns about that. But he thought the conversation was important. So he hosted a series of private meetings in Manhattan where such conversations could take place between prominent faith leaders and scientists. Out of those meetings there was some trust that developed, without which BioLogos would not have been able to gain a hearing. And there was also a lasting friendship that developed between Tim and Francis.\n\nIn these days of the COVID-19 pandemic, both of them are busier than ever, and we were so thankful they gave of their time to talk to each other and to us about specific challenges the church and the world are facing right now. This was originally recorded as a livestream event on May 18, 2020. A link to the video of that is available in the show notes.\n\nJust two days after that event, there was a very exciting announcement that Francis has been named the 2020 Templeton Prize Laureate \u2014 an award given each year to honor someone who has made an exceptional contribution to affirming life\u2019s spiritual dimension. The prize has previously been given to Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama, Desmond Tutu, and Billy Graham, among others. We have links in the show notes to information about that, as well as to other things both Collins and Keller have written for the BioLogos website. At the end of the conversation, we\u2019re joined by BioLogos president Deb Haarsma who offers a prayer for both Collins and Keller.\n\nI think this episode gives some fascinating insights into this moment in history from two people who are uniquely positioned to guide us through it.\n\nLet\u2019s get to the conversation.\n\nInterview\n\nStump:\n\nThank you Tim and Francis. I know being quarantined at home does not mean there are fewer demands on your time. So thank you very much for this time that you\u2019ve given all of us tonight. If we could, let\u2019s just start briefly so the audience can hear that there\u2019s a broader context to this conversation and that you\u2019re not just a couple of random people we paired together. Can you talk a little bit about your relationship with each other, maybe when you became aware of each other\u2019s work, when you met, how you\u2019ve kept that relationship going? Francis, start us off, if you would.\n\nCollins:\n\nSure. Well, I knew of Tim as a pastor of Redeemer Church in New York City, which was rather famous for the way it had brought together people from all sorts of different perspectives, including lots of young urban professionals. And I actually dropped in on his church one Sunday morning when I was in New York and was totally inspired by what I saw and what I heard and the deeply thoughtful way in which he approached scripture. And so I approached him probably a few months later. I was in New York for, I think it was the Q conference that was happening, and it was a Saturday I think, and I thought, you know, I\u2019ll just take a chance here and see if Reverend Keller might actually be around, expecting there would be this huge hedge that would be protecting him from the rabble like me. But instead, he was quite available and quite happy to talk. And I guess I probably went straight to my concern about how science and faith didn\u2019t seem to be getting along very well and this seemed like a bad thing for the Christian Church as well as for the scientific community and wondered what he thought about that. And I think he almost immediately bonded about this being a problem that really is vexing the future of the church and maybe we together had a pretty interesting conversation about what we might do about it. Which then ultimately led to a friendship and to involvement by Tim and BioLogos, which has tried, for its very essence to do exactly that\u2014bring scientists and people of faith together and figure out how we can learn from each other and even worship together.\n\nStump:\n\nWhat do you remember of those days, Tim? Was Francis really the rabble that he says he may have been?\n\nKeller:\n\nNo, not at all. I\u2019m sorry to start off our hour by saying that he\u2019s just wrong. I read his book, Language of God, I quote the book in Reason for God, which I wrote in 2007\u2014Language of God came out in 2006\u2014so my memory is that when Francis Collins wanted to see me, I felt honored. So there goes that whole rabble theory. Gone. And so that must have been after both those books were out, Francis. I\u2019m pretty sure. And then the first two or three times that we had conferences, consultations, that basically turned into BioLogos, I was a co-leader of those right here in New York City. And we\u2019ve kept our relationship up since then.\n\nStump:\n\nHow have you kept up your relationship? I can\u2019t imagine you see each other every day. But?\n\nKeller:\n\nWell, sometimes we actually have emailed back and forth on issues of human origins where we don\u2019t agree.\n\nCollins:\n\nThere are some.\n\nKeller:\n\nIt\u2019s also true. That it is possible, by the way, to be friends and disagree. I\u2019m also kind of an outlier member of a reading group that Francis is in with other people who are in DC. And occasionally I drop in on that. So that we\u2019ve kept it up somehow. It\u2019s not been easy.\n\nCollins:\n\nYeah. And I\u2019ve even occasionally dropped in on your church in New York, if I knew you were preaching, which I guess you do less of these days, but boy, it\u2019s been wonderful to have a chance to learn from you.\n\nStump:\n\nWell, let\u2019s move to the topic at hand at hand. This pandemic has radically changed all of our lives. Would each of you share just a bit of how it\u2019s affecting you personally? Tim, you live and work in New York City, the epicenter of this outbreak. What\u2019s that done to your normal rhythms of life at work?\n\nKeller:\n\nWell, I\u2019m no different than anyone else. It\u2019s been completely disruptive of normal rhythms. Two things I could say about how it\u2019s affected me personally. One is, first of all, my wife and I stayed here. And that\u2019s the first thing and that\u2019s worth talking about. Martin Luther, many years ago obviously, wrote a fascinating piece on whether\u2026it\u2019s Whether One May Flee a Deadly Plague. That\u2019s the name of it. And it\u2019s on the internet, easy to find. And what\u2019s remarkable about it, it\u2019s very biblical and very brave and yet, that his answer is, it depends. May a Christian flee? It depends. He says it is absolutely okay, considering the value God puts on human life, to do what it takes to preserve your own life. On the other hand, if you\u2019ve got a duty of any kind in a place where it\u2019s dangerous, Christians should not flee because they should be not afraid to die. We\u2019re not quite there. On the other hand, I\u2019ve been a leader in the church, I\u2019m not the pastor of any one church now, I work for Redeemer City to City, which helps churches get started in big cities around the world. But nevertheless, I\u2019ve been a leader in the church for 30 years, and it did feel like I should stay. So I\u2019m following Martin Luther. So we stayed, though it\u2019s a dangerous place to be. And nevertheless, we stayed.\n\nNumber two, we\u2019ve grieved a lot. First of all, there\u2019s a lot of physical devastation here because I work with Redeemer City to City, we\u2019re involved with churches across the city and so many churches, especially in less well resourced neighborhoods, we could say, have really been devastated. There\u2019s one church that we reconnected with that there\u2019s 13 people that have died in it. Then there\u2019s the economic devastation. There\u2019s social devastation. An awful lot of the kids in the schools, where they were already behind in the poor areas, those are the folks that are not keeping up with online, you know, instruction, etc. And so the kids that were far behind or are getting further behind so there\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s grievous. And one last thing to say is, when you go week after week after week without any good news, you\u2019re either reading about the virus or you\u2019re reading about something that\u2019s not the virus, it\u2019s usually bad news, it drains you spiritually. And I can feel it, especially here, where people were rightly concerned about infection because we were in the middle of such a hotspot. So it\u2019s been difficult, even though, you know, God has kept both me and my wife free from the virus and our immediate family most of which lives here have also not been touched. Nevertheless, it\u2019s been\u2026 We stay, we\u2019ve grieved.\n\nStump:\n\nHow about you, Francis, working in Washington DC and balancing scientific work with public perception and even politics, I\u2019m sure has made a whole other dimension to all of this for you.\n\nCollins:\n\nYeah, you could say that. Well, I\u2019m speaking to you tonight from my home office, which is where I have essentially been for the last eight weeks. I have only maybe four times left the house to go to any official duty thing. I\u2019ve been running NIH from this desk right here. All those books behind me are my library on science and faith. And I occasionally have to pull those down to get myself some encouragement. But it is an incredibly intense time because you feel this incredible sense of urgency about marshaling every possible scientific capability, bringing all the bright brains of the planet together and trying to figure out how can we quickly move forward identifying treatments for people who are sick with COVID-19, speeding up the development of those vaccines that everybody\u2019s waiting for, coming up with new ways to do testing that are easier for people to have access to. All of that is right smack in the middle of NIH\u2019s wheelhouse. That\u2019s what we do. We\u2019re the largest supporter of medical research in the world and we\u2019re all hands on deck. But it\u2019s weird doing this through Zoom meetings and conference calls and piles of email beyond anything I could have imagined. And yet trying to keep the momentum going, trying to encourage the morale of my staff who are scattered all over the place, many of them working from home, many of them worried about themselves, their families. And we in our own staff at NIH have had close to 200 people who\u2019ve been infected. Fortunately, most of them done well. But this is very real all around us. It\u2019s not just a scientific adventure. It\u2019s life and death. And I\u2019ve done a lot of scientific adventures, but nothing that quite has this sense of acute urgency.\n\nStump:\n\nWe last talked about six weeks ago, Francis, in this format, at which time there had been about 10,000 deaths in the US. Now we\u2019re up to almost ten times that many. Is that what you expected of all of this? Or have we flattened the curve or what do we expect from here?\n\nCollins:\n\nWell, it would have been worse if we had not had Americans do what Americans have been doing, which is to accept those recommendations about staying at home and practicing social distancing and washing their hands and wearing masks now wherever you go outside, not to protect yourself, but to protect other people from you in case you happen to be carrying the virus, and simply by the act of speaking, you may be spreading it around. I\u2019m really impressed with our nation, where people have taken this upon themselves for the most part without having an autocratic government tell them that you have to but doing it because it is the right thing to do. It would have been, I\u2019m sure, much worse had those steps not been taken. But it is still intensely tragic. Those numbers, after a while you\u2019re sort of numbed by them. I look at them every morning because we have a team that meets at 7:30 to see where we are. And every time there\u2019s another 1500, 2000 deaths in America. And it\u2019s heartbreaking to imagine that each one of those represents a terrible tragedy of a lost soul that this virus has claimed. And you sort of feel like we\u2019ve got to do everything we can to try to bend that curve back down. New York has done a pretty amazing job of getting over the top of their curve and coming back down, although they have a long way to go. But a lot of the rest of the country has not actually achieved that yet. And I worry that people are just getting exhausted with this whole business of physical distancing and wanting relief and wanting to be out in the sunshine because it\u2019s starting to be really nice weather. And we still have a terrible risk of another wave of this if we don\u2019t do this in a very careful, sensible way.\n\nStump:\n\nTim, talk about the church\u2019s response a little bit to all of this, the good, the bad, and the ugly, perhaps. What have you seen that makes you proud of the body of Christ? What are some things that perhaps we could be doing better?\n\nKeller:\n\nWell, I would say you left something out good, bad, ugly. I would say there\u2019s also the non. That is to say I\u2019m not sure on the whole the church has responded yet. There\u2019s been an extremely small percentage of churches that have, you know, defied government directives, and they are because of the publicity they get, there seems to be far more than there really are. And that\u2019s the bad or the ugly. However\u2026after 9/11 in New York City, where really this was the place where we had the devastation of 9/11, everybody came together immediately. As a matter of fact, all the churches were jammed. People who never went to church came, and what you were able to do is you\u2019re able to speak words of comfort to the whole community in those churches. We were able to immediately get out there to start to help the unemployed, immediately get out there to give aid to people who had been traumatized. We were able to immediately respond and actually the quarantine means that we actually can\u2019t do what churches do.\n\nSo in some ways, I would say there\u2019s going to be two periods. There\u2019s going to be the interim period when the lockdowns, the restrictions start to ease up. I call that an interim period where there\u2019s still gonna be restrictions, but there\u2019ll be coming off in stages. And then after that, which is the immediate aftermath, even when the restrictions are gone, let\u2019s say the vaccines out there, there\u2019s going to be all sorts of\u2014well we\u2019re not sure what they\u2019re going to be yet\u2014cultural, social and economic effects that are going to last for a while. And in that situation, basically, and this is an overstatement perhaps but this is how you get people to listen. All churches are going to have to get replanted. See we don\u2019t even know who\u2019s there. When we reconvene, who will be there? I\u2019m a church planter. I planted Redeemer and City to City, the organization I work with, helps new churches get started across the city and it takes a lot of ingenuity. It takes tremendous focus on people outside the church. You can\u2019t ignore them. You have to say what is the needs of our neighborhood? Secondly, it takes a tremendous amount of concentration on what are the needs of people inside the church, you can\u2019t just run programs, you know, and get up there and preach your sermon and draw your paycheck. You\u2019ve got to meet needs inside, meet needs outside, and you\u2019ve also got to be innovative. You\u2019ve got to be thinking about the new situation and how do I maximize opportunities that come from this new situation? How do I minimize the disadvantages? That\u2019s how you plant a church. And unfortunately, I think all churches are going to have to get replanted. And we\u2019re all going to have to say, how do we meet needs inside, outside, and how do we respond to these changes? And that will be a test. So I would say so far 95% of churches have not yet responded. And in the next two periods after this, there will be\u2026it will really be a test. There\u2019s a great chance for witness to the presence of the kingdom and to the reality of Jesus in this time, but it\u2019s also I would say, we haven\u2019t actually met the test yet.\n\nCollins:\n\nTim, it must be really tough on pastors though right now who are trying to figure out how to find their role in the midst of such an unexpected crisis and where they can\u2019t even bring people together, they can\u2019t go to funerals and preside and try to provide comfort to the grieving. It must be just unbelievable. You had a piece that somebody pointed me to, a video to pastors, which was intended for them, but I think it spoke to me too, as an encouragement about the things that one might do in this circumstance. And I think you started it off by saying, it\u2019s like when you\u2019re on an airplane and you haven\u2019t quite taken off yet and they\u2019re going through the drill, and they say something about if the oxygen mask falls from the ceiling, put on yours first, before you help the person next to you. Those pastors must be in need of oxygen, because what they\u2019re going through right now must be pretty incredibly intense and exhausting.\n\nKeller:\n\nYeah, thanks, Francis. Number one, you might remember from that, I got a phone call three days after 9/11, I got a phone call from a pastor from Oklahoma City, who had said that after the bombing in 1995, and all the crisis there, the churches and all the ministers went into tremendous overdrive. And about a year later, they all realized\u2014they started going into depression, marriages started to break up\u2014that they had actually burned out. And they didn\u2019t realize the degree to which they\u2019ve been drained. And so what I was trying to say there is\u2026by the way that oxygen mask illustration, my wife who\u2019s probably watching right now, it was her idea to say you\u2019re not going to help anybody else in the plane unless you got your oxygen mask on. And if you burn yourself out, and you die a slow death of despair underneath, while you\u2019re smiling because of course, adrenaline, the great wonder drug, lasts for a while. And then after a while, you just collapse. So you do have to put on your oxygen mask.\n\nCollins:\n\nGood advice for everybody who\u2019s listening here tonight, whether you\u2019re a pastor, or you\u2019re a parent, or you\u2019re a teacher struggling with not having your students there and trying to make the doggone internet do its purpose for your classes\u2026 Put on your oxygen mask people. You\u2019ve got to take care of yourself as well.\n\nStump:\n\nLet\u2019s talk a little bit about vaccines.\n\nCollins:\n\nOh why not!\n\nStump:\n\nAnd Francis, I saw an article that you published today with the chief officer at Johnson and Johnson about the need for federal agencies to collaborate with private industry and pharmaceutical companies to develop this as quickly as possible. I\u2019ll ask you if you\u2019ll talk a little bit about that effort. And then, Tim, if you\u2019d chime in at some point here and maybe help us in understanding the church\u2019s reaction to vaccines. That\u2019s certainly painting with too broad of a brush. But maybe we\u2019ll get into talking about some conspiracies\u2026\n\nCollins:\n\nOh good. [laughs]\n\nStump:\n\nAnd how we who call ourselves Christians are particularly prone to this with regard to vaccines, but let\u2019s hear some of the science here first, Francis.\n\nCollins:\n\nWell, I could go on for hours but you probably don\u2019t want me to, so let me try to put this into a fairly concise narrative. If you want to see this coronavirus pandemic really come to a satisfactory close, a vaccine is by far the best hope we have. But it\u2019s also extremely challenging to make it happen. We\u2019ve never built a vaccine, in all of history, in less than about three or four years. And here we are trying to do it in 12 to 18 months, as Tony Fauci has often said. And maybe even trying to push the envelope a bit on that timetable. So there is an enormous amount of scientific effort going into this with a variety of very novel approaches that have never really been done before for vaccines that are looking pretty good. One that was just reported on this morning, a vaccine that was developed so fast that it was in its first human trials 63 days after the first report of this virus from China. Usually that\u2019s like many months, 63 days, not bad. And the results of that phase one trial, where you\u2019re just checking this out in volunteers to see if it\u2019s safe and whether it produces a good immune response, looks really good. Well, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re there yet. That means you need now to expand that to give this to thousands of people in an area where the virus is currently circulating, to see, did it protect them? If you don\u2019t know that you don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s going to work. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re now moving quickly to try to scale that up to that large scale study. And that\u2019s just one vaccine, there are four or five that are coming along pretty quickly, that all have a different kind of scientific basis, which is good, because probably not all of these are going to work. I just want one of them to work.\n\nThe other thing we have to do is prepare for the fact that one of them might work and then you\u2019re going to have to scale this up. You\u2019re going to have this huge manufacturing problem, where you need to make hundreds of millions of doses. If you wait until you have the results of the full scale trial, and then start your manufacturing, you just lost several months where people are dying from this disease. So what we\u2019re doing now, thank you taxpayers, is basically to support the scale-up of the manufacturing even before we know what\u2019s going to work. So a lot of that may go to waste, but some of it we are hoping will turn out to be right. I can\u2019t tell you exactly what this timetable will look like. But I will say, particularly through this mechanism we are now invested in and working very closely with no less than 18 companies that are working on this, we are moving faster than humanity has ever seen before. And we\u2019re determined not to worry about who gets the credit, or who makes any money, but just basically let\u2019s get it done and get it out there and try to save people who otherwise are going to be a terrible risk.\n\nStump:\n\nLots of our listeners are asking these questions about vaccines and conspiracies right now. And this is what I\u2019m asking you, Tim, to channel for us a little bit, if you can, the American psyche and all of this, as Rob is asking, \u201cWe\u2019re hearing lots of conspiracy theories, particularly from Christian quarters.\u201d Any thoughts from either of you actually, how do we respond to people like that? And maybe Tim, I\u2019ll give you a little plug here because I\u2019ve been going through your new book that just came out here recently, Uncommon Ground with John Inazu, where you talk about how do we get along with people who think differently than us? You\u2019re not writing about conspiracy theorists in there, but perhaps there\u2019s some wisdom for all of us to take and how we respond to the people on our social media feeds.\n\nKeller:\n\nWell, let me start by first of all asking, Francis, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m going to scroll back. Francis, would you say the players are by and large showing a willingness to put profits and credit aside? You said that\u2019s what we have to do. We have to not care about who gets credit, not care about who\u2019s making a lot of money. But would you say that the usual suspects are actually doing a good job there?\n\nCollins:\n\nI think they are. I think they recognize this as a crisis that demands that. I even heard a leader of a pharmaceutical company saying to another rival, \u201cYou know, if your drug actually looks like it\u2019s better than mine, why don\u2019t we use my clinical trial network to expand your drug\u2019s testing, so we\u2019ll really know as soon as possible.\u201d I would not have heard that in any other setting. This is different.\n\nKeller:\n\nNo. What\u2019s what\u2019s good about that, by the way\u2014and I know, I\u2019m not following our moderator here, immediately\u2014but what\u2019s great about that is that is, well, there\u2019s a lot of talk today about the fact that this crisis has not united us. And it is true to some degree politically. After 9/11 I saw a much more uniting going on than I do this time. And there is a lot of political polarization and it is a problem. Nevertheless, there is some coming together and it might be in the medical pharmaceutical\u2026 If it happens there, then we really can be very, very grateful. That\u2019s all, so.\n\nCollins:\n\nWell that\u2019s a nice thought.\n\nKeller:\n\nYeah, to get back to your question now. You\u2019re struggling to get both Francis Collins and Tim Keller to both say something intelligent about vaccines. [laughs] I don\u2019t know a thing about vaccines! So, but what you\u2019re really asking is, there seems to be something of a real suspicion, well on the part of many, many people, about scientific expertise in this country. And it seems to be particularly acute amongst Christians and evangelical Christians. And I think that\u2019s fair. But let me just say two things. If you were asking how do you reach out to people who are different than you? Well, by both critiquing and affirming, I mean, always. If you just simply say, \u201cYou\u2019re totally wrong,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re totally right,\u201d you\u2019re not actually reaching out. Now, here\u2019s where I want to\u2014and I wouldn\u2019t mind Francis responding to especially this first one\u2014is Christians have got some reason to be wary, not so much of scientists, but of people who come, trying to make a case for something and invoking science. When actually they\u2019re making moral decisions, or philosophical, they\u2019re making philosophical arguments and they\u2019re cloaking it in science. So for example, there really are a fair number of scientists who will take their cultural capital they have a scientist, because science has a lot of cultural capital, because of all the accomplishments, and they\u2019ll say science, not too many, but there will be scientists who will say, \u201cscience proves that there\u2019s no God, that there\u2019s no soul, that there\u2019s nothing beyond this and science tells us these things.\u201d And Francis knows that we could, I\u2019m not gonna mention, we could name, there\u2019s a lot of them right now, that are making a lot of money and books saying science tells us these things. And so Christians look at that and we say, \u201cuh, well what about Francis Collins, I\u2019m sorry, science does not tell you these things and for you to be\u2026\u201d That\u2019s maybe what you might want to call scientism, which is a philosophy that says there is no knowledge other than what can be empirically proven. And there is no, there\u2019s no reality outside of the natural and material. And so when you know that that\u2019s happened, and you there\u2019s a history to that at that. At that point, you know, you can see why Christians will start to get wary of people coming in saying, \u201cwe\u2019ve got this, this agenda and it\u2019s totally scientific.\u201d Actually, the German philosopher J\u00fcrgen Habermas has a great little line, where he says, \u201cscience can tell you what you can do and what you can\u2019t do and how to do it efficiently but science can never tell you whether or not you ought to do it.\u201d That\u2019s always going to be a moral decision. And that\u2019s a matter of faith. And therefore, you really shouldn\u2019t be throwing this on the scientists. The scientists give you the facts. They do give you the facts. But then decisions that we made on the basis of more than just that. And so I can understand that wariness. On the other hand, Christians should know better and here\u2019s where I would push back badly on folks. Herbert Butterfield some years ago, wrote a classic book called the, let me see, I wrote it down here, The Origins of Modern Science.\n\nStump:\n\nThe Origins of Modern Science\n\nKeller:\n\nYeah. Right. And he basically makes his case there that says, you know, Buddhism and Hinduism, didn\u2019t believe the physical world was real. Other ancient pagan views saw the creation always, you can look at their myths, the creation was always a result of some kind of major battle of some kind. You know, nature is basically chaotic. It\u2019s power poles fighting against each other. Along comes Christianity and says, there\u2019s one God, a personal God, who creates the world as an artist, a rational God as it were. And it\u2019s in that soil that science can grow. Because the idea is, oh, there\u2019s nature and there\u2019s a uniformity to nature and there\u2019s an orderliness to nature. And the reality is that Christianity, it was in the Christian West, where the whole idea of modern science grew up because of the view of God. Then you can just go to the Bible and you see, I won\u2019t, I\u2019ve taken too long on this question anyway. You know, Jesus knows the difference between sick people and demonic people, demon possessed people. Jesus does not see all problems as just a matter of demons. He knows that they\u2019re between a physical problem and a spiritual problem. First Timothy, Paul says to Timothy, \u201ctake some wine for your stomach,\u201d which is, you know, medicinal. You\u2019ve got a place in Isaiah 38 where God says, \u201cI\u2019m going to heal you Hezekiah but I want you to put some figs on the boil, and I\u2019ll use medicine in order to do it.\u201d God just didn\u2019t wave his hand and say, okay, you know, I don\u2019t need medicine. I mean, the Bible is just filled with all kinds of reasons to trust science, not scientism, but science. So we ought to push back on the people that are just showing a lack of humility, before a discipline that actually grew up out of Christian soil. But on the other hand, I also want to be sympathetic to the way the use of science to abuse Christians has been\u2026 It has been used. Sorry, that was kind of long, but.\n\nCollins:\n\nOh, but it was right on point, Tim. I actually agree with virtually all of that. In fact, one of the motivations for the formation of BioLogos, which is sponsoring this discussion this evening, was to try to counter the sense that the only real voices one could hear about science and faith were on the one hand, the ones you just mentioned who are arguing that science has disproved the need for God and we should just all get over it. And on the other hand, very hard edge fundamentalist views that said, you can\u2019t trust science because it disagrees with my interpretation of this verse or that verse. And most people, I don\u2019t think, really feel very comfortable in those extreme poles, but there wasn\u2019t a lot they could go to in this topic about science and faith. And that is partly why I wrote that book and partly now why BioLogos has come in to sort of occupy, in a wonderful way, that space and make a possibility of civil, loving discourse amongst people trying to sort this out.\n\nAnd it has, I guess, spilled over in the vaccine situation. And it breaks my heart to see why this has become such a nasty situation so often, between people oftentimes quite educated, who have bought into particular conspiracy theories about how vaccines are intended to just make money for pharmaceutical companies and we all know that they\u2019re actually harmful. And the kinds of information that\u2019s spread out there, particularly in social media, that any careful analysis would show is absolutely untrue, but it gets a fire started and it\u2019s very hard to put it out. And it will be very interesting to see, let\u2019s assume we do have a vaccine for COVID-19, maybe as soon as the end of this year, will there be people, even though they have seen others around them suffer and die, who will say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to have that vaccine, it\u2019s probably some kind of conspiracy.\u201d I hope and pray that\u2019s not the case. Because this is not one of those things where people have not had their own experience of seeing what the virus can do. Surely you\u2019d want to take advantage of something that could protect you and your loved ones.\n\nStump:\n\nThis pushes us into perhaps some deeper theological waters here.\n\nCollins:\n\nOh good, now Tim\u2019s going to talk more now, I think.\n\nKeller:\n\nPressure\u2019s on me.\n\nStump:\n\nBoth of you are affirming that in times like these, we should be praying for God to help us and we should also be doing our best to develop vaccines and to figure out appropriate treatments. I think our brains are not wired very easily for \u201cboth and\u201d situations like this. For audiences that seemed to think prayer or science. It seems like we have to go one way or the other. How does this work on a practical level? Tim, maybe what\u2019s God doing? We billed this event tonight as Where is God in a Pandemic? Is God sitting waiting for us to ask him to help him to do something to help the scientists figure this out? Or how do we understand God\u2019s action and God\u2019s work in times like this in relationship to our prayers and to our efforts?\n\nKeller:\n\nYeah, and by the way, I want you to know that Francis knows a lot more about theology than I know about medicine. So it\u2019s not quite a flip flop here. Well if you ask the question, where is God in the midst of all this, I mean, you have to start very theologically. And that is Christianity presents the only God that actually comes into this world and makes himself vulnerable, mortal, killable, as it were. He experiences weakness and hunger. He experiences physical weakness, injustice, torture and death. And he does this voluntarily, in order to love us, in order to save us. And because it\u2019s Jesus when he rises from the dead and he goes to heaven. You could say, somebody might say, well, sure, he was in the midst of all of our human suffering, but no longer. Except that when he meets Paul, St. Paul, on the road to Damascus, where Paul gets converted, it\u2019s in Acts chapter nine, he says to Paul, \u201cPaul, Paul, why are you persecuting me?\u201d Now, he\u2019d been killing Christians. But he says, \u201cWhy are you persecuting me?\u201d And Paul says, you know, he\u2019s looking at this glorious divine figure saying, \u201chow in the world have I been hurting you?\u201d And obviously, it means that he is present in this world, particularly among his people, in such a way that he is so connected to us that he actually is still in the midst of the suffering. He still is. And therefore when you ask where is God, if you talk about the Christian God in the midst of the pandemic, he\u2019s right here.\n\nOkay, I know what people say. Well why did he allow it to happen? In John chapter 11\u2026I preached on this the Sunday after 9/11, I always go to John 11. Jesus shows up, Lazarus has died, Mary and Martha immediately start asking, basically asking questions, I mean why did you let this happen? First of all, Jesus does not give an explanation. Now we know what it is because of our\u20262000 years later, we\u2019ve got the perspective, we know why Lazarus died. But at that point, Jesus does not give an explanation. What he actually does is he prays, he weeps, he helps, and he does so sacrificially because the thing\u2026 If you read the passage, the moment he raises Lazarus from the dead, the religious leaders decide that\u2019s the final straw, we have to kill him. So Jesus knows he can\u2019t get, he really cannot get Lazarus out of the grave without putting himself in. So he doesn\u2019t give an explanation. He\u2019s just there in the midst. And he prays and he weeps and he helps and he does it sacrificially. And that\u2019s where we got to where we have to be. Now, here\u2019s the thing, when you see Jesus doing that, without giving an explanation, we don\u2019t know why God\u2019s allowing the pandemic right now. We just know it\u2019s not because he doesn\u2019t love us. And he\u2019s got reasons for why he hasn\u2019t stopped suffering yet. We do know, Romans 8 tells us, someday he\u2019s going to stop all sickness and death, everything. We just don\u2019t know why he hasn\u2019t done it yet. But we do know whatever those reasons are, and he must have good reasons, It\u2019s not because he doesn\u2019t love us. And we should just be following what Jesus said. We shouldn\u2019t be trying to explain why when people ask, \u201cwhy is God allowing this to happen?\u201d no Christian ought to give a good answer. No Christian ought to say, well because of XYZ. They should pray, help, weep, sacrifice and be right near where everybody else is weeping and suffering.\n\nCollins:\n\nI think that\u2019s beautifully said. I think the other thing is we have to recognize that this is not the most exceptional moment in all of history, even though it may be in our own lifetime. Sometimes I hear a little bit of that reflection that nothing like this bad has ever happened before. Well, goodness, back through human history we\u2019ve had many plagues. Christians have often been at their best in those plagues, by basically doing things that people around them would not do to try to help those who are suffering. And I hope we\u2019re doing that again, in a way that people recognize, although also we need to keep ourselves safe. So yeah, and read the book of Job for heaven\u2019s sake and see whether you think there\u2019s a guarantee that God\u2019s not going to, at times, allow trouble to happen. It happens to us but he promises to be there for us.\n\nI have next to my desk a few scriptures that I have, in the course of this pandemic, pulled out and printed up just so that they were close by when I was having one of those moments. And maybe my favorite of all of them is Psalm 46, which most of you will recognize: \u201cGod is our refuge and strength, an ever present help in trouble.\u201d That does not say there will be no trouble. It says, \u201cGod is an ever present help in trouble.\u201d I am really awfully relieved to know that God is here with us in this trouble, each one of us, in ways that can provide comfort and maybe even help us to learn something that we didn\u2019t know before about what humanity is all about and what our calling is, at a time of trouble like this.\n\nKeller:\n\nMentioning Job is really helpful, because both Job and Jesus are the two places in the Bible where you see someone who\u2019s an innocent sufferer. Now technically Job being a regular human being isn\u2019t perfectly innocent. Nevertheless, Job didn\u2019t deserve, he didn\u2019t do anything to deserve that suffering. And Jesus when he went to the cross didn\u2019t do anything to deserve his suffering. But because both Job and Jesus were faithful to God without knowing why, but they didn\u2019t turn on God they stayed faithful. Again, Job was shaky. It\u2019s really remarkable to see how shaky he was, but in the end, he holds on. And in both cases, when you experience innocent suffering, and in spite of your questions, you still stay faithful to God, and do what you should do, it defeats Satan. In both cases, Satan is defeated because Satan basically says, \u201coh human beings, they just, they don\u2019t serve you, God, except for themselves. So unless everything is going well in their lives, they\u2019re not going to serve you.\u201d Satan says about Job, \u201cdoes Job serve God for nothing?\u201d Take away things and so what happens in the end if you are suffering even though it\u2019s innocent and you\u2019re faithful to God, you\u2019re defeating Satan. And you\u2019re learning, and you\u2019re also letting the suffering drive you like a nail further into God\u2019s love. And on the other end, you\u2019ll help people and you will actually find that you\u2019re closer to him even though you don\u2019t know the reason why just like Job did not know the reason why. He was never told. So I think Job and Jesus, two innocent sufferers defeating Satan just by being faithful in the darkness is a\u2026.they\u2019re very important models for us.\n\nCollins:\n\nI hadn\u2019t thought of that.\n\nStump:\n\nOne more aspect of this I\u2019d like to get you both to comment on is that the suffering seems not to be proportionally spread around in our communities, right? Francis on your NIH Director\u2019s Blog last week, you wrote and interviewed about the disproportionate deaths of minority populations. And I haven\u2019t seen that there\u2019s anything particularly biological to this right? Or is it just a reflection of our societal structures and our systems? And Tim, then I wonder if you might join in about the church and you mentioned Martin Luther\u2019s speech or his letter earlier about how the church may react during these times. Is there anything that the church can do in this particular societal situation we see, where the least of these are suffering more than their fair share in a time like this?\n\nCollins:\n\nWell, I can certainly say in terms of the bright light that this has shown on the dark situation of health disparities in this country is deeply troubling. We know health disparities are there. People have catalogued them. We know that certain illnesses are more common in people who have less in the way of resources, a lower socioeconomic status and so on. But COVID-19 has been ruthless in the way in which it has attacked those very individuals. In Georgia, where 30% of the population is African American, 80% of the people in the hospital with COVID-19 are African American. And it goes along with the health disparities that diabetes and hypertension are more common in those folks. And we haven\u2019t figured out what to do about that. It goes along with the fact that many of those people are not able to go home and stay at home safely, like I am now. Because they\u2019ve got to get out there and make a living, put food on the table. And so they are not being given the chance to protect themselves. And the consequences are devastating. And I don\u2019t think any of us who care about justice and equity and loving your neighbor can look at this situation and not be deeply troubled. And if this is a wake up call for our country and the way in which health abilities and equities are very unfairly distributed, well good for that. Maybe we need to remember this when the COVID-19 pandemic is over. And right now we need to do everything we can to reach out to those communities especially, even more so than those who have more resources.\n\nKeller:\n\nFrancis just went down the list of\u2026there\u2019s multiple reasons why the less economically resourced communities, for tons of reasons, are being harder hit. They live in smaller spaces. They live closer together. They don\u2019t live just in their apartments. They live around their apartments. They can\u2019t work from home. They also have more underlying bad health issues anyway because of their\u2026for various reasons. So he\u2019s gone through the list. You were asking about the church and that\u2019s a big question. Here\u2019s the reason why. Generally, you\u2019ll see that the upper middle class churches, where maybe the majority of the people can work from home, keep their jobs, versus the more blue collar and poor churches where most of the people are out of work, and where there\u2019s a lot more illness and devastation and unemployment in their immediate neighborhood. One of the problems is that the churches in those hard hit neighborhoods will not have the resources to reach out to their neighborhood at all, because like the majority of their own people are unemployed. The church might close up. They can\u2019t pay the light bills. Meanwhile, the churches that are in more, you know, posh and affluent neighborhoods are not going to have near as many needs in their neighborhood. And therefore there needs to be some kind of partnership between churches with more means, Christians with more means, and the churches in those hard hit neighborhoods, if they\u2019re gonna be able to respond. After 9/11, we knew that something like, I forget now the numbers it was so long ago, something like 17,000 small businesses south of 14th Street, instantly, literally went up in smoke. And there were hundreds of thousands of folks, many of whom were immigrants, who lost their jobs. And Redeemer was able to go into a major mode of helping people who had lost their jobs. Of course we didn\u2019t have the quarantine, we didn\u2019t have the distancing, social distancing, any of that stuff. Nevertheless, it was partly because people actually sent money to Redeemer from across the country, just saying, we\u2019re very concerned about New York, please help. Basically the situation was New York was much more hard hit the rest of the country was not that affected. People knew about Redeemer, sent us the money and we were able to really do it quite a bit. Something like that is going to have to happen, I think, with the more affluent churches with the churches that are in the harder hit communities if they\u2019re really going to respond to this.\n\nStump:\n\nAre there mechanisms that you see that are starting to be put in place that might help to facilitate that?\n\nKeller:\n\nI hear of them. I better not mention any because I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m, well\u2026 No, I know there\u2019s a\u2026 The game\u2019s afoot, as Sherlock Holmes would say. There definitely are people working on it.\n\nStump:\n\nOne more question you might both respond to about the image of God. The image of God is one of the most central doctrines of creation and I wonder how does this bear on our conversation here, both on the value of the least of these who are particularly vulnerable to the disease, but then also with respect to our duties and roles toward our fellow humans and the rest of creation, the image of God in us and how that might be imaged to the rest of the rest of the people.\n\nKeller:\n\nFrancis, go ahead, you first.\n\nCollins:\n\nWell, you could take that in a bunch of directions, couldn\u2019t you? I guess I\u2019m thinking as you raise the question about this debate about is it okay to take some risks about this pandemic by allowing people to be released from where they have been sequestered and quarantined, even if it means there may be more cases happening as a result. But after all, most of those are perhaps the older people or those with chronic illness, or perhaps somebody in a nursing home or somebody who\u2019s homeless, and maybe that\u2019s a trade off that we should basically except because we need to get our economy going again, Christians should be very careful of that one I think. Yes, the image of God applies to all of us. C.S. Lewis said if you could see any one of those individuals for what they really are as a spiritual creature, you would fall on your knees, even those that we consider the least of them. We of all people ought to be full of compassion and concern for every human being. And to consider that any of those might actually be something a sacrifice would be worth taking. That ought to give us a great deal of trouble. Now, I know I sound like one of those public health people who\u2019s not paying enough attention to the economic damage and I don\u2019t mean to say that\u2019s not been horrendous in terms of what it\u2019s done to people\u2019s lives and even caused health issues and even life threatening issues. That\u2019s true too. But let\u2019s be really thoughtful about what we stand for, which is the value of every human life, no matter who it is.\n\nKeller:\n\nOh, yeah, listen, I\u2019m just going to build on what Francis said. You know, I think the image of God does stop us from moving into what you might call a hard utilitarianism. Now utilitarianism is a school of ethics, you know, John Stuart Mill, that said, the greatest good for the greatest number. And therefore, if it means sacrificing a smaller number for the good of the whole, that\u2019s fine. Christians can\u2019t go there completely. I mean, when I say\u2026 It seems obvious that if everybody\u2019s in the image of God, then everybody\u2019s in the image of God, including the majority, not just the threatened minority. But nevertheless, it gets you\u2026it does mean that a single life is really very valuable and you really can\u2019t say, you can\u2019t do that hard utilitarianism.\n\nA quick example. I know, we probably don\u2019t have time. In 1884\u2014this really happened\u20141884, a British ship called the Mignonette, British, I forget what kind of ship it was, it sunk. There were four survivors and they were in a lifeboat together and they knew that they were not going to be able to survive, probably because they had no food and they were out of the currents, out of the trade winds, unless they were able to, you know, stick it out longer. So three of them killed and ate the fourth guy. Because the fourth guy was an orphan, had no relatives, no parents, no children. He was like 17 or 18 years old. All the others had wives, children, everything. And they sat down in a very utilitarian way, by the way, and said, you know, we\u2019re all going to die, unless he dies, and he doesn\u2019t have any\u2026 You know, basically it was a total utilitarianism. They killed them and ate him. And when they got back, by the way, they went to court and believe it or not the court exonerated them. Because at the time the utilitarian approach to justice was in the ascendancy. I think Christians would say sorry, that was not by his consent, he\u2019s a man in the image of God, has the right not to be killed and eaten. And that\u2019s hard utilitarianism. I still know that there\u2019s a such thing as calculus. Everybody knows, for example, if you shut down all the interstate highways in the country, there\u2019d probably be fewer deaths. And therefore there is some kind of calculus that goes on. It\u2019s at a very high level. But not at the level\u2026I don\u2019t want to do that utilitarianism right now with the virus. So that\u2019s what the image of God does. It does create a bit of a roadblock for people who want to be utilitarian and I would say we can\u2019t go all the way there.\n\nStump:\n\nAnd can you speak at all to the aspect of image of God of people who are in the position to make decisions? What does that mean that we bear the image of God for how we ought to treat people, not just that they themselves are in the image of God, but the duties that are upon us, in times like these.\n\nCollins:\n\nWell, we are called to be moral creatures, whether we acknowledge that or not, it is a universal sense that all of humanity has. And we recognize there are such things that are good and things that are evil. And it\u2019s a pretty interesting signpost to a creator God who cares about us, by the way. And it is very much on our shoulders to decide how to respond. As we are in the image of God, there\u2019s a lot of weight attached to those decisions. And I know for myself, I fail regularly with those decisions, which then brings me back to why it is a wonderful and amazing and a great comfort that I have Jesus as the Savior, who paid the price for all those times where I don\u2019t live up to the image of God. That makes it possible for me still to be a follower and a believer and to be in relationship with Almighty God, which is an amazing thing to say.\n\nKeller:\n\nI don\u2019t have anything to add to that. That\u2019s great.\n\nStump:\n\nLet\u2019s just close here. We\u2019re going to bring Deb back in. Several of our audience members are even asking how they might pray for the two of you. I think both of you have enormous followings and enormous respect from people that understand the pressures that you\u2019re under. And could you each, maybe just share a couple of specific ways that we could hold you up in prayer and Deb\u2019s gonna pray for us then at the end?\n\nCollins:\n\nTim, go ahead.\n\nKeller:\n\nWell, my part I think, because I\u2019m not the pastor of a church and because I do so many things when it comes to both writing, speaking, mentoring, training, teaching, I\u2019m going to have to replant myself. That is to say I have a lot of leeway as to what I do and I got to have the wisdom to know, in my last years here, because I\u2019m older, what\u2019s the best use of my time? And therefore it\u2019s going to take some wisdom to say what are the new realities and what\u2019s the best way for me to be of service? And actually, I feel quite a burden on that. I don\u2019t feel like I can just chug along do everything I\u2019ve always done. So I would say wisdom to know how to best use my gifts and spend my time in the years I have left.\n\nCollins:\n\nWisdom was where I was going too. At a time where there\u2019s so many decisions that have to be made about what\u2019s the right strategy to find answers to this terrible pandemic and I know I\u2019m making mistakes all the time by picking the wrong answer. But I am very fond of that verse from James chapter one, verse 5, \u201cif any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all without reproach, generously, and it will be given.\u201d I am glad that\u2019s the case. Because my wisdom is very insufficient for the challenges we have right now.\n\nHaarsma:\n\nWell, thank you both for all that you\u2019ve shared with us tonight, and for all of these wise words. And we do want to close here by praying for you, and by praying for all of us in this pandemic. So for every one of you join me in a moment of prayer.\n\nOh Lord, you are the creator. Your love is as big as the universe and you show that amazing love in Jesus Christ. You are the God who became human, who weeps with us and suffers alongside us even to the point of death. Help us to trust that amazing love and stay faithful in the darkness as Job did. Show your love this week to Tim and to Francis. Thank you for their dedication. Keep them safe and healthy. Give them your strength to persevere. And especially give your wisdom as you promised in James, you promised to give wisdom and my ask. Give them wisdom for the urgent challenges of today and the hard decisions for the years to come. Bless each of them as they continue to use their gifts so sacrificially. And Lord we pray you\u2019ll show your immense love to our world. For the sick, bring your healing mercy. Strengthen the health care workers. Guide the researchers. Guide the industry leaders to bring an effective vaccine soon. Into places of sorrow and worry and fear, bring your comfort and presence. Bring your church to show love and compassion. In places of confusion, misinformation and outright lies, bring your truth. Help us to be discerning in how we listen and speak your truth in love. And into places of injustice, where there are not enough resources, where people are suffering more because they\u2019re not able to isolate, bring your church in powerful new ways Lord. May your church be the place that unifies across race and income and geography to care for one another. Show us how to fight for every life, for every community, for every person who bears your image. We continue to pray with Psalm 46, \u201cOh God, you are our refuge and strength, an ever present help in trouble. Therefore, we will not fear. Though the earth give way we will not fear and though the mountains fall into the sea, we will not fear because the Lord Almighty is with us.\u201d Jesus Christ weeps alongside us. In your strong name Jesus, we pray. Amen.\n\nCollins:\n\nAmen, thank you Deb.\n\nKeller:\n\nThank you.\n\nCollins:\n\nThanks for a wonderful discussion and a conversation, Tim.\n\nKeller:\n\nThanks Francis.\n\nCollins:\n\nAlways good to have a chance to do this.

        "3. The sooner the better\n\nWidespread vaccination is the fastest and most permanent way to stop the spread. Nearly half a million people in the United States have already died of COVID-19 and millions more have been sick. Many others are struggling\u2014those who\u2019ve lost jobs, the lonely, those suffering mental illness, the healthcare workers serving on the front lines, and the teachers and kids dealing with online school. All of this will end as soon as we stamp out this virus! You can help your community by getting the vaccine as soon as you are eligible.\n\n4. COVID-19 vaccines are ethical\n\nMany Christians are concerned about the possible use of fetal cells in vaccines. The good news is that no vaccines contain human cells! Moreover, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do not use human cells even in the production process. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine does use a human cell line in production; this is an immortal cell line that came from a fetus aborted in 1985 (the abortion was not performed for this purpose). Yet even here, the cells used today are descended many generations from the original fetus and were never part of an actual human body. While the association with abortion gives many Christians pause, there is substantial agreement among Christian theologians and ethicists that the connection to fetal cell lines should not make these vaccines off-limits for Christians; see our Common Question on vaccines for more.\n\n5. The disease is riskier than the vaccine\n\nNo vaccine is 100% risk-free, just as no medical procedure is risk free. Christians need to weigh the risks on both sides. COVID-19 is a serious disease, much worse than the flu. By now we\u2019ve all known people who have had it. Some people have mild cases but others have serious symptoms, hospitalization, and long-term complications. The risks of the vaccine are less than the risks of the disease. Our Common Question on vaccines weighs the risks in more detail.",
        "Dictionary definitions change over time in response to how people actually use words. But they also serve as a standard for how we ought to use words now. So I have dictionary.com on my bookmarks bar and go to it several times per week to see if I\u2019m using a word correctly.\n\nOne of this week\u2019s sessions was to look up \u201cmiracle\u201d and see whether we can appropriately say that the COVID vaccines are a miracle. Here are the first three definitions given:\n\nan effect or extraordinary event in the physical world that surpasses all known human or natural powers and is ascribed to a supernatural cause. such an effect or event manifesting or considered as a work of God. a wonder; marvel.\n\nI think lots of people look at #3 and think, \u201cOK, maybe in a loose sense we can say \u2018It was a miracle that I passed that test\u2019 or talk about the Miracle on Ice when the US hockey team improbably beat the Russians in the 1980 Olympics. But those aren\u2019t really miracles.\u201d And even #2 looks suspicious when it says \u201cconsidered as a work of God.\u201d That sounds like saying the birth of a baby is a miracle and we may be grateful to God for it. But we know that biology explains that process pretty well. In the more precise sense, it\u2019s not really a miracle.\n\nIt\u2019s #1 that most people take to be the real definition of a miracle: it is beyond the capacity of nature, and we must invoke supernatural forces to explain it. In that sense, the incredibly effective and rapid development of the COVID vaccines are not miracles. They were developed by scientists in laboratories and adhere to perfectly explainable laws of nature.",
        "The vaccine is the key to our global recovery from the pandemic. But currently there exists a sizable number of Christians who have indicated they are suspicious of the vaccine.\n\nMy name is Curtis Chang, and welcome to Redeeming Babel, where our mission is to provide Biblical thinking in a confusing world. In this series, I want to take seriously the questions that some Christians have about the vaccine. But I want to make the case that after considering those questions, ultimately all Christians should indeed take the vaccine, and do so for important Biblical reasons.\n\nThere are several questions being asked by Christians. We will examine these questions in our other videos. However, I believe everyone starts with that first question, \u201cIs the vaccine safe?\u201d\n\nSo this video will focus on vaccine safety. If you can only watch one video, I recommend you too start with this one.\n\nSo, let\u2019s ask the question: \u201cIs the vaccine safe?\u201d\n\nI do believe the vaccine is safe. This is a major reason why I encourage all Christians to take the vaccine. But I think the way this question has gotten framed has unfortunately fallen into the division affecting our country.\n\nHow the question has been framed\n\nIn our divided society, each side is doing a great deal of eye rolling at the other side.\n\nThe \u201cYes\u201d side rolls their eyes at the \u201cNo\u201d side, and dismisses anti-vaxxers as \u201canti-science\u201d and \u201cignorant.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cNo\u201d side rolls their eyes at the \u201cYes\u201d side, and dismisses the majority as being \u201cSheeple!\u201d \u201cSheeple\u201d is a term used by some anti-vaxxers to describe people just mindlessly following conventional wisdom like sheep. \u201cThink for yourself!\u201d is the cry of the \u201cNo\u201d side.\n\nThe way this debate is framed is not accurate or fair to either side. For instance, it really isn\u2019t accurate or fair for the \u201cYes\u201d side to claim their side knows science and the \u201cNo\u201d side is just being ignorant.\n\nI\u2019m someone that is on the \u201cYes\u201d side. But if I\u2019m honest with myself, I have to ask, \u201cHow much do I really know the science of the vaccine?\u201d Yes, I\u2019ve read several news articles on the vaccine. But have I really mastered even the basics of the science involved? For instance, could I even name the chemical ingredients of the vaccine? No, I can\u2019t.\n\nCould I explain with any scientific detail why the vaccine attacks the virus but is somehow safe for me? If I actually tried, I have about 15 seconds of material and then I start mumbling. I have not read for myself any of the underlying scientific research papers on vaccine safety. And even if I did, I couldn\u2019t understand most of it. If I\u2019m honest, when it comes to the actual science behind vaccine safety, I\u2019m rather, well, \u201cignorant.\u201d\n\nSo, why do I believe the vaccine is safe? Well, the No side does have a point. It is not because I am \u201cthinking for myself\u201d in the sense that I am not depending on anyone else. In truth, I believe the vaccine is safe because I trust others tasked with answering that question for me. I trust the expert leaders of the scientific institutions like Dr. Francis Collins who heads the National Institute of Health (the NIH). Dr. Collins, by the way, is a devout evangelical Christian and one of the nation\u2019s leading scientists. Here are his words:\n\n\u201cAs NIH Director, I\u2019ve followed closely the development of these first vaccines, and I know they have been rigorously tested and found to be safe and effective. I encourage everyone to accept the vaccines when offered to you. It\u2019s our best chance to turn the tide on the pandemic.\u201d\n\nI have not \u201cfollowed closely the development of these vaccines.\u201d I do not know the details of this \u201crigorous testing.\u201d But Dr. Collins has, and I am trusting him. And not just him, but all the leading scientific institutions who agree with him on the safety of the vaccine. The FDA, the CDC, and all the major research institutions tasked with knowing about drug safety have assured us that the vaccine is actually very safe. And this overwhelming agreement by experts cuts across political divisions. Bioethics experts from conservative institutions like the Southern Baptist Convention and the Heritage Foundation have all encouraged people to take the vaccine as safe.*\n\nIn other words, the real question behind \u201cIs the vaccine safe?\u201d is actually the question of trust. The real question is: \u201cDo I trust scientific experts and institutions?\u201d\n\nAnd this means that what is going on for those on the No side is not that they are ignorant, but rather that they distrust the designated experts and institutions.\n\nSelf-examination for the \u201cNo\u201d side\n\nAnd this is where I invite the \u201cNo\u201d side to do a parallel self-examination.\n\nThere is a sense on the \u201cNo\u201d side that we are truly independent thinking people who don\u2019t just listen to the authorities tell us how to think. Rather we \u201cthink for ourselves.\u201d\n\nBut do we? Do any of us actually \u201cthink for ourselves\u201d in a consistent and complete way? When we go to McDonald\u2019s and order a Big Mac, are we inspecting for ourselves whether that particular piece of hamburger comes from healthy cattle, that it has been slaughtered in a sanitary fashion, that it didn\u2019t get contaminated somewhere in the long supply chain?\n\nOf course not. Every day, we are willing to inject many things into our own bodies because we trust the underlying institutions that have been tasked with knowing these things for us. We trust not just McDonalds, but a whole system of institutions behind it: its supply chain, government inspectors, the cattle industry, and many, many experts and institutions. Every day, we are all trusting in others. None of us fully \u201cthinks for ourselves.\u201d\n\nAnd here is the key Biblical truth that I want to emphasize: that is a good thing. That is the way God designed human beings and human life to operate. God designed us to navigate the world through trusting others, including trusting institutions and experts.\n\nThink about the Old Testament. Yes, some rare individuals get direct access to God\u2019s truth. But the vast majority of people in the Bible have to trust designated leaders: prophets, priests, kings. People have to trust entire institutions like the system of judges Moses appoints, the Levites, the Temple. In the New Testament, Jesus\u2019 all important Great Commission rests on his expectation that the entire world will trust the words of the few he has designated.\n\nGod has designed human knowledge to access truth about the world through trust. Why did God design human life in the world to operate this way? I suspect God did this as a way to build our trust muscles for ultimately trusting Him. If a person insists on being distrustful of everything and everybody, that person will become a fundamentally distrustful person. A fundamentally distrustful person will have difficulty trusting God. So, trusting in other human institutions is like faith training, building up our trust muscles for God.\n\nOf course, trusting human institutions does not mean expecting them to be perfect. Human institutions, like human individuals, have flaws. But just like we have to figure out how to trust imperfect individuals in our lives \u2013 like our spouses, our parents, our friends \u2013 and we also have to learn to trust imperfect human institutions.\n\nIf you lean on the \u201cNo\u201d side of the vaccine debate, I want to point out that you\u2019ve already learned to trust the very institutions that are telling you the vaccine is safe. Every time you buy some aspirin at the drugstore, you are trusting the FDA who oversees all drug safety. This is the same institution that has approved the COVID vaccine. Every time, you take a family member to the ER at your local hospital, you are trusting the NIH, the institution headed by Francis Collins who oversees health practices.\n\nYou already trust these institutions for yourself and your loved ones. Please keep trusting them as they tell you that the vaccine is safe.\n\nThe coronavirus has disrupted our world, caused enormous suffering of all kinds, and killed over 2 million people globally, and over 400,000 Americans. The vaccine is our best chance at ending this suffering and preventing more deaths.\n\nBut the vaccine does not have all the ingredients necessary to accomplish this. It needs one ingredient that only you can supply: this is the ingredient of trust. Let\u2019s add our part to the solution.\n\n*Additional institutions in support of the vaccine include The Center for Bioethics & Human Dignity of Trinity International University, Pontifical Academy for Life, American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American College of Pediatricians; Catholic Medical Association, and Christian Medical & Dental Associations.",
        "This event exemplified how Christians and the scientific community can work together to advance God\u2019s purposes and kingdom in the midst of the COVID crisis. Dr. Anderson, a pastor of a large, multicultural church in Maryland, shared some of his congregants\u2019 questions and concerns about the vaccine. Are the vaccines safe? Were people of color represented in the vaccine trials? Are the vaccines derived from aborted fetal tissues? Can you get the vaccine if you are pregnant or nursing? What will our social gatherings be like once we are vaccinated? Practical questions that were answered by the leading scientist in our country, Dr. Collins.\n\nAs I listened to these Christian men share their knowledge and expertise, I wished that my skeptical friends and family could have watched the live stream with me. I\u2019d love to have the opportunity to ask my friends and family questions about what they heard. Did any of Dr. Collins\u2019 answers resonate with them and alleviate some of their fears or concerns? And if not, what would it take to convince them that the vaccine was safe and effective?\n\nIn a time where many evangelical Christians do not trust the scientific community, events like this are key to re-establishing that trust. I am thankful for pastors, like Dr. Anderson, who act as bridge builders between the scientific community and their congregations. It takes courage to challenge peoples\u2019 suppositions, even when love is the motivation. I am thankful for Dr. Collins and all of the scientists who contributed to the development of the COVID-19 vaccine. God has gifted these men and women with wisdom and intelligence that I am in awe of. And I am thankful for the doctors, nurses, and aids who have been on the frontline of this pandemic, working long hours under extremely stressful situations.\n\nGod, in his amazing love, has provided us a way out of this pandemic. As I walked into the vaccine center last week to receive my first shot, I thanked him for the gift of this vaccine. Not only was I being provided with protection from this deadly virus, but I was contributing to the health and well-being of those around me. And in a small way, it was my contribution to ending the pandemic.",
        "Is the COVID vaccine the \u201cmark of the beast\u201d?\n\nIf you are not familiar with all the different strands of Christianity, this may seem like a strange question to you. But you may be one of the many Christians who is genuinely concerned about this question, and it is making you afraid of the vaccine.\n\nMy name is Curtis Chang, and welcome to Redeeming Babel, where our mission is to provide Biblical thinking in a confusing world. In this video, I want to explain why the COVID vaccine is definitely not the mark of the beast described in Revelation 13. I invite you to learn the reasons why I believe this so strongly, because doing so will help you read the Bible with greater knowledge and greater hope.\n\nReading approaches\n\nHow one answers the question, \u201cIs the COVID vaccine the \u2018mark of the beast\u2019 depends greatly on one\u2019s reading approach to the book of Revelation, the final book in the Bible. The Christians who fear the vaccine being the \u201cmark of the beast \u201c have been taught a particular reading approach: to read Revelation as a prophecy of \u201cthe end times.\u201d\n\nI actually grew up with this \u201cend times\u201d reading approach. When I was 10 years old, as a kid in Faith Bible Church in the Midwest, I was given a comic book version of a very popular book among Christians during that time called \u201cThe Late, Great Planet Earth,\u201d written by an author named Hal Lindsey. The book was influential in promoting the \u201cend times\u201d reading approach to Revelation.\n\nI remember very vividly the comic book illustrations of the \u201cmark of the beast\u201d passage. The drawing style made the world seem so ominous. I was afraid that some new technology in the world might actually be the \u201cmark of the beast.\u201d I was afraid that I might somehow get accidentally tagged by the mark. I was afraid that the end times were approaching. And I was afraid that the end times would happen before I got my first girlfriend. Seriously, I was really afraid of that!\n\nI no longer have those fears because over the years, as I have studied to become a pastor and now a seminary professor, I have learned to read that passage and the entire book of Revelation with a different reading approach. Let\u2019s call this the \u201cfirst century\u201d approach.\n\nNow, from my years of study, I do strongly believe that the \u201cfirst century\u201d reading approach is more faithful to the Biblical author\u2019s intentions.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m also aware from my own personal experience how many Christians still adhere to the \u201cend times\u201d reading approach. And like I said, I know firsthand how much of an emotional impression that the \u201cend times\u201d approach can make.\n\nIf that is true for you, I\u2019d like to invite you to just consider with an open mind the reading approach I\u2019m about to describe. Think of it like this: you\u2019ve been wearing one set of reading glasses. I\u2019m going to offer you to try another set on. If you don\u2019t think my version helps you see more clearly, you can always go back to your old one.\n\nWhen you\u2019re trying on new glasses, it\u2019s helpful to compare them side by side, to switch between the two and see which produces more clarity.\n\nI believe this side by side comparison can be characterized by the following:\n\nReading an x-ray versus reading a crystal ball Reading a compass versus reading a map Reading with hope versus reading with fear\n\nComparison #1: Reading an x-ray versus reading a crystal ball\n\nLet\u2019s start with the first comparison: Reading an x-ray versus reading a crystal ball\n\nHere is the actual passage about the mark of the beast in Revelation 13:16-18:\n\n\u201cIt causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name. This calls for wisdom: anyone with decent understanding should calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.\u201d Revelation 13: 16-18\n\nThe \u201cend times\u201d reading approach treats this passage like a crystal ball. In this approach, the author of Revelation was thousands of years ago gazing into the future, and predicting that some monstrous institution \u2013 \u201cthe beast\u201d \u2013 would force everyone to adopt some practice, one that is somehow associated with the number \u201c666.\u201d And that event would mark the nearness of the end of the world.\n\nThroughout modern history, some Christians have used this reading approach to claim that a particular institution of the day was the beast predicted by Revelation 13. The institution was usually one that the reader was already suspicious of in the first place. When social security was rolled out in the 1930\u2019s to political controversy, some opponents who were Christians labeled \u201cthe beast\u201d as the administration of FDR, and the \u201cmark of the beast\u201d was the assigned social security number.\n\nIn the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s, when giant telephone companies were seen as part of the shift from agricultural rural life to technological urban life, rural Christians labeled these companies \u201cthe beast.\u201d\n\nThey said the newly assigned three digit area codes were the three digit \u201cmark of the beast.\u201d The same pattern occurred with large financial institutions in the 1970\u2019s with the roll out of credit card numbers, in the 1980\u2019s bar codes and 1990\u2019s with computers and the Internet, in the 2000\u2019s with RFID technology that can track objects, and so on.\n\nAnd now, it\u2019s happening with the vaccine. The beast is the government, or the CDC, or some other institution. And the vaccine shot itself is the \u201cmark of the beast.\u201d There is even the false rumor that some sort of tracking feature is built into the vaccine.\n\nThe historical pattern of the crystal ball approach should alert us that something is wrong with this reading approach. With each crystal ball reading throughout the years, the end times does not occur as predicted. The predicted beast ends up not being that horrible. Yet, each generation keeps updating to another prediction, another match \u2013 again, with the match fitting pre-existing suspicions.\n\nThe Bible actually has very stern warnings about any one who presumes to offer any crystal ball reading. Deuteronomy 18:22 cautions:\n\n\u201cIf what a prophet proclaims in the name of the Lord does not take place or come true, that is a message the Lord has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously, so do not be alarmed.\u201d Deuteronomy 18:22\n\n\u201cSpeaking presumptuously\u201d means when someone is imposing one\u2019s own feelings, including one\u2019s own suspicions, on to God\u2019s word. Anyone who tries to read Revelation as a crystal ball is especially risking this judgment of presumption because the author did not write it for this purpose. Reading Revelation as a crystal ball is actually misreading the kind of literature the book is.\n\nRevelation is a type of first century literature that as the title suggests, is meant to \u201creveal.\u201d But what is being revealed is not primarily the future, but the spiritual meaning of the historic events happening in the first century world of the original audience. Revelation isn\u2019t talking about \u201cthe end times\u201d for most of the book: it doesn\u2019t get to anything close to that time horizon until the very last chapters.\n\nRevelation 1:4 makes it very clear the intended audience:\n\n\u201cJohn, to the seven churches in Asia\u2026\u201d Revelation 1:4\n\nThe intended audience is the seven first century churches in Western Asia. The next three chapters makes this even more clear as John, the author, reveals the spiritual condition of those seven churches at the time of writing. He is casting a spiritual X-Ray to show them what is really happening in their own congregations.\n\nIn the ensuing chapters, John then trains this spiritual X-Ray to the wider world. There is nothing to indicate that he\u2019s shifting time frames. He\u2019s just shifting to the secular world, to revealing to first century Christians the spiritual meaning behind those first century world historical events.\n\nAnd this is where the crystal ball approach gets off track: it misinterprets Biblical X-Ray language for what we think is crystal ball language. The type of first century literature that does this kind of X-Ray reading of world events routinely used extreme metaphorical language to describe the underlying spiritual realities. So Revelation is full of passages that describe the sky falling, the mountains crashing, the seas erupting with beasts. If read literally, these passages do sound ominous, like the world is ending. And that\u2019s why some Christians have assumed Revelation is making predictions about some future where the world quite literally ends.\n\nIt is helpful to remember that even today, we also use extreme metaphorical language to reveal the underlying spiritual or emotional reality behind significant world events. The virus has been described as an \u201cearth shattering\u201d event. The nation \u201cheld its breath\u201d for the presidential election results. Obviously, the virus did not physically break apart the earth\u2019s surface. Obviously, the entire country did not cease to take in oxygen for a week.\n\nWe have to read Revelation as using the first century version of such metaphorical language to reveal the spiritual and emotional realities of their first century world events. Since most readers aren\u2019t familiar with first century metaphors or first century historical events, we should approach Revelation with a trusted and accessible Bible commentary. I personally recommend N.T. Wright\u2019s Revelation for Everyone. Wright is probably the leading Bible scholar of the day and yet he writes in an extremely accessible and succinct fashion in this book. Also, our friends at The Bible Project have some excellent videos on this topic (and they\u2019re much less scary than my Hal Lindsey comic book!).\n\nComparison #2: Reading a compass vs. reading a map\n\nEven though I believe that Revelation cannot be read as a crystal ball, I can understand the attraction to this approach. The crystal ball approach \u2013 even if it is mistaken in my view \u2013 is nevertheless a way of making Revelation relevant to us today. If one only reads Revelation as revealing the spiritual meaning of first century world events, then what\u2019s the point of us reading it today?\n\nThis gets to a second reading comparison. To explain this difference, I\u2019m going to change metaphors a bit. I believe we have to read Revelation as a compass versus reading it as a map.\n\nWhen we are reading a map like this \u2013 and I realize that those of you under the age 20 may have never glimpsed such an object like this \u2013 we are making a one to one equation. This dot equals this specific town and this town only. This line equals this specific road and this road only.\n\nIf we want to read Revelation as a map making one to one equations, we have to do so with the first century world. We can do that with precision in the mark of the beast passage. It is historically documented that the first century Christians were under enormous pressure to conform to a growing practice of worshipping the Roman emperor. You can draw a one to one equation from \u201cthe beast\u201d to the Roman emperor: it was common for Scripture to use the metaphorical language of beasts to reveal the dehumanizing and vicious spiritual reality behind pagan rulers. Revelation makes that equation even more obvious by identifying the mark of the beast as 666. There was a common code in first century Hebrew literature that identified letters to numbers, and in that code, 666 translates precisely into the word \u201cNero\u201d \u2013 the specific Roman emperor of that day.\n\nSo, read as a map, the passage clearly wants the first century Christian to avoid bowing down to Nero and getting too closely identified with him. The language about getting branded with \u201c666\u201d is the metaphorical way of saying: beware that everyone in the first century world doesn\u2019t brand Christians politically. Make sure that everyone doesn\u2019t just assume Christians worship Nero like the rest of the pagan world.\n\nNow, if we want to discern the relevance of Revelation for our world today, we have to read the text differently. We have to read it like this thing: like a compass.\n\nA compass does not make one to one equations to a previously mapped world. Rather, a compass equips you to navigate your path in what may be an unfamiliar world. A compass gives you an orientation, a way to make your way in the world now before you. And a compass orients you by pointing you to the True North.\n\nNow, the two ways of reading \u2013 a compass and a map \u2013 are related. As we read Revelation as a map, we are seeing how the Biblical author was guiding the first century Christian church. We can trace God\u2019s intended route for them. The more we follow those first century routes, the more we end up with a compass, \u201cOh so, that is how God wants his people to navigate the world in general.\u201d\n\nSo, let\u2019s try to turn Revelation 13 from a map into a compass. We should beware of any one to one connection that confidently equates \u201cthe beast\u201d or \u201c666\u201d to any current political leader or current political identification. But we can read this passage as a kind of general orientation for Christians on how to navigate politics in our world.\n\nHere\u2019s my reading of the passage as a compass: I believe it is telling Christians in general throughout all ages, to navigate their political world by avoiding any complete and total identification with any political leader or party \u2013 whether on the Left or the Right. Don\u2019t bow down to any one leader. And as Christians, don\u2019t let yourself get politically branded, such that being a Christian automatically equals being a member of a particular political party \u2013 whether on the Left or the Right.\n\nThat\u2019s my version of reading Revelation 13 as a compass. You may of course discern your own version. I\u2019m sharing mine simply to offer an illustrative example of what is an appropriate way to rely on Revelation to navigate our current world.\n\nChristians can differ on the specifics of how different Biblical passages operate as compasses. But what all Christians should agree on is the True North. The most important way that a compass guides navigation is by pointing you to True North. And this leads to my final comparison. This is reading with hope versus reading with fear.\n\nComparison #3: Reading with hope versus reading with fear\n\nLike I said, the end times reading approach made me afraid of many things for many years. The tragedy was that causing fear is the exact opposite intention of Revelation. If you read passages like Revelation 13 as a compass, they are pointing to the final chapters of the book. This is when the book does shift its time horizon to the end. But it is the end, not of the very existence of the world, but rather the end of its struggles and suffering.\n\nThe final chapters of Revelation depict what has always been the Biblical picture of Christian hope for the world. Revelation 21:2-4 states it beautifully:\n\n\u201cAnd I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, \u201cBehold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. 4 He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.\u201d Revelation 21:2-4\n\nNotice that the end is God coming down from heaven to earth to be with humans and restore humanity. The end is not some devastating series of events. The end is not the destruction of the world. The end is the return of God \u2013 in the person of Jesus \u2013 back to this world. To dwell with us, to wipe away every tear, to end death and suffering.\n\nThis is our true North Star. This is the future that gives us hope for this world. Reading Revelation all the way to the end assures us that even when it seems like the world right now is captive to tears, death, and suffering, that is not the final state. As Christians, we have every reason to live as people of hope, not fear.\n\nFinal appeal\n\nThe priority of hope over fear is the reason why all Christians should stop fearing the mark of the beast. Even if you want to stick with an end times reading approach to Revelation, you should avoid interpretations that create fear in you.\n\nThis is because all Christians have been given something even better than a reading approach. We\u2019ve been given a personal reading guide. This personal reading guide is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is like a tutor at our side when we read Scripture, telling us, \u201cNo, don\u2019t read it this, read it that way.\u201d And how do you know when you are reading with the Holy Spirit\u2019s active guidance?\n\n2 Timothy 1:7 makes this clear:\n\n\u201cFor God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.\u201d 2 Timothy 1:7\n\nA Spirit guided reading leads you away from fear. Fear makes you feel powerless, suspicious (which is the opposite of love), and out of control. But the Holy Spirit seeks to give us a feeling of being empowered, being loved, and that things are under control.\n\nMost of all, the Holy Spirit points you to the True North, to the reassuring promise that our God will one day end suffering, disease, and death itself. This is why I believe that if you want to locate the vaccine in Revelation, don\u2019t equate it one to one with the mark of the beast. Rather, locate the vaccine as a hopeful pointer, a compass indicating God\u2019s promise that he himself will return one day to end all suffering and death.\n\nThe vaccine of course is just a pointer \u2013 it itself won\u2019t end all suffering and death for good. Only God\u2019s return to earth can do that. But pointers give us hope, they give us some indication of what is to come. The vaccine has the potential to do just that: to give us hope, to give an indication that there is an end to suffering and death.\n\nLet\u2019s follow that pointer. Let\u2019s be people not of fear, but of hope.",

        "Three years into the global COVID-19 pandemic, scientists are still learning more about how the virus impacts the body. Now, there\u2019s a new finding: COVID-19 is linked to brain damage.\n\nThat\u2019s the major takeaway from a new study published in the journal . For the study, researchers analyzed data from 401 patients aged 51 to 81 who underwent brain scans before they contracted COVID-19 and months after they were infected. Their scans, which were conducted about three years apart, were compared to those of 384 people who weren\u2019t infected with COVID-19, but had similar characteristics like age, sex, medical history, and socioeconomic status to those who did contract the virus.\n\nThe researchers noted that it\u2019s normal to lose some gray matter each year, which helps control movement, memory, and emotions. But patients who had COVID-19\u2014who had a second brain scan about 4.5 months after they were infected\u2014had more gray matter loss than those who didn\u2019t have the virus, losing between 0.2 and 2% extra gray matter in different brain regions between their two scans. They also lost more brain volume and showed more tissue damage in certain areas, including those linked to the sense of smell, than those who never had the virus.\n\nMost of the study participants were never hospitalized with COVID-19 (only 15 of them were), and the researchers noted that the trend in brain changes was still seen when the hospitalized patients were excluded from the findings.\n\nWhether you\u2019ve had COVID-19, love someone who has had the virus, or are just curious, it\u2019s understandable to have questions about what\u2019s going on. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nWhy might COVID-19 cause brain damage?\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear, but the researchers said in an FAQ they shared online that it seems to linked to loss of smell. \u201cIt is known that areas of the brain that are not being used can atrophy, so it will be important to understand how much of this may be related to loss of smell,\u201d says infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, who did not work on the study.\n\n\u201cAnother explanation could be the effect of the virus itself, either because it invades the brain, or because it causes inflammation or immune reactions,\u201d the researchers wrote. However, they added, \u201cit is still unclear why such invasion or inflammatory/immune reactions should be mainly seen in specific regions of the brain, but not others.\u201d\n\nWhat kind of symptoms can people experience from this?\n\nThe researchers didn\u2019t explore this. However, they did have study participants take cognitive tests around attention and efficiency in doing something complex. That showed that, on average, there was \u201clarger cognitive decline\u201d in people who were infected than those who were not infected, the researchers wrote.\n\n\u201cWhen you have inflammation in the brain from whatever cause, it can cause symptoms,\u201d says Santosh Kesari, M.D., Ph.D., neurologist at Providence Saint John\u2019s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., and regional medical director for the Research Clinical Institute of Providence Southern California. But Dr. Kesari says it\u2019s \u201cunusual\u201d to see changes in brain matter volume after having a virus. That, he says, \u201cmeans there's a pretty severe inflammation going on.\u201d\n\nThe actual symptoms depend on the area of the brain that\u2019s impacted, he says. But, given that this seems to be tied to areas of the brain that are linked to smell and taste, Dr. Kesari says it makes sense that the loss or change of these senses would be symptoms.\n\nAmit Sachdev, M.D., M.S., medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University, agrees and says that this can have big implications for people. \u201cSmell is important for taste and for threat recognition,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout smell, food can be very bland. Also, some safety measures that use smell to alert for a problem won\u2019t work. The most commonly cited example is being able to smell the \u2018rotten egg\u2019 smell added to natural gas. If you can't smell, you might not be able to detect a natural gas leak.\u201d\n\nCan COVID cause other neurological disorders?\n\nThis is still being explored. However, Dr. Adalja points out that COVID-19 has been linked to a few other neurological health conditions, including:\n\nNew loss of taste and smell\n\nStrokes\n\nPeripheral neuropathy (weakness, numbness, and pain from nerve damage)\n\nGuillain-Barre Syndrome (an autoimmune disorder where a person's immune system damages the nerves, leading to muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis)\n\nEncephalitis (inflammation of the brain that can be caused by a virus or bacteria)\n\nFatigue and body tingling can also happen as a result of COVID-19, Dr. Sachdev says, adding, \u201cwe have seen many patients with these long-term complications.\u201d\n\nHow long does COVID-19 affect the brain?\n\nThat\u2019s also unclear. The researchers noted that they have no clue how long these brain changes will last. \u201cWhether this deleterious impact can be partially reversed, or whether these effects will persist in the long term, remains to be investigated with additional follow up,\u201d they wrote.\n\nBut it\u2019s possible that people can regain at least some of their brain health over time. \u201cOnce damaged, the brain can recover but the recovery tends to be incomplete,\u201d Dr. Sachdev says. \u201cBrain injury is permanent. The area that is damaged can't regrow.\" Still, he says, \u201cbrain plasticity allows for some recovery.\u201d Dr. Sachdev says that it\u2019s possible that people can regain their sense of smell afterward \u201cbut that smell might not be the same as before the infection.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re still having unusual symptoms after having COVID-19, Dr. Kesari recommends seeing your doctor for an evaluation. But, he points out, doctors are still learning more about the after-effects of having COVID-19. \u201cThere is further work that needs to be done,\u201d he says. \u201cThere may be additional treatments to help the brain recover better, but we need more research.\u201d\n\nThis article is accurate as of press time.

Be sure to get the TRUTH by subscribing to our email list. It\u2019s free.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej and her boyfriend were in a private plane crash this Monday, June 27. They are both recovering in the hospital and doing well. Please keep them both in your prayers as they continue to recover and heal.\n\nCarrie has been a good friend to us and is a hero in the world sounding the alarm about the COVID shots and the transhumanism agenda the globalists are rolling out without our express knowledge through the COVID shot. If it weren\u2019t for Dr Carrie and others like her, we would be in the dark about the science and ingredients and their very dangerous effects on the human body. Thank you, Carrie, for your service to humanity.\n\nPlease enjoy this video presentation of Dr Carrie Madej speaking at our most recent TTAC Live Event 2021 in Nashville, Tn where she talks about \u201cThe COVID-19 Injections \u2013 A Gateway to Transhumanism?\u201d\n\nVIDEO TRANSCRIPT\n\nTy Bollinger:\n\nOur afternoon keynote speaker was originally from Dearborn, Michigan. She received her medical degree from Kansas City University of Medical Biosciences. She then completed her traditional internship at The Medical Center in Columbus, Georgia, and internal medicine residency at Mercer University in Macon, Georgia. She served as a private clinician and medical director of multiple clinics in Georgia till 2015, also served as an attending physician for the Pennsylvania College of Osteopathic Medicine.\n\nCharlene Bollinger:\n\nShe has served as a public speaker and has been featured in the documentary The Marketing of Madness about the overuse of prescriptions psychotropic medicines, and she has now dedicated her life in educating others about vaccine, nanotechnology, and human rights. She\u2019s become a good friend. I\u2019ve spoken with her on a few different occasions. She\u2019s a dear, dear soul, and I personally am looking forward to hearing our good friend, Dr. Carrie Madej.\n\nTy Bollinger:\n\nGive it up for Carrie Madej.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nThank you so much. It\u2019s so exciting for me to be here today. I\u2019m going to talk about obviously some ugly things that are happening in our world, but remember that we need to be wise as serpents and gentle as doves. And people get scared of the word apocalypse, right? But we shouldn\u2019t because literally the word apocalypse means lifting of the veil. We are seeing now what has been unseen. These ugly things that are going on right now are for a purpose. It is for us to finally remember who we are and what we are. It really is about returning back to who we are, which is we have a royal birthright, a divinity right with God, Yeshua, our savior.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo, transhumanism. If you don\u2019t know this word, you need to know it. Everybody in the world should know this because it is my belief that these injections they falsely call vaccines are the gateway to transhumanism and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going through this chaos. You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free, right? So let\u2019s get started.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nThe most important question you should ever ask yourself is what does it mean to be human? Because right now, the future of humankind is at stake. They want to turn us into something called human 2.0, and I personally am against it. So you need to know what is going on. So Ray Kurzweil, he\u2019s one of the big wigs of Google, he\u2019s a transhumanist. He says, we are all, not just a couple of people, we are all going to be a hybrid. This is the most pivotal point in human history. We are alive for this time. And I know I was born here to be for this moment, weren\u2019t you?\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo, transhumanism. What is that? That is literally the melding of artificial intelligence with the human body. Sounds pretty sci-fi, but it\u2019s doable and possible if we allow it to happen. It\u2019s also about manipulating the human genetics, that God-given code. So just so you know how precious your genome is, it is in one person, if you unraveled it, it would extend out to 10 billion miles, one human being. That is a wonderful living language. You can read it like a book. It can actually be read as a binary code.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nAnd so people now in this transhumanist field, they believe that the human body is broken and fragile. We\u2019re going to fix that. We\u2019re going to take evolving humanity into our own hands. These people right now think that and they are executing their plan. So this says scientists propose putting nanobots in our bodies to create a global super brain. Isn\u2019t it selling something from the worst sci-fi movie ever? We\u2019re living it right now, guys. So you can\u2019t get distracted by what the television is telling you. It\u2019s tell a vision. It\u2019s programming you. Turn it off, never turn it back on again and you will become smarter already.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo again, Ray Kurzweil, we all know this man. He says, we\u2019re just a few breakthroughs from achieving eternal life. Again, what these people are doing, listen, they are atheists. They do not believe in God our Father in heaven. They will tell you that. Even Ray Kurzweil says, somebody asked him, \u201cIs there a God?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, but soon there will be one.\u201d Craig Venter, another transhumanist, they asked him, \u201cWhat is God?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, God creates. Now, I can create, we can create. Now we\u2019re gods.\u201d You need to know those are the pushers of this agenda. They are the pushers of these injections falsely called vaccines.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo you have to know what they plan. They have a plan for human bodies as you can see here, avatar A, B, C, D. So this is an evolution of going up to 2045. They actually kind of pushed this agenda to 2030, eight years from now, guys. So they want to actually\u2026 They think a human being is only memories and dreams. That\u2019s it. Because again, they don\u2019t believe in God. So they think if they upload all of our memories and dreams into the cloud, then they can download them into a new body or robots or a digital avatar like a video game. You have to know what they\u2019re thinking. I know it sounds ludicrous, but you need to know.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo who else is behind this? World Economic Forum, Davos. And if you really want to know what they\u2019re planning, look at the World Economic Forum\u2019s websites. So this is what they\u2019ll tell all of us that 2030 is their goal, guys. So in 2030, it says the average human will own nothing, have no privacy and life has never been better, right? They also say on the bottom paragraph here, they\u2019re giving you the description of now, this is their best sell. They\u2019re marketing this to you, okay? They say that in the future, everywhere you go will be registered, there\u2019s no privacy, and every thought and every dream is recorded and monitored. And you hope that none of those dreams, none of those thoughts go against the narrative or you\u2019re in trouble. You will be in trouble for what you dream of. These are these megalomaniacs behind this plan. They plan this for the future of humankind.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo these are very outrageous ideas. So how in the world could they accomplish this really almost eight years now? So you have to know about DARPA. Very important organization to know, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. They\u2019re the black ops, the sci-fi kind of portion of the Pentagon. They have public and private funding. And so one of the things you need to know is this substance called hydrogel. Hydrogel is like the mother kind of formula. It\u2019s a sci-fi substance that can do many things. Actually it\u2019s very analogous to the human tissue. So we usually don\u2019t reject it in the body. It can assemble, disassemble, reassemble innumerable times. It can make more of itself in your body. It can meld with the human tissue and be a hybrid with your body, your brain, and your nervous tissue. They\u2019ve used it in military projects already.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo just so you know, an example of that would be, there is a small group of Black Hawk helicopter. It was a project. And when they sat in the aircraft, they\u2019d have to wear a magnetic helmet. And at that moment, all their eye movements and everything they thought, the aircraft would know immediately to do in respond. The aircraft and the person, the pilot was one. And if they had an upgrade, they didn\u2019t have to study. They just sat in the cockpit and then it was downloaded into their brain. They\u2019ve been doing this for decades. So Neil deGrasse Tyson, he\u2019s an astrophysicist, is talking to Ray Kurzweil, the guy we\u2019ve been talking about. So listen to what he says.\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson:\n\nIn 20 years, plus or minus, and so the mid 2030s, we will have nanobots that we can feed into our brain that directly connect to the cloud rather than through anything we carry in our pocket. And in that way, wirelessly, we can basically download entire books, entire languages, and we will then know the\u2026\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nI\u2019m sorry. All right. Sorry, that cut off a little early, but you\u2019re talking about nanobots. So hydrogel, that magical substance can form nanobots. It can be a drug delivery system. It can be biosensor. It can be a biosensor in your body. So how in the world could they get nanobots in our body? How could they upload everything? How could they know our thoughts? How could they know our dreams? How could they monitor everything? How could this happen? Because they\u2019re doing it right now through these injections falsely called vaccines and they\u2019ve been lying to us from the beginning.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo it is not a vaccine. Never call it a vaccine ever again any of these shots they\u2019re giving to anybody, all right? It\u2019s a brand new technology on the human race. It\u2019s nothing like an old vaccine. Old vaccine takes the actual virus and it\u2019s dead or alive with some toxins, puts it in your body, and your body\u2019s supposed to know how to fight it just a little bit amount, right? No, there is no virus at all that they have documented. There\u2019s over 70 freedom of information acts. Do you know we don\u2019t have the virus on file anywhere in the world? Nobody has it in their lab. This is a little crazy, right? So they couldn\u2019t make the normal way. They had to make a Frankenstein code so that your body produces this. They took proteins, they took this genetic code and mashed it together and had an artificial intelligence program fill in the missing gaps. So it\u2019s artificial intelligence, a synthetic thing that\u2019s not from nature and different kinds of parts of genetic material pushed into one and they are programming your body to make it like a factory.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nWhat\u2019s in the code? We know a little bit. We know that there\u2019s a human protein similar to the body so your body potentially could start attacking itself. It\u2019s so similar. Like autoimmune disorders. HIV-1, did anyone know that? Is that informed consent here? 18 sub-units of HIV-1 are in that code that your body will be producing. What will that do? Chromosome 8 is pretty important. It\u2019s in charge of intelligence and fertility. It\u2019s a potential damaging that. Most important, they\u2019re putting a fake amino acid in your body, not from this world. That beautiful symphony orchestra of how your body is created with that genome that twist and turns, it\u2019s beautiful from God, they\u2019re destroying it with a fake protein. It\u2019s like origami. It won\u2019t twist and fold together again.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nThis guy you need to know, Dr. Craig Venter. Never forget that name. This man is behind this transhumanist movement. He\u2019s the brains behind it. And I want you to know that if we have a synthetic gene, which this vaccine has\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, injection has synthetic genes in it, if it gets taken up into our human genome, that\u2019s bad because in 2013 in this country, the Supreme Court justice has ruled that any human being can be patented and owned if there\u2019s a synthetic gene inside of them. What? Did you know that? Was that on your CNN, your Fox News? No. Literally overnight, you can be patented and owned. This guy is partly responsible for this.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo they didn\u2019t want you to know there was a synthetic gene inside this injection because it\u2019s possible for it to take up into your body. And if it\u2019s taken up, they decided to get credit for their work. They\u2019re so proud of this. Again, they think they\u2019re little creators. They\u2019re gods, right? So they\u2019re putting their names branding you like a cow. 46 scientists are doing this. They\u2019re getting a secret email inside the genome. I guess that\u2019s who you belong to if someone finds you. Also three messages. Can\u2019t figure out those messages yet. Working on that. And also a brand new alphabet. Why alphabet?\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nRemember they want to be gods or copying God, but it\u2019s a blasphemy, an inversion of God, okay? They want you to live forever. They want you to always be connected through a hive mind. And also we\u2019re connected with God, right? So frequencies. Like you\u2019re tuning on a radio, they want to switch the channel. They want to switch the station because words are powerful. Remember in the beginning there was the word. Yeah. It\u2019s powerful, guys. See what they\u2019re doing? We know what they\u2019re doing, right? So they\u2019re not going to get away with it.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nAnd so this is going back to, yes, the Supreme Court has ruled that a human being can be patented and owned if this synthetic gene gets taken up into your body. And they\u2019re telling us it can\u2019t happen. Absolutely it can happen. They\u2019re lying to you. Absolutely. Right here, this is the modified messenger RNA that they\u2019re using inside of these injections, and this is just one of many research articles showing that our body has the potential to use reverse transcriptase enzyme. Long word. It can take it up into the genome of our genome and then it becomes permanent. It\u2019s a Russian roulette. It\u2019s a chance. It\u2019s like playing Craps. We shouldn\u2019t be doing that with our sovereignty, with our human holy temple, right?\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo Moderna and Pfizer. So everybody tells me, \u201cOkay, I know some of those injections are bad. Okay. Well, what about this one? What about this one?\u201d No, they\u2019re all bad, guys. They\u2019re all putting a fake code inside of your body. Something not from nature that you are producing like a factory. And you know how they\u2019re doing that? They have to suppress your immune checkpoints. They have to suppress your immune system so your body accepts it. For how long will that happen? That means more cancers, more autoimmune disorders, all kinds of things. Do you think they cared? No. They just want their drug inside of your body.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nThey also are putting artificial intelligence inside your body. Unbelievable. But it\u2019s just to get the drug delivery system in. So the hydrogel is part of this artificial intelligence system. And they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, well, we\u2019re not going to use it for bios and we\u2019re not going to do it to spy on you. Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re just going to put it inside your body just for the drug delivery. But once it\u2019s in your body, don\u2019t worry. We won\u2019t use it for anything else.\u201d Do you believe that? They are liars. They lied from the beginning. We know by Dr. David Martin that\u2026 We know where the coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, came from, right? It\u2019s patented 2002. There\u2019s a patent. That means it was made in a lab. Someone\u2019s making money off of it. We know where it came from. It\u2019s not from some bat soup shop, whatever, in China. It\u2019s a lie.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo all of them are the same. Some of them say they\u2019re doing different things. Sometimes they\u2019re using a vector. Vector means they\u2019re using a cold virus that is infecting you purposely and then it\u2019ll inject this genetic material inside of you. Some are just using the hydrogel, right? They\u2019re telling us they\u2019re doing different ways. And I knew this, but I wanted to see it with my own eyes. I don\u2019t trust them, right? And I\u2019ll show you some photos. So Moderna also says that it\u2019s trying to put an operating system inside of you. An operating system just like Windows. We know Windows is terrible. Viruses all the time, right? They messed up on that. How are they going to make this one good? Impossible. And were you given informed consent? Have they told us about this? No. They\u2019re liars. Again, this is the theme. They\u2019re lying. Satan is the greatest of deceivers, right?\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo with this hydrogel, different things come under hydrogel, nanobots, graphing, magnetic particles, et cetera. But that\u2019s the mother of all of that substance. And just to FYI, hydrogel is the opposite of water life. We\u2019re over 90% water. Water gives life. It freezes when it\u2019s not supposed to freeze. When it freezes, it expands instead of condenses, something very strange. It boils when it\u2019s not supposed to boil. It makes different crystal structures depending on intention, where it comes from. It\u2019s beautiful. It has intelligence in life. Water\u2019s life. Hydrogel is water gel. It sucks the life out. It literally will dry out the water. That is not healthy for any human body. And they want to put nanobots inside of you just like this.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nAnd how could they do that? Well, one little syringe needle, one little syringe needle, 1 million can fit in there. And this is one of the symbols of hydrogel. You want to see how it moves inside? This could be assembling, disassembling, reassembling in your body to do innumerable tasks, do innumerable things. I want to show you another nanobot. This is called a TRAP bot, okay? I actually have seen images of this in the vial, somebody whose vials we\u2019re injecting into people.\n\nSpeaker 5:\n\nOrganization-based microrobots or TRAP bots which can capture and transport live cells to a desired location. Much like a spider weaving a web, these microbots can spit out thread-like gel to trap living cells and incorporate them in their hollow microcylinder. This microcylinder is about 200 micrometers in diameter. It also contains the ingredients for these cell trapping gel, which creates a long thread-like structure while [inaudible 00:19:17] allows for magnetic-\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nOkay. So this is just giving you an example of how it can move through the body and what is directing the movement? A magnet or magnet force, a magnetic force. And it\u2019s very minuscule, but I don\u2019t know if you noticed what they\u2019re saying. There\u2019s a long string-like, hair-like substances gel, hydrogel, coming from it that builds, it can actually build and grow as it\u2019s squirming through the body. Hydrogel is also important to know because it can create its own electricity, okay? Think about to build a computer, you need some power. You need electricity. So we are powerful beings, A, and now the hydrogel can produce its own electricity. But remember computers when you have a laptop on your lap and it\u2019s been working for a while, it gets really hot. They have to cool down. So the problem is when something is generating a lot of computing power, how do we cool it down? Oh, don\u2019t worry. Hydrogel can cool itself down. They\u2019ve already thought about this.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nAnd just so you know, hydrogel in a injection with Moderna, Pfizer, et cetera, they\u2019re calling it nanolipid particle. So nanolipid particle is a creative way of saying the same word as hydrogel just so you know. Again, DARPA has their clarity project with hydrogel, and what they\u2019re saying is that they\u2019re so good at it when they inject it into the human body in some of their military experiments, they were able to mold it and make it a hybrid tissue with the brain and the nervous system of the military victim. And so when they did that, they could see through and feel and know what that soldier is thinking like an avatar. Use them as computer simulation game. And they think this is great. So this guy you need to know, he\u2019ll explain about the technology.\n\nSpeaker 6:\n\n[crosstalk 00:21:23] the sensory cortex of the second animal and that animal acquires the knowledge. From the human drone technology standpoint, you can attach the human brain to another human brain, you can direct motor activity, or you can send communication and information. Dr. Venter\u2019s work is in my view, the equivalent of the development of nuclear weapons when you realize that he created life in a cell. He programmed yeast cells to produce anything he wanted. These can be inserted into you through the hypospray needles. You put in a specific gene slicing, you program what you like, you put it in the cell and it can reproduce and make as much as you like. It sends a signal and it tells which portion of the DNA should unwrap, unfold, and produce a product.\n\nSpeaker 6:\n\nRelated to this is an idea called DREADDs. These are designer receptors that can be remotely controlled. You can create a cell, you can put it somewhere in the body and you can remotely activate it. So you have the capacity to create any product as long as you know the DNA sequence, you can insert it into a living system and you can remotely control it. That may affect the way you think, the way you act. So once you know that the technology is there to edit, splice, and program the cell and the technology currently exists to administer to somebody and have it go park anywhere you program it to go park proliferate and do its function, you can have things activated in other people\u2019s brains.\n\nSpeaker 6:\n\nThese people have figured out how to hide imagery in the DNA of bacteria. You can have the information reproduced in a string form as a form of a protein. The new way to hide information is going to be in DNA. This is the first experiment showing what imagery you can hide in bacteria. This is the latest. It\u2019s a GIF file. Well, this is what the Chinese are doing with DNA. Merging DNA systems with quantum computing will be really quite an amazing and both lethal threat. The next thing I wanted to mention to you is memory. Can we erase memory? Can we modify memory? Can we change memory? Of course the short answer is yes.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo I want you to know the brief thing of this this guy works with is bioweapons with this kind of nanotechnology. And he\u2019s saying what they can is do this kind of substance like the hydrogel, okay? And they can use it for multiple purposes. They\u2019re so good at it with these nanobots. They can rewrite your memory. They can erase your memory, put a new memory inside of you. If you have this substance inside of you that they could do all these things, do you trust them when they say it\u2019s just a drug delivery system. Don\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t trust them. I don\u2019t trust them at all. They can make new memories. They can send an impulse into the body and make you feel something, make a toxin produced, make a neuropeptide produced. There\u2019s no good thing. There\u2019s no God-given reason why anybody would do that to another human.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nAnd just so you know, you might\u2019ve seen this, patent 2020/060606. Do you think they picked 666 by accident? People have marketing departments, I know, and they know that we have a visceral reaction to 666. We have a contact tracing act, 6666, right? Moderna has ingredients with a number 0.666 or 6.666. This is not accident guys. Symbolism is everywhere. Pay attention. They use symbolism and they will tell you who they serve. And here they\u2019re showing the person as a little tiny speck, that\u2019s you or me, and then there\u2019s a device, which is your cell phone or my cell phone, and then you are wirelessly connected to your cell phone. How does that happen? They have to have a substance inside of you to make you wirelessly connected to everything. It\u2019s called the internet of bodies, the internet of things. And so how do they do that? You have to ask yourself. They want to do it by 2030. They have to make you a walking Wi-Fi electronic device. They can do it with the hydrogel or the nanolipid particle.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nAnd just so you know, Gates loves this kind of thing because they can hijack your brain when you\u2019re sleeping or just reading the magazine because they can do computing power in the background like a computer and they\u2019re going to make money off of you and you didn\u2019t know it, right? If you accept this technology inside of you. They also want to use it with social credit system of China. I\u2019m kind of speeding through some of these things just because I want to get to the pictures of what I saw inside the microscope.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nBut let\u2019s say you don\u2019t believe what I say. That\u2019s fine. Just know that Bill Gates does. His company in West Africa, along with MasterCard, along with Trust Stamp and artificial intelligence program have combined forces. Since July, 2020, they\u2019ve been experimenting on the people there. Giving them the same shots we have here. Same technology. They are giving them a barcode or a numeric number. Each one is unique. Everything\u2019s downloaded, their medical records, their vaccination records, and their ability to do commodity is also downloaded, downloaded into their body. Doesn\u2019t that sound like something from the book of Revelation? And if they don\u2019t accept it, they\u2019re locked out. It\u2019s a war on cash.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo since they have this technology inside the people, what Bill Gates said, he\u2019s like, \u201cWell, since we already have the hydrogel nanolipid particle inside of you, we\u2019re also going to start using it for surveillance and predictive policing.\u201d Just like I warned you about. They\u2019re doing it to the people right now like the Tom cruise Minority Report. They say once it\u2019s perfected there, all developed countries will get it. That\u2019s you and me too guys. What do they call it? Wellness pass or a vaccine passport. This is why we fight, this is why we say no, this is why we do not comply.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nAnd so I talked a lot about this, right? And how did I even get to know about this? Well, if some of you heard my story, you\u2019ll know that at some point of my career, I was recruited. They thought I would be a good person on their side. I was recruited to business owners meetings in Metro Atlanta, as well as scientific meetings where I got to meet Dr. Craig Venter, okay? And so in these meetings, they talked about this whole transhumanist movement and how it was great. We would be the controllers in the room. Don\u2019t worry. We would be exempt. Everybody else would be controlled. I was horrified. I was horrified to see everybody standing ovation and clapping for this. Like who are they? And I asked, \u201cHow could you be for this?\u201d They said, \u201cOh, well, it does sound a little bad, but you know what? Carrie, soon it\u2019s going to be us or them. And so we have to. You\u2019re going to want to be on our side. You don\u2019t want to be on the other side. It\u2019s going to be bad.\u201d\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nI said, \u201cI would never do that. And you\u2019re a fool. You\u2019re a fool to think that this technology wouldn\u2019t be turned back on you because we are human beings, right?\u201d And they have a super computer that wants to guide all of this. A computer doesn\u2019t care who you are. It has an algorithm. You have a dollar sign in your head. Sound like the Marines, all for one, one for all. Computers sees it as foolish, frivolous, right? So I had all this knowledge. That\u2019s how I got to know how to research for it, but I was still not happy. I\u2019m a person. I have to know, right? So I decided I\u2019m going to look at inside of these vials, even though it\u2019s not legal, I don\u2019t care because if something goes against my God-given rights and my human rights, it is my duty to break that law.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nThis is our world, our planet, our children, our bodies. Don\u2019t give it away. It\u2019s ours, right? So this is one of the pictures of Moderna. I put two drops on a glass slide. I had a compound microscope. That\u2019s it guys. You could get it easily. 300 bucks. And I had a white light going up on the middle and a glass top on the very top. And that\u2019s it. I waited two hours and it was translucent at first then all of a sudden colors appeared. Vibrant purples, blues, reds, greens. I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this chemical reaction.\u201d There was no chemical reaction, right? So I ended up finding out all these colors, actually, when they appear under a white light, that\u2019s a sign of a super conducting material inside these injections. All the manufacturers have that. What that means, it\u2019s proof they\u2019re putting an injectable computing system inside every single one of these vials. An injectable computing system. Did they say anything to any of us? No.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nThere\u2019s little cubes on this one. Were just showing some of these photos. Here\u2019s another one. It\u2019s hard to see on this photo, but at the very edge, there\u2019s a cube-like structure. We\u2019re not quite sure exactly what that is right now. So also I saw a lot of metallic flex fragments. I didn\u2019t see anything about metal fragments on the ingredient list again. And these metallic fragments to me look a little more exotic. It\u2019s not like your typical aluminum, et cetera, right? This one is strange. It\u2019s so opaque. It leaves its own shadow. Some of these pictures are between 100 times magnification, which is nothing, to 400 up to 600 times magnification. This is not nanotechnology. This is not looking at nanotechnology. This is at a much grander scale. This is crazy.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo this picture kind of has been going around I think. I\u2019m going to give you a close-up of him. This was on the first slide I did and there\u2019s the cover slip, right? So everything gravitated to the very edges of the cover slip. That\u2019s where I saw a lot of action. There was a lot of aggregation. There is self-assembling. This is two hours. It\u2019s not like 12 hours. Two hours time. I also saw this thing. I was shocked. It actually was able to lift itself up off of the glass slide. You can\u2019t see it? Okay. It was able to lift itself up off of the glass slide. It had tentacles like you see here. It was able to move. It is my opinion and it is my interpretation that it was self-aware. I\u2019ve never encountered anything like that. I\u2019ve done slides, I\u2019ve done all kinds of preparation of slides of biologic materials, et cetera. Never have I witnessed anything like that.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nAnd so I did cry. I cried. And then I thought, well, okay, perhaps that was a fluke. Surely maybe some contamination, right? So two months later, I get another Moderna vial and I look at it under the microscope and here\u2019s\u2026 What is that? Still trying to figure it out guys, but we shouldn\u2019t have unidentified objects inside of these injections. Another of these string-like material, I\u2019m like looking I\u2019m like, \u201cThis almost looks like some kind of a living organism.\u201d And then I see another one. And then I cried hard. You may not know what that means. I do. These are parasites better made to meld with your nervous tissue. Imagine a child that is forming their neural network. I want you to feel what I feel. I want you to get that righteous anger. We need it now. No more.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nJust on a side, if you know the book of Revelation, does it kind of look like a scorpion? Guess what else it can do. The tentacles, it\u2019s called Hydra vulgaris. The tentacles have the ability to give a paralyzing, a venomous or a toxic reaction. Wow, it sounds like something else that I read, right? Why would they want that? Well, Hydra vulgaris is actually a organism, and I don\u2019t know what that is, it\u2019s an organism that is immortal in the lab. It can continually renew itself. If you chop it up into tiny pieces, put in a petri dish, it will actually self-assemble itself back over and over and over again innumerable times. It\u2019ll make itself anew. If you chop off a tentacle, three more will grow. And the transhumanists love this organism. They think it\u2019s fantastic. Again, that was 100 magnification, I\u2019m sorry, the last one. So this is the edge of the cover slip. There\u2019s a lot of debris kind of grapheme-like material. And then we start to see a lot of ring structures in here.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nNow, this one is with the Johnson & Johnson vial. Let me get to the\u2026 So, again, ring-like structures. What they are is they appear to be delivery systems. So they\u2019ll start like this and they get bigger, bigger, bigger. They fend themselves out. A gelatinous material extrudes from it like a hydrogel, okay? And then this was like a bundle of cells growing. What are those cells? We don\u2019t know. We need to analyze them. What kind of cells are being injected into people? A crystalline structure, little crystals. Like literally, this is like a kitchen sink, dirty kind of a experiment going on. These are iridescence silicone-like wafers. If they pile on top of each other, they can make their own circuitry boards. Hydrogel it\u2019s a gelatinous material here. Again, more hydrogel with more of these spheres, these rings. So I saw them at all the manufacturers, all of them. So no one is different than another. I don\u2019t care if they come up with a new one, guys. Don\u2019t ask me if it\u2019s safe to take it. They\u2019re all bad.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo I was very fortunate to work with Project Veritas recently. So bravo, right? They\u2019re amazing patriots. Another round of applause. So they will be releasing their findings soon. I worked with them. And so we were looking under the microscope at Pfizer vial and they have documentation to share too from a brave whistleblower. So anyway, this is a Pfizer vial. You see a lot of these dark particles. These are like graphene oxide particle material. So what we were witnessing over time under the microscope was something called Teslaphoresis. Have you heard of that? So what that means is that you can put all these little tiny beads, let\u2019s say, that have the potential to make their own wiring in the body. And what you do is you could just have an external magnetic force or another kind of electric force, let\u2019s say, or frequency, and they will start to form and coalesce into a string-like spider web all by themselves.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo you just have to put the junk in somewhere, turn on a frequency and voila, it starts to make its own neural network, a string-like consistency. We were seeing it here inside of this vial starting to coalesce, starting to form structures. It\u2019s a little bit difficult to see, but up there, if I can do a pointer. Can\u2019t see my pointer. Anyhow, there\u2019s a [inaudible 00:37:55] kind of figure in the middle. So if you knew what a human nerve cell looked like, a dendrite, it would look just like this, but this isn\u2019t from a human guys. This is from whatever they\u2019re injecting inside of you. Literally, this is my opinion, they\u2019re trying to put another kind of nervous system inside of you, but an AI kind, or they\u2019re hijacking this parasite to put inside of you. These are my hypotheses. I encourage you to do your own research. And for the people who don\u2019t believe me, under the microscope, you can get a $300 microscope and you can put the drops on there and you can look and see the pictures too, right?\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nSo this is another organism. We see this over and over. This would be like a Polypodium or a Hydra vulgaris organism. Again, we see this over, over, over. It\u2019s not a mistake. It\u2019s in different states, multiple vials, multiple batches, multiple times. There\u2019s no mistake. Another one. This is very similar to some ectoderm of a parasite. We could go on and on, parasite after parasite looking\u2026 And let me back up. They appear to be parasites, right? If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, it probably is, right? Again, more ring-like structures.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nHow is this in the betterment of humanity? Is this why ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine are so banned from everybody? Right? Now we know. I want you to see this guy. This guy is another organism that we saw. This was in a Johnson & Johnson vial. Watch closely the translucent thing that moves around the edge of the ring. Do you see that? At first I thought it was another\u2026 Let me back up and do that again so you can see. Okay. Oops, I\u2019m going to try to do this properly. Okay. All right. Play. Ah, sorry guys. Anyway, it\u2019s a translucent\u2026 I thought it was like a larvae, like another life form, but the way it moved was more robotic to me. This could be a nanobot. We don\u2019t know. I\u2019m showing you pictures. And I think you don\u2019t have to have a science degree. You don\u2019t have to have a medical degree to know that should not be in any human body injected into to our children, our babies, and us.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nI want to show you this. We had a healthy blood of a young man, put a drop under the slide. It moved normally, right? Every time we added a drop of the injection from the Pfizer vial, this organism formed, which looked just like the coronavirus. You know what? It wasn\u2019t in the vial by itself. It wasn\u2019t in the blood. Only when the blood and the injection, or I\u2019m sorry, the contents of the vial hit together, that formed. I want to hypothesize that this structure they\u2019re calling the coronavirus is inside these vials. It\u2019s a hypothesis that\u2019s saying, we need to look into it.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nI want you to see how much\u2026 This is one drop of Moderna. One drop. One drop. Look at the movement. It\u2019s not normal. They tell you they\u2019re putting living organisms inside of you. This is just more graphing kind of a substance. Hydra vulgaris, look it up. UC Davis loves this against the transhumanist movement because of all of this. And it\u2019s kind of funny they like to say hail Hydra. Have you heard of that before? Symbolism is everywhere. Watch for it then you\u2019ll know who they serve. Just more about the hail Hydra and its life forms, but I like to always see symbolism, right? So the grown version of this Hydra is called a medusa and the Hydra also means many headed serpent. Wow, I read that before on the book of Revelation. This is just showing how they can chop it up and put it into a vial and then it can grow itself again once it\u2019s in its host.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t hear you. I\u2019ll go back. Sorry about that. Okay, got it. Is that good? Okay, got it. Okay, this slide was just to show you that maybe one may not be Hydro vulgaris. Maybe it\u2019s Nematostella or Acropora. Okay, my point is it comes from the same family. They all can do the same things, okay? We can go into splicing hairs later, but this is just to show you that they all can do this. And so my warning to you is this is a picture. It says a thousand words, right? And I want to shock you. I want to make you have emotion and passion because that\u2019s what we need right now.\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nAnd people ask me, \u201cWell, how did this happen and how do we get out of it?\u201d Why we got here it\u2019s one reason. We disconnected ourselves from God, our Father in heaven. God did not leave us. We love God. We need to make that right. These are praying and worshiping and putting God first in everything and remembering who you are and what you are. You are royal birthright. You have a divinity inside of you, a light that God gave every single one of us if you choose to connect with it because we have free will, right?\n\nDr. Carrie Madej:\n\nIf you haven\u2019t read on Jesus Christ, you should because he gave us the instructions on what to do right now. With God we are unstoppable. We are powerful beings. We don\u2019t have to be afraid of any of this technology because with God, we have this force that in a blink of an eye, we change it all. And you just don\u2019t know who you are yet. And I\u2019m here with you because I\u2019m here to remind you who you are. And for my last breath on this earth, I will fight with you and for you and for the world and for our children. There\u2019s nothing greater in this world. Thank you. [inaudible 00:45:01].\n\nTy Bollinger:\n\nDr. Carrie Madej. Wow, that was amazing. That was amazing. I was watching that for quite a while from the back and blown away with a lot of that stuff. A lot of the stuff I was not even aware of though. Thank you Dr. Madej.\n\nEnd Transcript\n\nDr. Carrie Madej is originally from Dearborn, Michigan and received her medical degree from Kansas City University of Medical Biosciences in 2001.

        "Numbers have a certain mystique: They seem precise, exact, sometimes even beyond doubt. But outside the field of pure mathematics, this reputation rarely is deserved. And when it comes to the coronavirus epidemic, buying into that can be downright dangerous.\n\nNaturally, everyone wants to know how deadly COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, is.\n\nWe know, irrefutably, one thing about the coronavirus in the United States: The number of cases reported in every chart and table is far too low.\n\nThe other problem is, now that the U.S. appears to be ramping up testing, the number of cases will grow quickly. Public-health officials are currently cautioning people not to worry as that happens, but it will be hard to disambiguate what proportion of the ballooning number of cases is the result of more testing and what proportion is from the actual spread of the virus.\n\nPeople trust data. Numbers seem real. Charts have charismatic power. People believe what can be quantified. But data do not always accurately reflect the state of the world.\n\nThe reality gap between American numbers and American cases is wide. Regular citizens and decision makers cannot rely on only the numbers to make decisions. Sometimes quantification actually obscures as much as it reveals.\n\nJust a day ago, an example of how WHO manipulate the numbers regarding U.S!\n\nBelow you have two screenshots from WHO official website, the first part is from: March 22, 2020, 17:44 GMT; the second one: March 22, 2020, 21:30 GMT. Decide yourself!\n\nThe first part:\n\nThe second part:\n\nPlease do not forget: Protect yourself and your family!\n\nTake care of your health and protect others by doing the following:\n\nWash your hands frequently\n\nRegularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.\n\nWhy? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.\n\nMaintain social distancing\n\nMaintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.\n\nWhy? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.\n\nAvoid touching eyes, nose and mouth\n\nWhy? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.\n\nPractice respiratory hygiene\n\nMake sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.\n\nWhy? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.\n\nIf you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early\n\nStay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.",
        "Even as Vice President Mike Pence wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published Tuesday that coronavirus cases in the U.S. \u201chave stabilized,\u201d a document produced that same day by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and circulated to the other government agencies warns that infections in the U.S. have increased more than 18 percent.\n\n\u201cCases have stabilized over the past two weeks, with the daily average case rate across the U.S. dropping to 20,000 \u2014 down from 30,000 in April and 25,000 in May,\u201d Pence wrote Tuesday in his op-ed, which defended President Trump\u2019s response to the pandemic.\n\nYet the CDC\u2019s June 16 COVID-19 Response Update appears to paint a darker portrait of the state of the pandemic, with maps showing many counties in the U.S. experiencing increasing rates of the coronavirus. Of the figures highlighted, a chart shows that the U.S. rate of increase for the coronavirus using a three-day average is 18.3 percent. By comparison, two of the hardest-hit countries have declining rates based on this same three-day average: Brazil\u2019s cases came down 27 percent, and Russia\u2019s have decreased by almost 7 percent.\n\nNeither the CDC nor Pence\u2019s office responded to a request for comment. Pence remains the head of the White House coronavirus task force, which has all but faded from view in recent weeks. The task force\u2019s last public briefing was in late April, though its members still meet regularly.\n\nIn a press briefing Friday, June 12, CDC Director Robert Redfield indicated that some of the increasing case numbers result from more widespread testing at facilities that have had large outbreaks, such as nursing homes, prisons and meat-processing facilities, but even that is \u201cnot explaining everything.\u201d\n\nThe CDC update is marked as an \u201cinternal\u201d government document, meaning it is not intended to be released to the public. Yahoo News obtained a copy of the report, which was distributed within the government the same day Pence\u2019s op-ed was published.\n\nThe explanatory text accompanying the CDC maps also appears to contradict Pence\u2019s optimistic message about the coronavirus. \u201cThere remains a large number of counties whose burden continues to grow or are in an elevated incidence plateau, including in Wyoming, Iowa, Washington, California and in parts of the Southwest and Southeast,\u201d the CDC document reads in a caption accompanying a map showing large swaths of the country as either in \u201celevated incidence\u201d or \u201crebound\u201d for coronavirus cases.\n\nA separate map showing the number of new cases notes that \u201celevated incidence of disease during the past 2 weeks remains widespread, including in the Northeast (and the New York City area), the Southwest, the Southeast, DC, areas around Chicago, and parts of California, Minnesota, Iowa, Washington.\u201d\n\nPence\u2019s op-ed also appeared on the same day the Wall Street Journal ran an article based on an interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s top infectious disease expert, who sounded a far more pessimistic view about the country\u2019s progress than the vice president.\n\n\u201cPeople keep talking about a second wave,\u201d Fauci told the newspaper. \u201cWe\u2019re still in a first wave.\u201d\n\nFauci also disputed the idea that testing alone accounts for the recent rise in U.S. cases, a claim regularly made by President Trump.\n\nDespite the divergence regarding whether COVID-19 cases in the U.S. have \u201cstabilized,\u201d Pence and the CDC appear to be in sync when it comes to figures showing significantly declining death rates. Pence wrote that \u201cin the past five days, deaths are down to fewer than 750 a day, a dramatic decline from 2,500 a day a few weeks ago \u2014 and a far cry from the 5,000 a day that some were predicting.\u201d\n\nAccording to the CDC documents, death rates have declined by about 22 percent, based on the prior three-day average. New deaths are down to 646, even lower than Pence noted, though the average number of new deaths, the CDC document says, is at 829.",
        "Bill Gates made some stunning admissions recently and said that COVID affected mostly elderly people and had a low fatality rate. He said it was a lot like the flu.. Jimmy Dore pointed out that the average age of people who were diagnosed as dying from COVID was above the life expectancy rate. Gates also admitted that COVID \u2018vaccines\u2019 do not block transmission.\n\nAnalysis from Jimmy Dore:\n\nWhile Jimmy Dore subscribes to the virus theory of COVID, he does make some important points, including the fact that the average age of people who supposedly died from COVID is over the age of life expectancy!

        "From naturalnews.com:\n\nThe founders of a new online campaign \u2014 #CanWeTalkAboutIt \u2014 hope to break the culture of silence around COVID-19 vaccine injuries by encouraging people injured by the vaccines to share their personal stories.\n\n(Article by Michael Nevradakis republished from TheEpochTimes.com)\n\nLaunched last month with a live online \u201cLet\u2019s Talk\u201d webcast, #CanWeTalkAboutIt brings together the vaccine-injured with medical experts willing to speak out about the risks of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe campaign also seeks to help people injured by the vaccines network and locate resources and information in their own countries and communities.\n\nIt also invites them to submit a black-and-white photo, with their right sleeve rolled up, wearing a band-aid to symbolize that they got the vaccine, and share the post, with a short description of the injuries they experienced, on their social media networks with the #CanWeTalkAboutIt hashtag.\n\nIn an interview with The Defender, Agnieszka Wilson, one of the founders of the campaign, said she became aware of questions surrounding the safety of various vaccines after sustaining a probable vaccine injury \u2014 rheumatoid arthritis, which she developed after she got the Tdap vaccine \u2014 during her pregnancy.\n\nThis incident led her to discover the silence that often accompanies vaccine injuries.\n\n\u201cIf you take a headache pill and you see that there\u2019s a side effect that makes your skin blue, then you obviously might say \u2018okay, it might be from that, right?\u2019\u201d Wilson said. \u201cBut when it comes to vaccines, you can\u2019t really talk about these things.\u201d\n\nWilson said that the silence led her to do her own research on vaccine injuries.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I dug into this whole new level of silence that I didn\u2019t know about, regarding vaccines,\u201d she said.\n\nWilson said that she wanted to do more than just conduct her own research. She wanted \u201cto do something about it,\u201d she said \u2014 which led her to start the New York Medical Freedom Coalition when she lived in the U.S.\n\nAfter returning to her native Sweden, Wilson launched her own interview program, the \u201cAga Wilson Show,\u201d on which she interviews doctors and scientists.\n\nThrough this program, Wilson became aware about the looming risk of injuries related to the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nShe also noted silence on the part of the mainstream media and a reluctance from ordinary people to speak openly about such issues.\n\n\u201cWe all heard and knew that the rollout [of COVID vaccines] was starting and we were going to see a lot of damage done by these vaccines,\u201d Wilson told The Defender.\n\n\u201cBut people were really scared, and especially [scared of] being associated with \u2026 organizations that were stamped as anti-vax organizations.\u201d\n\nShe added:\n\n\u201cWe all also knew that media was silencing it. These people were denied that these were vaccine injuries [but] we were seeing all of these things happening. So I thought, we need to do something, we need to start making people aware that these are actually dangerous vaccines.\u201d\n\nWilson\u2019s interviews with experts and her discussions with people injured by the vaccines led her to realize \u201chow completely excluded they are.\u201d\n\nWilson said:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no disease in the world where you cannot talk about it \u2026 you can talk about cancer, you can talk about any kind of disease out there, but not this.\n\n\u201cThey have scientists that are willing to do research on this, scientists from the big institutions, and they\u2019re just being ignored.\u201d\n\nThe media is complicit in this silence, she said. \u201cThere\u2019s something more going on than just this. Why is media being silent? Why are we not talking about this?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a drug in history that has had so many side effects and no one is talking about it,\u201d she said.\n\nWilson\u2019s concerns about the side effects, silence on the part of doctors and scientists, and the media\u2019s complicity led her to start the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign.\n\nShe said:\n\n\u201cI always work globally; I thought now we need to do something globally, we need to do a campaign that\u2019s going to start breaking the silence around this issue because people need to know.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want any more people to take the shot, especially after what I\u2019m seeing in all of these groups.\u201d\n\nBrianne Dressen, who was injured by the AstraZeneca vaccine during its clinical trial, got involved with the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign soon after its launch.\n\nDressen, whose non-profit organization, React19, offers \u201cfinancial, physical, and emotional support for those suffering from long-term Covid-19 vaccine adverse events globally,\u201d told The Defender the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign resonated with her.\n\nDressen said she was not only compelled to speak out, but also to help others do the same. \u201cSpeaking out, especially in today\u2019s climate, is especially difficult.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe injured largely trust other injured,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have been exploited and used so many times by people who just don\u2019t quite take the time to understand the impact they can have on us and our health.\u201d\n\nDressen described the situation as a \u201cdouble whammy\u201d for the injured, as they \u201chave been censored and stripped of any ability to have a voice by one side, and when we do speak out, many times the tone from those who wish to use our stories is tone-deaf, dehumanizing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, the injured clam up and huddle together in support groups with only each other,\u201d Dressen said.\n\nCampaigns and support groups such as #CanWeTalkAboutIt play an important role in amplifying the voices of people whose individual ability to be heard or to enact change is limited.\n\nDressen said:\n\n\u201cThis campaign, in large part due to the simple and appropriate messaging, was able to strike the appropriate balance for the injured to feel confident enough to speak out. It was also a way for the rest of the world to see us move in unison across the globe.\n\n\u201cIt is challenging for sick people to fight for ourselves. Our energy is extremely limited. So instructions and campaigns need to align with not only our personal values but with our ability to physically tolerate the stress of the advocacy work being asked of us.\n\n\u201cIt is important that compassionate messaging and respect be there in order for us to feel safe enough to speak out and share our stories.\u201d\n\nThe culture of silence described by Wilson and Dressen extends to social media, where specific keywords are frequently censored by the platforms.\n\nDressen said the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign took into account this reality in its planning.\n\n\u201cWe already knew what words were going to get shadowbanned, so the strategy was to come up with messaging that sends the right message without outright using these words,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI am very careful with my own messaging through our non-profit [React19] to ensure messaging is forward-thinking, has a positive slant. Instead of \u2018STOP\u2019 or \u2018DON\u2019T,\u2019 we use \u2018pro-safety,\u2019 \u2018pro-informed consent,\u2019 etc.\u201d\n\nWilson told The Defender the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign has three primary objectives, the first being to provide the vaccine-injured with visibility and a voice.\n\nShe said:\n\n\u201cPeople are being bullied \u2026 for being vaccine-injured, and no one believes them. So we tried to \u2026 create a safe space for these people to speak their stories, but also for others.\n\n\u201cHow do we involve the public in this? We want others to support them. That\u2019s why there\u2019s two sides of the campaign. One is for them to tell their stories, but the other is for people to actually acknowledge them and see them because they\u2019re not being seen.\u201d\n\n#CanWeTalkAboutIt also aims to give the public the ability to make an informed decision regarding the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cThe second [objective] is to raise awareness publicly so that people understand the risks with the vaccine and hopefully make an informed decision,\u201d Dressen said.\n\n\u201cInformed consent is not being given in the situation and the doctors are also not doing their job when it comes to swearing the oath \u2018do no harm.\u2019 So we want people to be aware.\u201d\n\nFundraising is the campaign\u2019s third objective, according to Wilson, with the purpose of \u201csupporting all of these organizations out there that are doing the work to find solutions for the vaccine.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign has partnered with a number of organizations, including Children\u2019s Health Defense Europe, the American Health & Freedom Coalition, the World Freedom Alliance, the World Council for Health and Millions Against Medical Mandates.\n\nThe campaign also collaborates with local and country-based groups \u201cthat already have their communities in place.\u201d\n\nOne of the goals of these local partnerships is to help the vaccine-injured find support groups near them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pulling together those groups \u2026 because we want to build communities right on the website as well, so that people can find each other,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nNetworking is just one of the components of the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign, according to Wilson. The campaign also wants to host more live webcasts, like the June 17 inaugural event.\n\nAccording to Wilson, the event brought together \u201cfive experts and five injured, who \u2026 shared their stories and shared what they have been through in terms of adverse events or adverse reactions,\u201d allowing for a discussion with the experts on these issues.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing was that this conversation is so needed and we need to continue it because we need to do more research, more surveys,\u201d Wilson said.\n\n\u201cWe need to have people tell their stories so that the experts can understand what is going on. \u2026 We will continue having webinars more focused on specific topics so that we can get to the bottom with this and also support the campaign.\u201d\n\nBy sharing the stories of the vaccine-injured, campaigns such as #CanWeTalkAboutIt can help such individuals avoid continuously recounting their stories and reliving an event that may have been highly traumatic for them.\n\nWilson said:\n\n\u201cWe need to understand the trauma that these people are going through, and listen to them. Our job really is to ask them how we can create a safe space.\n\n\u201cSome of them \u2026 don\u2019t want to tell their stories over and over again. It comes back to their trauma and they relive it, while others who are the spokespeople are actually the ones who maybe are more comfortable doing that.\u201d\n\nAnother challenge faced by the vaccine-injured is that their concerns are frequently dismissed by doctors.\n\n\u201cNot only are they not being heard or \u2026 the doctors are not listening, but basically they\u2019re not getting help,\u201d Wilson said, citing this example:\n\n\u201cWe had one Swedish woman who was part of the webinar and she was telling us how she just goes from one doctor to another and they just keep sending her back and forth and no one can tell her what\u2019s going on.\n\n\u201cPeople have a very hard time because they just keep being dismissed. A lot of them are being sent home, [told] that they have anxiety, even though they have severe symptoms which could not be explained by just anxiety.\u201d\n\nDressen, who experienced adverse events within an hour of receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine on Nov. 4, 2020, told The Defender how doctors dismissed her.\n\n\u201cWithin the first year I saw close to 40 doctors, and had well over 60 office visits, a trip to the NIH [National Institutes of Health], and several hospital stays,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was plagued by an \u2018anxiety\u2019 diagnosis for six months until I was able to go to the NIH. NIH confirmed it was post-vaccine neuropathy, and one internist confirmed the same after the NIH made the initial diagnosis.\u201d\n\nThis \u201canxiety\u201d diagnosis came despite a broad array of symptoms, Dressen said:\n\n\u201cMy reaction started within an hour of my shot and was tingling down the same arm as my shot. From there my health declined over the next 2.5 weeks with double and blurry vision, sound sensitivity, tachycardia at rest, sweating, brain fog, dissociation, limb weakness, internal vibrations (that still haunt me to this day), confusion, vibrations in my brain, tinnitus, hair loss, severe nerve pain, etc. I had well over 30 symptoms.\n\n\u201cI ended up in the hospital because my legs stopped working. I remember my husband standing over my bed begging my medical teams to just run one more test, look at one more thing. Without him, there is no question I would be dead.\n\n\u201cI was sent home with in-home physical and occupational therapy to recoup my legs, retrain my bladder and learn how to do simple tasks like sort a box of toys \u2026 and a diagnosis of \u2018anxiety.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nSeveral of these symptoms continue to the present day, according to Dressen.\n\n\u201cI still have well over half of my symptoms: leg weakness, neuropathy, tinnitus, POTS [postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome], internal electrical feelings. But the sound sensitivity and light sensitivity are gone,\u201d she said.\n\nDressen pays $1,100 out-of-pocket every two weeks for intravenous immunoglobulin.\n\n\u201cThis is just one medication I need to stay alive,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has impacted my life financially, physically and emotionally. My family\u2019s life and finances are now dramatically different.\u201d\n\nDressen\u2019s injuries \u2014 and her experiences with doctors \u2014 led her to testify before Congress, testify before a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel, and participate in a press conference of vaccine-injured individuals organized by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI).\n\nAccording to Dressen:\n\n\u201cMy message to lawmakers is pretty simple: after being to the NIH for research and after participating in dialogue with the heads of the FDA for over a year now, I know the government simply is not doing their job.\n\n\u201cWe did our part. We did what we were told and were assured over and over that if something were to go wrong that there would be a safety net. But instead of a safety net, there is a huge gaping hole.\n\n\u201cHow long do the injured need to wait before these health agencies do their job? People are suffering now, they are dying now, they are out of work now. They can\u2019t wait 5, 10, 20 years for the intentionally slow wheel of government process to move forward. The pace we are going right now, progress is so miniscule that we all will be dead before the government makes this right.\u201d\n\nThis slow and ponderous pace is, in part, due to \u201cspecial interests, lobbyists and a whole lot of money,\u201d Dressen said, which \u201chave corrupted the process by which individuals like myself can attain proper medical care, engage in research on pharmaceutical harms and receive proper \u2014 or any \u2014 compensation.\u201d\n\nFor Dressen, the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign can play a role in pressuring governments and public health agencies to do the right thing.\n\n\u201cThe #canWeTalkAboutIt campaign is an effort to bridge that gap between these many sides and provide a neutral and independent place for those who are ready to listen and learn.\u201d\n\nWilson told The Defender that she would like to see the social media campaign of #CanWeTalkAboutIt get bigger, \u201cso that we can actually go viral and \u2026 [inform] the public that this is a serious issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are millions of people suffering from vaccine injuries from the COVID-19 vaccine,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe need people\u2019s help to share so that we can reach out to the masses and warn them that there are huge risks with taking this vaccine.\u201d\n\nDressen\u2019s message to the vaccine-injured is that \u201cyou\u2019re not alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever give up, never give in,\u201d Dressen said. \u201cThere is one thing this community has that is unlike anything I have ever experienced and it is an enormous ability to love and support one another.\u201d\n\nShe added:\n\n\u201cFor those who are still trapped in their beds just trying to hang on by the hour or by the minute? That little bit of love and compassion could be the difference between life and death.\u201d\n\nFor Wilson, the phrase \u201cstrength in numbers\u201d applies to those who are vaccine-injured.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to reinvent the wheel,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe just want people to be able to know who\u2019s out there doing what and where the vaccine-injured can find protocols, communities, to educate them.\u201d\n\nWilson added:\n\n\u201cWe need more stories. We need to understand what\u2019s going on in order to do our job. So we want to bring together everyone under this campaign to start collaborating \u2026 and support one another, to really have a bigger impact.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for us to come together and organize better because we\u2019re stronger together. And that\u2019s how we can actually make an impact.\u201d\n\nWilson said the #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign also wants to raise funds to research vaccine injuries because governments aren\u2019t doing it.\n\n\u201cWith this many vaccine injuries, it\u2019s mind-boggling and absolutely unacceptable for the government and the medical establishment not to go into studies,\u201d she said.\n\nDressen expressed a similar sentiment regarding the responsibilities of governments toward the vaccine-injured, and the advocacy role campaigns such as #CanWeTalkAboutIt can play in promoting the reform of existing vaccine compensation programs.\n\n\u201cHHS [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services] needs to address the failing, under-powered and under-funded compensation program,\u201d Dressen said.\n\nShe added:\n\n\u201cSimilar to the [Vaccine Injury Compensation Program] vaccine tax that requires drugmakers to pay into a fund to pay for injuries, Washington can draft legislation that will require these drugmakers to pay a similar minimal tax into a fund for independent research on the potential harms of their products. The taxpayer should not have to foot the bill for this research.\u201d\n\nSuch efforts can also target the coordinated actions of social media platforms and other entities to classify any news about vaccine injuries as \u201cmisinformation\u201d and to subsequently quash it.\n\nDressen said such practices do not just stifle free speech, they also cause material harm for the vaccine-injured.\n\n\u201cThe word \u2018misinformation\u2019 is a powerful weapon that divides and dehumanizes,\u201d Dressen said.\n\nThe #CanWeTalkAboutIt campaign can bring the public into the mix, by providing \u201ca neutral and independent place for those who are ready to listen and learn,\u201d and also by empowering the public to drive change without waiting for governmental bodies to act, Dressen said.\n\n\u201cThe tools to fix this are not just the responsibility of the government. We The People have the power and obligation to unify and demand change. And when that change doesn\u2019t happen, it is our job to enact change.\u201d\n\nShe added:\n\n\u201cDivided we fall. But together, our voice is powerful and can drive change. But in order to do that, we must listen and learn first. Can we talk about it?\u201d\n\nYour Tax Free Donations Are Appreciated and Help Fund our Volunteer Website and Orphanage",
        "DEBORAH BIRX UNMASKED \u2013 I BET YOU HAVEN\u2019T HEARD THESE STORIES ABOUT THE SCARF LADY\n\nFrom Alexandra Bruce of Forbidden Knowledge\n\nAmazing Polly is back with proof that former Army Colonel Dr. Deborah Birx is a key member of the genocidal Big Pharma junta currently attempting to take over the world \u2013 plus some stories you might not know about the evil scarf lady.\n\nPolly traces Birx\u2019 involvement in the HIV/AIDS depopulation agenda since her earliest days in the 1980s at Walter Reed and under Fauci at NIH, through her days overseeing George W Bush\u2019s President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program [slush fund] to support HIV/AIDS programs in 65 countries. She was the United States global AIDS coordinator for Barack Obama and the White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator on President Donald Trump\u2019s White House Coronavirus Task Force from February 2020 to January 2021.\n\nBirx is now testifying that she knew all along that the COVID-19 vaccines wouldn\u2019t work and she has essentially admitted under oath and in her book to subverting the US government and tricking the world in multiple ways while serving on the COVID-19 Task Force.\n\nIn attorney Michael Senger\u2019s scathing review of Birx\u2019 new book, \u2018Silent Invasion\u2019, he says\n\n\u201d Virtually every page of Birx\u2019s monstrosity of a book, Silent Invasion, reads like a how-to guide in subverting a democratic superpower from within, as could only be told through the personal account of someone who was on the front lines doing just that\u2026every sentence of Birx\u2019s book reads like it was written by the CCP itself. \u201c\n\nFor nearly 40 years, Dr Birx has been the public face of the HIV/AIDS agenda, of which Bill Cooper describes the early history in Chapter 9 of his seminal 1991 book, \u2018Behold a Pale Horse\u2019.\n\nThe Death Shot is the latest outgrowth of this same HIV/AIDS agenda and the culmination of a project that has its roots in the late 1950s, when aristocratic European Bilderberger bankster types, appalled by the postwar Baby Boom and the ascendancy of the US commissioned studies and computer models from the Club of Rome, to show that around the year 2000, there would be a total collapse of civilization and that the only things that could stop it would be severe cutbacks of the human population, the cessation of technological and economic growth, the elimination of meat in the human diet, etc., etc.\n\nWe know these initiatives today as Agenda 2030 and the Great Reset. Bill Cooper says Henry Kissinger strongly supported these ideas and the Global 2000 Report to the President prepared for Jimmy Carter was based on this Club of Rome data.\n\nIts author, Aurelio Peccei baldly recommended that a\u201cA plague be introduced that would have the same effect as the famous Black Death of history. The chief recommendation was to develop a microbe which would attack the autoimmune system and thus render the development of a vaccine impossible.\u201d\n\nCooper says the result wasProject MK-NAOMI, and the bioengineering of HIV, which was carried out by Special Operations Division scientists at Fort Detrick, Maryland under the supervision of the CIA.\n\n\u201cMK\u201d is a CIA cryptonymindicating the sponsorship of the CIA\u2019sTechnical Services Staff (TSS).\n\nAs we know, COVID-19 and the related vaxx contain the same GP120 spike protein found in HIV, whichDr Richard Fleming, PhD, MD, JD tells us (concurring with Bill Cooper) is a US bioengineered bioweapon.\n\nOf course, one of the main things the vaxx does is that it give you VAIDS \u2013 vaccine-induced AIDS.\n\nBill Cooper told us back in 1991 that:\n\nFunding was obtained from the U.S. Congress under H.B. 15090 (1969), where $10 million was given to the DOD\u2019s 1970 budget. Testimony before the Senate Committee revealed that they intended to produce \u2018a synthetic biological agent, an agent that does not naturally exist and for which no natural immunity could have been acquired. Within the next 5 to 10 years it would probably be possible to make a new infective microorganism which could differ in certain important aspects from any known disease-causing organisms. Most important of these is that it might be refractory to the immunological and therapeutic processes upon which we depend to maintain our relative freedom from infectious disease\u2019\u2026 The New World Order will eliminate the population threat in several ways. Complete control of individual behavior may be established using electronic or chemical implants. No one will be allowed to have a child without permission; stiff penalties wait for those who ignore the law. The violent, the old, the infirm, the handicapped, and the unproductive will be killed. Private property will be abolished\u2026Technological development and economic growth will be severely cut back.\n\nWe are now living everything Bill Cooper described thirty years ago. People like Deborah Birx and Anthony Fauci have been doing public health theater for the past 40 years, pretending to be solving health crises when in fact, they were creating them at the center of the genocidal program that is currently underway.\n\nYour Tax Free Donations Are Appreciated and Help Fund our Volunteer Website and Orphanage",
        "by Brian Shilhavy,\n\nRates of cancer have exploded following the COVID-19 mass vaccination programs, with doctors and scientists all over the world now sounding the alarm.\n\nJust today a reader contacted us with the following tragic story:\n\nSubject: Cancer after Pfizer vaccine Hello, My husband prior to the vaccine was fit and healthy, strong, active. We both had the vaccination on 12.11.2021. about 10 hours kater we spitted first swollen node in his left armpit. Doctors ignored the symptom. Then second node, third\u2026 With 6 swollen nodes he was diagnosed with Mantle cell lymphoma. He\u2019s during very aggressive chemotherapy called Nordic regime. He\u2019s only 36 in May, so he was 35 when it all has started. MCL affects people after 60 usually. Before the vaccination our children brought from school many different viruses, from common flu, tummy bug, chicken pox, ear infections to covid. My husband was totally fine that time. His immune system worked brilliantly during September and October when me and our daughters suffered from mentioned diseases. He was working and taking care of us at that time. If he would have MCL then he wouldn\u2019t be able to fight all these viruses. Everything has changed within the hours from the first dose of Pfizer. At first my husband was ignored by GP as he claimed it was typical side effect which should disappear. When more nodes started swilling gp still claimed we should wait yet in January my husband was advised not to have second dose of the vaccination due to the side effects. In March I requested blood test to check whether it was cancer. Results returned completely fine. I immediately booked next blood test. Also returned completely fine. So without hesitation I booked appointment with go but this time I asked for different gp. During this appointment my husband was referred for ultrasound scan. From there to cancer clinic. 3 days later biopsy took place. Couple if days later we learnt the diagnosis mantle cell lymphoma. At this stage we were told it has nothing to do with the vaccination, yet for months we were expected to wait for side effects to disappear. Also, if the cancer is not in connection to vaccinate then how come my husband survived the 8 waves if different diseases starting from September ? In August we spent holidays in Scotland. Lots of walking and driving. My husband was in a very good shape. Let me say it again, prior to the vaccination my husband was strong, fit, active and healthy. Our life as a family has been literally ruined. We cannot go anywhere, we can\u2019t work, my husband us to weak, I have to care for him now and children. We are facing financial difficulties heading to a place where we won\u2019t be able to cover winter bills. MCL is incurable. Only treatable. If we are lucky, we may be back to temporary normality by March/April 2023. MCL comes back. Noone knows when. Second time it hits stronger\u2026 We can\u2019t take girls for holidays, we can\u2019t mix with other people as my husband\u2019s immune system is compromised. I am on standby all the time as I may need to take him to hospital in emergency like it happened already. Most of days we travel to hospital anyway. Sometimes even twice a day. I have never returned to myself after COVID and vaccination. Before I was very active and fit. Now Im not even at 50% of what I used to be. Our children will never be vaccinated!\n\nI did a search in the U.S. government Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) to see how many cases of the most common cancers had been reported following COVID-19 vaccines, and it returned a result of 837 cases of cancer, including 88 deaths, 66 permanent disabilities, and 104 life threatening events. (Source.)\n\nAnd this not an exhaustive list, as I tried to include ALL cancers listed in VAERS, but the database could not handle the query.\n\nI listed the cases by age, and of the 837 cases, 375 of them had no recorded age, although often the age can be found in the description.\n\nSo I put those 375 cases on the first page of the results, and starting on the second page you can see how young some of these cancer patients are following COVID-19 vaccines. (Source.)\n\nIt begins with a 12-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy, followed by many young adults in their 20s.\n\nUsing the exact same search terms for cancer, I then searched ALL FDA-approved vaccines for the previous 30 years and found only 140 cases of cancer reported. (Source.)\n\nThat result is for 360 months (30 years), whereas the 837 cases following the experimental COVID-19 vaccines were reported in just 20 months, since the roll out of the COVID-19 shots beginning in December of 2020.\n\nThat is an increase of 10,661.4%!\n\nA pathologist who lives in Sweden was just interviewed recently about the increasing rates of cancer she is seeing in her patients following the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nHer name is Dr. Ute Krueger, and the video is found on the Doctors For Covid Ethics Rumble Channel.\n\nThis is an amazing interview! Dr. Krueger is highly credentialed in her field, and yet few of her colleagues are willing to follow where the evidence leads, even though everyone is seeing a huge surge in cancer cases, and her reports to the Swedish Drug Administration have not been addressed. She states:\n\nI studied medicine because I wanted to help people. But now it feels like I am watching people being killed, and there\u2019s little I can do.\n\nThe Expos\u00e9 has also just published an excellent review of some of the scientific literature showing how the spike proteins are interfering with \u201cthe DNA repair mechanism in lymphocytes.\u201d\n\nThe COVID-19 mRNA \u201cVaccines\u201d cause Cancer; here\u2019s the evidence\u2026\n\nby Joel Smalley; Professional Data Analyst\n\nThe Expos\u00e9\n\nThe homologous recombination DNA repair pathway is one of the mechanisms that the body uses to stop your cells turning cancerous in response to environmental stress.\n\nOne of the most important components of this pathway is Tumor protein P53 (p53), the \u201cguardian of the genome\u201d. It protects our cells from cellular damage. Under cellular stress, p53 jumps into action, regulating gene expression to control DNA repair, cell division and cell death. It is the most commonly mutated gene in cancer.\n\nIn October 2021, two revered scientists, called Jiang and Mei, had a paper published, after peer review, in MDPI, showing that the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein obliterated the DNA repair mechanism in lymphocytes.\n\nEffect of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on homologous repair (HR) efficiency in lymphocytes\n\nThe viral spike protein was so toxic to this pathway that it knocked 90% of it out. If the whole spike protein got into the nucleus (in the ovaries), and enough of it was produced and hung around long enough before the body was able to get rid of it all, it would cause cancer. Fortunately, in the case of naturally infection, this is unlikely to occur.\n\nUnfortunately, the experimental mRNA toxshot induces spike protein to be produced (the full length spike exactly matching \u2013 amino acid for amino acid \u2013 the full length of the viral spike protein\u00b9) in and around the cell nucleus\u00b2 and is produced for at least 60 days and almost certainly longer\u00b3.\n\n\u201cFact checkers\u201d said the viral spike protein doesn\u2019t get in the nucleus despite the expert scientists showing that it absolutely does.\n\nConfocal microscopy study showing the spiker protein (green) proliferating the cell nucleus (blue)\n\nPublic health authorities and regulators said the vaccinal spike protein doesn\u2019t get in the nucleus despite the mRNA manufacturers submitting pictures of it doing so to them as part of their emergency use application.\n\nOK, so it gets into the nucleus but the official narrative says it doesn\u2019t stay in the body for more than a few hours. But, a huge study by one of the most respected molecular biology groups in the world at Stanford university\u2074 showed that the mRNA (producing the vaccinal spike antigen) was still present and active in the body after 60 days.\n\nJiang and Mei, quite logically and reasonably, cautioned that the mRNA spike protein would likely have the same effect as the viral spike protein on p53 and therefore cause cancer.\n\nTwo months after this revelation was highlighted by my friend, Jikky the Mouse, the Jiang and Mei paper was retracted due to spurious \u201cexpressions of concern\u201d (EOC) about the methods of the study despite them being standard practice.\n\nMoreover, the authors of the EOC were Eric Freed, the head of the US National Institute of Health (NIH) that funded Moderna, the patent holder of the COVID mRNA toxshot\u2075 and Oliver Shildgen, the actual editor of the journal that originally accepted the paper! And neither of them declared the conflicts of interest.\n\nWell, despite the retraction, the spike protein circulating in large quantities, in the direct vicinity of the cell nucleus, for elongated periods of time, still has the potential to induce cancer in those cells (ovary, pancreas, breast, prostate, lymph nodes). These cancers can take years to develop and so it\u2019s possible that we don\u2019t see much of a safety signal for 5 or 10 years.\n\nSources/References\n\nhttps://sciencebasedmedicine.org/spike-proteins-covid-19-and-vaccines/\n\nhttps://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/foi-2183-09.pdf\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35148837/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8786601/\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/moderna-covid-vaccine-patent-dispute-national-institutes-health/\n\nSource: The Expos\u00e9.\n\nYour Tax Free Donations Are Appreciated and Help Fund our Volunteer Website and Orphanage",
        "From theeopochtimes.com:\n\nThe Biden administration has granted a 90-day extension for the COVID-19 emergency, which was set to expire on July 15. This means that government spending, which has already driven the debt to near-record levels, will continue.\n\nAn extension of this state of emergency allows for the continued distribution of unapproved vaccines, under emergency use authorization. These drugs, which are still available for free, represent U.S. taxpayer money and government debt being used to pay private pharmaceutical companies billions of dollars. So far, 599 million doses have been administered in the U.S. at a cost of around $15 each, paid for by the government.\n\nThe extension means that in some states, low-income families may be entitled to enhanced food stamps and continued stimulus checks. Numerous federal and state-funded health programs will continue. California, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, and 10 other states are still sending out checks. Other programs extended through September include the Pandemic EBT (P-EBT), and a 15 percent increase in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. SNAP can now be used to make online purchases, so it is even easier to spend the free money. Additionally, there is $1 billion in nutrition assistance for American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Mariana Islands (CNMI), and Puerto Rico.\n\nIn late January 2020, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared a public health emergency (PHE). The following year, the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan was passed. It included a $10 billion Homeowner Assistance Fund, and $350 billion Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds. States are also able to access other monies to fight the pandemic.\n\nExtending the Pandemic Extends the Debt\n\nCOVID-19 spending has increased government borrowing in excess of the 2020 debt ceiling. The United States debt ceiling\u2014or debt limit\u2014is a limit on the amount of national debt that an administration can incur.\n\nIn December of 2021, Congress raised the U.S. debt ceiling by $2.5 trillion, to cover the government\u2019s operations until after the midterm elections in fall 2022. In order to pass the new debt ceiling, the rules had to be changed, which required a simple majority rather than 60 votes in the Senate, as had previously been the rule. Democrats voted for the debt ceiling increase. Republicans voted against it. And the measure was passed by a majority of 1 vote (with a 50 to 49 split).\n\nIn March of 2021, the federal deficit hit $660 billion, and as of June of 2022, the U.S. public debt stood at $30.57 trillion. By the end of the year, it is predicted to exceed 137 percent of gross domestic product. Extending the pandemic will only make it worse.\n\nOverspending Can Continue\n\nAlthough many expected pandemic-related government spending and state of emergency extensions to end, the COVID-19 disaster has had an open incident period (the period of time during which a federally declared disaster is occurring) and open period of performance (the deadline for completing emergency work) since it was issued in 2020.\n\nThis means that increased government spending can continue to drive up inflation.\n\nIn an attempt to cool off the economy, the Fed has raised interest rates, but the effects will be muted if the government continues to spend. Meanwhile, the cost of borrowing has increased, making excessive government spending even more expensive.\n\nAs prices continue to rise, it is becoming more difficult for low-earning Americans to support their basic needs. The Democratic response is to keep calling for a doubling of the federal minimum wage. Payroll accounts for between 15\u201330 percent of most business overhead. The average profit margin for small businesses is only 7\u201310 percent. Biden\u2019s plan for curbing inflation was to tell businesses to cut costs. Doubling the minimum wage would effectively wipe out the profits of most businesses. As a result, businesses would either shut down\u2014ballooning unemployment\u2014or they would have to increase their prices by as much as 30 percent to remain open and operate at the same profit level. If all businesses increase their prices by that much, Biden can achieve record hyperinflation.\n\nThe other solution Democrats have come up with is to increase government welfare programs. Measures such as additional transfer payments to the poor, including continued stimulus checks and increased food stamps all represent government spending that must be financed through borrowing. Increasing the national debt will not only cause inflation in the medium-term but will weaken the American economy in the long run.\n\nTo curb inflation, the United States needs to enact a contractionary fiscal policy. In other words, the government must put a moratorium on spending money it does not have. This means that the state of emergency related to the pandemic must be allowed to expire. The White House will also have to stop looking for other emergencies to declare. During the week of July 21, major media outlets reported their expectation that Biden would declare a climate emergency, although he has yet to do this. If he does, a brand-new cycle of spending can begin. As neither the pandemic nor the climate has specific, quantified endpoints, theoretically, the emergency could be continued forever.\n\nYour Tax Free Donations Are Appreciated and Help Fund our Volunteer Website and Orphanage",

        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nA doctor in Queensland, Australia has put his license to practice medicine on the line to bring his message of COVID-19 vaccine and injuries and deaths, and the \u201cgaslighting\u201d of patients and doctors who try to expose how deadly these shots are, to the public.\n\nHe received corporate media attention recently when he crashed a meeting of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) calling out the country\u2019s chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, while stunned doctors watched on.\n\nA Queensland GP who leads a prominent anti-vaccination protest group is facing suspension by Australia\u2019s peak medical board, following a live streamed tirade in front of the country\u2019s top doctor. Dr William Bay\u2019s antics were brought to the attention of the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) after he interrupted a conference hosted by the Australian Medical Association last month. The GP Registrar leads the Queensland People\u2019s Protest, an anti-vaccination protest group that promotes opposition to Covid-19 vaccine mandates. At last month\u2019s AMA conference, Dr Bay live streamed an astonishing spray against the country\u2019s chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, while stunned doctors watched on. \u201cI\u2019m here today to ask you to join with the people of Australia and stop forcing these vaccines on people who are getting killed by them,\u201d Dr Bay was heard shouting. Dr Bay accused Prof Kelly of lying and \u201cgaslighting\u201d his colleagues, before being escorted from the conference by security. \u201cAll GPs, all doctors of Australia you are on notice by the people of Queensland,\u201d he is heard shouting towards the end of the video. \u201cThis is the Queensland People\u2019s Protest and you have been warned.\u201d In a statement, an AHPRA spokeswoman said the Medical Board of Australia was proposing to suspend his registration by way of immediate action.

        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nA recording of a phone call between an irate father and a pharmacist who injected his 7-year-old son with a COVID-19 vaccine after his wife brought him to the pharmacy behind his back, and is now allegedly in the hospital due to myocarditis, has been circulating in the alternative media today.\n\nThe father and his family apparently live in New Zealand, while his work originates in New York, and what is remarkable about the call is that the father asks the pharmacist if parents are warned about the risks to myocarditis and heart disease before giving the COVID-19 shots to children, and the pharmacist replies:\n\nWe might scare the parents, and they don\u2019t want to get their child vaccinated.\n\nThis is on our Bitchute channel, and is also on our Odysee channel and Telegram channel as well.\n\nI found a couple of transcripts of the dialog, and this one (I found it on The Vigilant Fox) seems to be the most complete:\n\nFather: Are you a pharmacist?\n\nPharmacist: Yes, how can I help?\n\nFather: Yeah. Hey, I\u2019ve got a question. My wife, against my wishes, brought my seven-year-old son a few days ago for a COVID jab, and he\u2019s now in the hospital with myocarditis. And I was obviously not very happy with you guys or with my wife. She told me that she was not told that was a potential side effect. So why wouldn\u2019t you have told her that?\n\nPharmacist: Okay \u2014 sorry. So it\u2019s quite a rare side effect as well.\n\nFather: No, it\u2019s not. No, it\u2019s not because I\u2019ve been doing research; it\u2019s common. In the US, there\u2019s tens of thousands of them [myocarditis cases] reported to the CDC site. So why are you not telling parents this?\n\nPharmacist: We might scare the parents, and they don\u2019t want to get their child vaccinated.\n\nFather: So you don\u2019t want to scare the parents with something that is actually happening, that\u2019s happened to my kid? Are you out of your mind? Are you out of your mind? You don\u2019t want to scare them? You need to give them the right information so they can make a proper decision! What is wrong with you? You don\u2019t want to scare them. I\u2019m recording this conversation as well, and this is going to a lawyer next. Thank you for admitting that. So why don\u2019t you tell them? When someone comes in there and says, \u201cHey, what can go wrong?\u201d What do you say? \u201cSore arm\u201d? Have you seen the amount of dead people? Have you seen it?\n\nPharmacist: Has your wife asked before giving consent to give [the child the shot]?\n\nFather: She asked what the side effects are!\n\nPharmacist: She asked? I\u2019m not sure because I wasn\u2019t there.\n\nFather: It doesn\u2019t matter! You\u2019re supposed to tell people this can happen. So you know what the prognosis is? You know what it is? Possible death within five years. 20% of people with myocarditis die! It is a permanent, damaged heart. It is not temporary! He\u2019s facing a heart transplant because of you! Because you didn\u2019t want to scare her! You know no kids have died from COVID, not a single healthy kid, and you\u2019re giving this stuff out, and you\u2019re not warning people? What is wrong with you?\n\nPharmacist: So there are information online that you can look up \u2014\n\nFather: No! No! You gave the shot. When someone comes in there and asks what the side effects are, you don\u2019t NOT say because it might scare them from the shot. What is wrong with you?\n\nPharmacist: So the benefit of getting a vaccination is \u2014 solely giving a vaccination because the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nFather: No, it isn\u2019t! Do you know I\u2019m looking at a Johns Hopkins study? There have been 400 people under 18 die in the United States. 330 million people. Not one of them was healthy. They had cancer, leukemia, obesity, something wrong with them. Not one kid has died or ended up in the hospital. So the benefits are ZERO to my kid! Why did you not tell them? It\u2019s up to you to tell them. Then we make a decision. Not you! You tell us, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s rare, but it happens. You didn\u2019t tell her that, did you?\n\nPharmacist: I\u2019m not sure. I wasn\u2019t the vaccinator \u2014\n\nFather: You said you\u2019re not doing it. So when the next kid walks in there with a mother for a shot, are you going to tell them, \u201cHey, I just got a call from someone; their kid\u2019s heart is destroyed. Keep that in mind; that can happen.\u201d Are you going to tell them that? Are you?\n\nPharmacist: I cannot answer you that.\n\nFather: Well, why can\u2019t you because it\u2019s going to go in a court, and you\u2019ll answer it. You just admitted that you don\u2019t tell people because you don\u2019t want to scare them. It\u2019s recorded; I\u2019ve recorded everything.\n\nPharmacist: Sorry, I wasn\u2019t the pharmacist that did the vaccination.\n\nFather: It doesn\u2019t matter; you just said it! You just said that you don\u2019t tell people.\n\nPharmacist: I don\u2019t know what the situation is, so I don\u2019t know what she told in the vaccination error. I\u2019m not sure. I cannot speak on behalf of the pharmacist that vaccinated.\n\nFather: You just told me you don\u2019t tell people because you might scare them. I have it on a recording. You want me to play it back? Every call \u2014 because I\u2019m in finance \u2014 every call is recorded. Every email I sent is recorded. Every message I sent must be recorded because I work out of New York, and I live in New Zealand. It\u2019s all recorded because the SFC requires it. You are recorded. So you\u2019re telling people \u2014 you\u2019re not telling them they could get damaged, so in case you scare them from taking a shot that can kill them, right? Is that correct? Are you brain dead? What is wrong with you?\n\nPharmacist: Sorry, I don\u2019t think we should con \u2014 continue this conversation.\n\nFather: No, we should because are you going to tell people this is a risk when they come through there? My kid\u2019s screwed! You screwed him. What about everyone else? What are you going to do? You ruined a life! It\u2019s on you for the rest of your life. This kid is screwed because of you because your policy there is to not tell people that these vaccines are dangerous and deadly. Have you seen all the people dying in their sleep? Hundreds of them? Have you seen yesterday? An NFL first-round draft pick, 24 [years old] died? An NBA first-round draft pick died four days ago, dead after the shot. Are you seeing that? Are you sitting there in your bubble collecting your 50 bucks every shot you give, you murderer? So what are you going to do? Are you going to tell parents? Are you going to say, \u201cLook, this is what can happen; it\u2019s not a sore shoulder\u201d? That\u2019s usual, but they can ruin their lives. How do you feel about that you\u2019re ruining lives? Are you going to tell them or not? Are you going to continue to do this?\n\nPharmacist: Um \u2014 that\u2019s not the decision that I make.\n\nFather: It isn\u2019t? So you\u2019re just going to tell people, \u201cOh, nothing can go wrong,\u201d and more kids are going to end up in the hospital with ruined hearts, right? That\u2019s the plan? Because you can\u2019t make that decision. And you\u2019d hate for them not to take the shot, eh? Because then you don\u2019t get your 50 bucks, do you?\n\nPharmacist: So we always ask consent for the parent before we do the vaccinations.\n\nFather: Yeah, but you don\u2019t tell them what can go wrong! Of course, you asked consent. The parent came there with that kid. It\u2019s obvious consent. Why are you not telling them what can go wrong? I\u2019m sure they\u2019re asking. But you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, no. Nothing goes wrong. Just a sore shoulder.\u201d Right? You don\u2019t tell them that the crazy guy called you and said his kid\u2019s life is ruined because of what you did a few days ago. Do you or will you? You are sick! You are sick! You are twisted. You are evil. You\u2019re a monster. You\u2019re wrecking lives. You\u2019re killing babies. You\u2019re killing children. You\u2019re killing mothers. You\u2019re disgusting. Totally disgusting. Do you not see that? You need to at least tell them \u201cThis can go wrong,\u201d because when you don\u2019t, this happens! Don\u2019t you see that?\n\nThe next part is very expletive. I do not agree with the name-calling here, but I do understand the frustration from the parent.\n\nFather: Are you so f*cking stupid? You f*cking murdering bitch! F*ck! And you\u2019re going to continue to do it! \u201cOh, I don\u2019t make that.\u201d You f*cking moron. You are f*cking sick in the brain.

        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nRates of cancer have exploded following the COVID-19 mass vaccination programs, with doctors and scientists all over the world now sounding the alarm.\n\nJust today a reader contacted us with the following tragic story:\n\nSubject: Cancer after Pfizer vaccine Hello, My husband prior to the vaccine was fit and healthy, strong, active. We both had the vaccination on 12.11.2021. about 10 hours kater we spitted first swollen node in his left armpit. Doctors ignored the symptom. Then second node, third\u2026 With 6 swollen nodes he was diagnosed with Mantle cell lymphoma. He\u2019s during very aggressive chemotherapy called Nordic regime. He\u2019s only 36 in May, so he was 35 when it all has started. MCL affects people after 60 usually. Before the vaccination our children brought from school many different viruses, from common flu, tummy bug, chicken pox, ear infections to covid. My husband was totally fine that time. His immune system worked brilliantly during September and October when me and our daughters suffered from mentioned diseases. He was working and taking care of us at that time. If he would have MCL then he wouldn\u2019t be able to fight all these viruses. Everything has changed within the hours from the first dose of Pfizer. At first my husband was ignored by GP as he claimed it was typical side effect which should disappear. When more nodes started swilling gp still claimed we should wait yet in January my husband was advised not to have second dose of the vaccination due to the side effects. In March I requested blood test to check whether it was cancer. Results returned completely fine. I immediately booked next blood test. Also returned completely fine. So without hesitation I booked appointment with go but this time I asked for different gp. During this appointment my husband was referred for ultrasound scan. From there to cancer clinic. 3 days later biopsy took place. Couple if days later we learnt the diagnosis mantle cell lymphoma. At this stage we were told it has nothing to do with the vaccination, yet for months we were expected to wait for side effects to disappear. Also, if the cancer is not in connection to vaccinate then how come my husband survived the 8 waves if different diseases starting from September ? In August we spent holidays in Scotland. Lots of walking and driving. My husband was in a very good shape. Let me say it again, prior to the vaccination my husband was strong, fit, active and healthy. Our life as a family has been literally ruined. We cannot go anywhere, we can\u2019t work, my husband us to weak, I have to care for him now and children. We are facing financial difficulties heading to a place where we won\u2019t be able to cover winter bills. MCL is incurable. Only treatable. If we are lucky, we may be back to temporary normality by March/April 2023. MCL comes back. Noone knows when. Second time it hits stronger\u2026 We can\u2019t take girls for holidays, we can\u2019t mix with other people as my husband\u2019s immune system is compromised. I am on standby all the time as I may need to take him to hospital in emergency like it happened already. Most of days we travel to hospital anyway. Sometimes even twice a day. I have never returned to myself after COVID and vaccination. Before I was very active and fit. Now Im not even at 50% of what I used to be. Our children will never be vaccinated!\n\nI did a search in the U.S. government Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) to see how many cases of the most common cancers had been reported following COVID-19 vaccines, and it returned a result of 837 cases of cancer, including 88 deaths, 66 permanent disabilities, and 104 life threatening events. (Source.)\n\nAnd this not an exhaustive list, as I tried to include ALL cancers listed in VAERS, but the database could not handle the query.\n\nI listed the cases by age, and of the 837 cases, 375 of them had no recorded age, although often the age can be found in the description.\n\nSo I put those 375 cases on the first page of the results, and starting on the second page you can see how young some of these cancer patients are following COVID-19 vaccines. (Source.)\n\nIt begins with a 12-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy, followed by many young adults in their 20s.\n\nUsing the exact same search terms for cancer, I then searched ALL FDA-approved vaccines for the previous 30 years and found only 140 cases of cancer reported. (Source.)\n\nThat result is for 360 months (30 years), whereas the 837 cases following the experimental COVID-19 vaccines were reported in just 20 months, since the roll out of the COVID-19 shots beginning in December of 2020.\n\nThat is an increase of 10,661.4%!\n\nA pathologist who lives in Sweden was just interviewed recently about the increasing rates of cancer she is seeing in her patients following the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nHer name is Dr. Ute Krueger, and the video is found on the Doctors For Covid Ethics Rumble Channel.\n\nThis is an amazing interview! Dr. Krueger is highly credentialed in her field, and yet few of her colleagues are willing to follow where the evidence leads, even though everyone is seeing a huge surge in cancer cases, and her reports to the Swedish Drug Administration have not been addressed. She states:\n\nI studied medicine because I wanted to help people. But now it feels like I am watching people being killed, and there\u2019s little I can do.\n\nThe Expos\u00e9 has also just published an excellent review of some of the scientific literature showing how the spike proteins are interfering with \u201cthe DNA repair mechanism in lymphocytes.\u201d\n\nThe COVID-19 mRNA \u201cVaccines\u201d cause Cancer; here\u2019s the evidence\u2026\n\nby Joel Smalley; Professional Data Analyst\n\nThe Expos\u00e9\n\nThe homologous recombination DNA repair pathway is one of the mechanisms that the body uses to stop your cells turning cancerous in response to environmental stress.\n\nOne of the most important components of this pathway is Tumor protein P53 (p53), the \u201cguardian of the genome\u201d. It protects our cells from cellular damage. Under cellular stress, p53 jumps into action, regulating gene expression to control DNA repair, cell division and cell death. It is the most commonly mutated gene in cancer.\n\nIn October 2021, two revered scientists, called Jiang and Mei, had a paper published, after peer review, in MDPI, showing that the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein obliterated the DNA repair mechanism in lymphocytes.\n\nEffect of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on homologous repair (HR) efficiency in lymphocytes\n\nThe viral spike protein was so toxic to this pathway that it knocked 90% of it out. If the whole spike protein got into the nucleus (in the ovaries), and enough of it was produced and hung around long enough before the body was able to get rid of it all, it would cause cancer. Fortunately, in the case of naturally infection, this is unlikely to occur.\n\nUnfortunately, the experimental mRNA toxshot induces spike protein to be produced (the full length spike exactly matching \u2013 amino acid for amino acid \u2013 the full length of the viral spike protein\u00b9) in and around the cell nucleus\u00b2 and is produced for at least 60 days and almost certainly longer\u00b3.\n\n\u201cFact checkers\u201d said the viral spike protein doesn\u2019t get in the nucleus despite the expert scientists showing that it absolutely does.\n\nConfocal microscopy study showing the spiker protein (green) proliferating the cell nucleus (blue)\n\nPublic health authorities and regulators said the vaccinal spike protein doesn\u2019t get in the nucleus despite the mRNA manufacturers submitting pictures of it doing so to them as part of their emergency use application.\n\nOK, so it gets into the nucleus but the official narrative says it doesn\u2019t stay in the body for more than a few hours. But, a huge study by one of the most respected molecular biology groups in the world at Stanford university\u2074 showed that the mRNA (producing the vaccinal spike antigen) was still present and active in the body after 60 days.\n\nJiang and Mei, quite logically and reasonably, cautioned that the mRNA spike protein would likely have the same effect as the viral spike protein on p53 and therefore cause cancer.\n\nTwo months after this revelation was highlighted by my friend, Jikky the Mouse, the Jiang and Mei paper was retracted due to spurious \u201cexpressions of concern\u201d (EOC) about the methods of the study despite them being standard practice.\n\nMoreover, the authors of the EOC were Eric Freed, the head of the US National Institute of Health (NIH) that funded Moderna, the patent holder of the COVID mRNA toxshot\u2075 and Oliver Shildgen, the actual editor of the journal that originally accepted the paper! And neither of them declared the conflicts of interest.\n\nWell, despite the retraction, the spike protein circulating in large quantities, in the direct vicinity of the cell nucleus, for elongated periods of time, still has the potential to induce cancer in those cells (ovary, pancreas, breast, prostate, lymph nodes). These cancers can take years to develop and so it\u2019s possible that we don\u2019t see much of a safety signal for 5 or 10 years.\n\nSources/References\n\nhttps://sciencebasedmedicine.org/spike-proteins-covid-19-and-vaccines/\n\nhttps://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/foi-2183-09.pdf\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35148837/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8786601/\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/moderna-covid-vaccine-patent-dispute-national-institutes-health/\n\nRead the full article at The Expos\u00e9.\n\nComment on this article at HealthImpactNews.com.\n\nSee Also:\n\nCOVID-19 \u201cVaccine\u201d Casualties List\n\nSee Also:\n\nUnderstand the Times We are Currently Living Through\n\nSupport the case against Medical Kidnapping by purchasing our new book!\n\nIf you know people who are skeptical and cannot believe that medical kidnapping happens in the U.S. today, this is the book for them!

(Source.)\n\nA 2011 report by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Inc. for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) stated that less than 1% of all adverse events following vaccines are ever reported to VAERS.\n\nAlthough 25% of ambulatory patients experience an adverse drug event, less than 0.3% of all adverse drug events and 1-13% of serious events are reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Likewise, fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported. Low reporting rates preclude or slow the identification of \u201cproblem\u201d drugs and vaccines that endanger public health. New surveillance methods for drug and vaccine adverse effects are needed. (Source.)\n\nThere have now been more deaths and vaccine side effects reported during the past 20 months to VAERS following COVID-19 vaccines than there have been for the entire previous 30 years for all FDA-approved vaccines before the Emergency Use Authorization of the COVID-19 shots in December of 2020. (834,124 cases, 9,278 deaths \u2013 source.)\n\n46,999 Deaths and 4,731,833 Injuries in EudraVigilance\n\nThe European (EEA and non-EEA countries) database of suspected drug reaction reports is EudraVigilance, verified by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and they are now reporting 46,999 fatalities, and 4,731,833 injuries following injections of five experimental COVID-19 shots:\n\nFrom the total of injuries recorded, almost half of them (2,143,362) are serious injuries.\n\n\u201cSeriousness provides information on the suspected undesirable effect; it can be classified as \u2018serious\u2019 if it corresponds to a medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalisation, results in another medically important condition, or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.\u201d\n\nA Health Impact News subscriber in Europe ran the reports for each of the four COVID-19 shots we are including here. It is a lot of work to tabulate each reaction with injuries and fatalities, since there is no place on the EudraVigilance system we have found that tabulates all the results.\n\nSince we have started

The U.S. FDA reached a similar decision back in June, according to the news service. So far, just 250,000 doses of the shot have been administered in Europe. (Source.)\n\nHere are some faces to place on these cold, deadly statistics to show how people\u2019s lives are being destroyed by the vaccines, while the pharma-funded corporate media continues to hide their vaccination status, and one has to find it usually on the person\u2019s social media accounts where they usually brag about getting a COVID-19 shot while ridiculing those who refuse them.\n\nThey\u2019re dead now, while those who refused the shots cannot die by being injected by them. They just have to endure the ridicule and scorn from the pro-vaccine crowd, which is quickly dwindling.\n\nby WXXV25\n\nA Brandon High School football player died Monday during an afternoon football practice.\n\nPhillip Laster Jr. passed away on Monday.

        "by The Expos\u00e9\n\nThe UK Medicine Regulator has confirmed that over a period of nineteen months the Covid-19 Vaccines have caused at least 5.5x as many deaths as all other available vaccines combined in the past 21 years.\n\nThis means, that when compared side by side, the Covid-19 injections are a shocking 7,402% more deadly than every other vaccine available in the UK.\n\nA Freedom of Information request was made via email to the Medicine and Healthcare product Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on the 6th August 2021 in which a Mr Anderson asked the MHRA the following questions \u2013\n\nHow many Deaths have there been from all Covid-19 vaccines?\n\nAre there any other reporting AI system monitoring systems like the Yellow Card scheme?\n\nAre Covid-19 Vaccines still in trials?\n\nHow many deaths has there been in last 20 years by previous Vaccines without Covid-19 Vaccines?\n\nWhat happens if a there is a new vaccine or new drug? What process and monitoring do they go through?\n\nWhat cut off point will the MHRA say a vaccine or drug is unsafe for humans?\n\nThe MHRA responded with the usual \u201cwe do not hold this information\u201d, as seen time and time again from Government departments.\n\nHowever, they did confirm that they are using other epidemiological studies, anonymised GP-based electronic healthcare records and international experience to proactively monitor safety alongside the spontaneous reports received via the Yellow Card scheme.\n\nThe MHRA also confirmed that the current Covid-19 vaccines on offer in the United Kingdom are only under a temporary authorisation and that these authorisations do not constitute a marketing authorisation.\n\nIn answer to the question asked on the number of deaths due to all other vaccines in the past twenty years the MHRA provided the usual robotic response about how great the Covid-19 vaccines are and how they are the \u201csingle most effective treatment for preventing serious illness due to Covid-19\u201d but what they did not do is say that they \u201cdo not hold this information\u201d.\n\nInstead, they revealed that they had received a total of 404 reported adverse reactions to all available vaccines (excluding the Covid-19 injections) associated with a fatal outcome between the 1st January 2001 and the 25th August 2021 \u2013 a time frame of 20 years and 8 months.\n\nBut how does that fare against the number of reported adverse reactions to all temporarily authorised Covid-19 vaccines associated with a fatal outcome?\n\nWell, since the Pfizer injection was rolled out in December 2020 there have been 808 reported deaths as of 13th July 22, meaning that in just 19 months, this \u201cvaccine\u201d alone outnumbers the deaths due to all other vaccines combined in the past 20 years.\n\nHowever, the AstraZeneca viral vector injection has fared much worse with 1,294 deaths being reported to the MHRA since January 2020, more than three times as many deaths as what has been reported due to all other vaccines in the past 20 years.\n\nThere have also been 62 reported deaths due to the Moderna jab since it was first administered in June 2021, and 49 deaths where the brand of Covid-19 vaccine was not specified in the report.\n\nTherefore, up to July 13th 2022, there have been a grand total of 2,213 deaths reported to the MHRA as adverse reactions to all available Covid-19 vaccines in the United Kingdom since the beginning of 2021.\n\nMeaning there have officially been 5.5x as many deaths in just 19 months due to the Covid-19 vaccines than there have been due to every other available vaccine combined since the year 2001.\n\nTwenty years and 8 months is a period that is 13.7 x longer than the nineteen-month period where the Covid-19 vaccines have been rolled out.\n\nTherefore, the number of deaths reported to all other vaccines combined in the same time frame of nineteen months equates to 29.5 deaths.\n\nThis means the Covid-19 injections are proving to be a shocking 7,402% more deadly than every other vaccine available in the UK.",
        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nA recording of a phone call between an irate father and a pharmacist who injected his 7-year-old son with a COVID-19 vaccine after his wife brought him to the pharmacy behind his back, and is now allegedly in the hospital due to myocarditis, has been circulating in the alternative media today.\n\nThe father and his family apparently live in New Zealand, while his work originates in New York, and what is remarkable about the call is that the father asks the pharmacist if parents are warned about the risks to myocarditis and heart disease before giving the COVID-19 shots to children, and the pharmacist replies:\n\nWe might scare the parents, and they don\u2019t want to get their child vaccinated.\n\nThis is on our Bitchute channel, and is also on our Odysee channel and Telegram channel as well.\n\nI found a couple of transcripts of the dialog, and this one (I found it on The Vigilant Fox) seems to be the most complete:\n\nFather: Are you a pharmacist?\n\nPharmacist: Yes, how can I help?\n\nFather: Yeah. Hey, I\u2019ve got a question. My wife, against my wishes, brought my seven-year-old son a few days ago for a COVID jab, and he\u2019s now in the hospital with myocarditis. And I was obviously not very happy with you guys or with my wife. She told me that she was not told that was a potential side effect. So why wouldn\u2019t you have told her that?\n\nPharmacist: Okay \u2014 sorry. So it\u2019s quite a rare side effect as well.\n\nFather: No, it\u2019s not. No, it\u2019s not because I\u2019ve been doing research; it\u2019s common. In the US, there\u2019s tens of thousands of them [myocarditis cases] reported to the CDC site. So why are you not telling parents this?\n\nPharmacist: We might scare the parents, and they don\u2019t want to get their child vaccinated.\n\nFather: So you don\u2019t want to scare the parents with something that is actually happening, that\u2019s happened to my kid? Are you out of your mind? Are you out of your mind? You don\u2019t want to scare them? You need to give them the right information so they can make a proper decision! What is wrong with you? You don\u2019t want to scare them. I\u2019m recording this conversation as well, and this is going to a lawyer next. Thank you for admitting that. So why don\u2019t you tell them? When someone comes in there and says, \u201cHey, what can go wrong?\u201d What do you say? \u201cSore arm\u201d? Have you seen the amount of dead people? Have you seen it?\n\nPharmacist: Has your wife asked before giving consent to give [the child the shot]?\n\nFather: She asked what the side effects are!\n\nPharmacist: She asked? I\u2019m not sure because I wasn\u2019t there.\n\nFather: It doesn\u2019t matter! You\u2019re supposed to tell people this can happen. So you know what the prognosis is? You know what it is? Possible death within five years. 20% of people with myocarditis die! It is a permanent, damaged heart. It is not temporary! He\u2019s facing a heart transplant because of you! Because you didn\u2019t want to scare her! You know no kids have died from COVID, not a single healthy kid, and you\u2019re giving this stuff out, and you\u2019re not warning people? What is wrong with you?\n\nPharmacist: So there are information online that you can look up \u2014\n\nFather: No! No! You gave the shot. When someone comes in there and asks what the side effects are, you don\u2019t NOT say because it might scare them from the shot. What is wrong with you?\n\nPharmacist: So the benefit of getting a vaccination is \u2014 solely giving a vaccination because the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nFather: No, it isn\u2019t! Do you know I\u2019m looking at a Johns Hopkins study? There have been 400 people under 18 die in the United States. 330 million people. Not one of them was healthy. They had cancer, leukemia, obesity, something wrong with them. Not one kid has died or ended up in the hospital. So the benefits are ZERO to my kid! Why did you not tell them? It\u2019s up to you to tell them. Then we make a decision. Not you! You tell us, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s rare, but it happens. You didn\u2019t tell her that, did you?\n\nPharmacist: I\u2019m not sure. I wasn\u2019t the vaccinator \u2014\n\nFather: You said you\u2019re not doing it. So when the next kid walks in there with a mother for a shot, are you going to tell them, \u201cHey, I just got a call from someone; their kid\u2019s heart is destroyed. Keep that in mind; that can happen.\u201d Are you going to tell them that? Are you?\n\nPharmacist: I cannot answer you that.\n\nFather: Well, why can\u2019t you because it\u2019s going to go in a court, and you\u2019ll answer it. You just admitted that you don\u2019t tell people because you don\u2019t want to scare them. It\u2019s recorded; I\u2019ve recorded everything.\n\nPharmacist: Sorry, I wasn\u2019t the pharmacist that did the vaccination.\n\nFather: It doesn\u2019t matter; you just said it! You just said that you don\u2019t tell people.\n\nPharmacist: I don\u2019t know what the situation is, so I don\u2019t know what she told in the vaccination error. I\u2019m not sure. I cannot speak on behalf of the pharmacist that vaccinated.\n\nFather: You just told me you don\u2019t tell people because you might scare them. I have it on a recording. You want me to play it back? Every call \u2014 because I\u2019m in finance \u2014 every call is recorded. Every email I sent is recorded. Every message I sent must be recorded because I work out of New York, and I live in New Zealand. It\u2019s all recorded because the SFC requires it. You are recorded. So you\u2019re telling people \u2014 you\u2019re not telling them they could get damaged, so in case you scare them from taking a shot that can kill them, right? Is that correct? Are you brain dead? What is wrong with you?\n\nPharmacist: Sorry, I don\u2019t think we should con \u2014 continue this conversation.\n\nFather: No, we should because are you going to tell people this is a risk when they come through there? My kid\u2019s screwed! You screwed him. What about everyone else? What are you going to do? You ruined a life! It\u2019s on you for the rest of your life. This kid is screwed because of you because your policy there is to not tell people that these vaccines are dangerous and deadly. Have you seen all the people dying in their sleep? Hundreds of them? Have you seen yesterday? An NFL first-round draft pick, 24 [years old] died? An NBA first-round draft pick died four days ago, dead after the shot. Are you seeing that? Are you sitting there in your bubble collecting your 50 bucks every shot you give, you murderer? So what are you going to do? Are you going to tell parents? Are you going to say, \u201cLook, this is what can happen; it\u2019s not a sore shoulder\u201d? That\u2019s usual, but they can ruin their lives. How do you feel about that you\u2019re ruining lives? Are you going to tell them or not? Are you going to continue to do this?\n\nPharmacist: Um \u2014 that\u2019s not the decision that I make.\n\nFather: It isn\u2019t? So you\u2019re just going to tell people, \u201cOh, nothing can go wrong,\u201d and more kids are going to end up in the hospital with ruined hearts, right? That\u2019s the plan? Because you can\u2019t make that decision. And you\u2019d hate for them not to take the shot, eh? Because then you don\u2019t get your 50 bucks, do you?\n\nPharmacist: So we always ask consent for the parent before we do the vaccinations.\n\nFather: Yeah, but you don\u2019t tell them what can go wrong! Of course, you asked consent. The parent came there with that kid. It\u2019s obvious consent. Why are you not telling them what can go wrong? I\u2019m sure they\u2019re asking. But you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, no. Nothing goes wrong. Just a sore shoulder.\u201d Right? You don\u2019t tell them that the crazy guy called you and said his kid\u2019s life is ruined because of what you did a few days ago. Do you or will you? You are sick! You are sick! You are twisted. You are evil. You\u2019re a monster. You\u2019re wrecking lives. You\u2019re killing babies. You\u2019re killing children. You\u2019re killing mothers. You\u2019re disgusting. Totally disgusting. Do you not see that? You need to at least tell them \u201cThis can go wrong,\u201d because when you don\u2019t, this happens! Don\u2019t you see that?\n\nThe next part is very expletive. I do not agree with the name-calling here, but I do understand the frustration from the parent.\n\nFather: Are you so f*cking stupid? You f*cking murdering bitch! F*ck! And you\u2019re going to continue to do it! \u201cOh, I don\u2019t make that.\u201d You f*cking moron. You are f*cking sick in the brain.

        "by The Expos\u00e9\n\nThe UK Medicine Regulator has confirmed that over a period of nineteen months the Covid-19 Vaccines have caused at least 5.5x as many deaths as all other available vaccines combined in the past 21 years.\n\nThis means, that when compared side by side, the Covid-19 injections are a shocking 7,402% more deadly than every other vaccine available in the UK.\n\nA Freedom of Information request was made via email to the Medicine and Healthcare product Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on the 6th August 2021 in which a Mr Anderson asked the MHRA the following questions \u2013\n\nHow many Deaths have there been from all Covid-19 vaccines?\n\nAre there any other reporting AI system monitoring systems like the Yellow Card scheme?\n\nAre Covid-19 Vaccines still in trials?\n\nHow many deaths has there been in last 20 years by previous Vaccines without Covid-19 Vaccines?\n\nWhat happens if a there is a new vaccine or new drug? What process and monitoring do they go through?\n\nWhat cut off point will the MHRA say a vaccine or drug is unsafe for humans?\n\nThe MHRA responded with the usual \u201cwe do not hold this information\u201d, as seen time and time again from Government departments.\n\nHowever, they did confirm that they are using other epidemiological studies, anonymised GP-based electronic healthcare records and international experience to proactively monitor safety alongside the spontaneous reports received via the Yellow Card scheme.\n\nThe MHRA also confirmed that the current Covid-19 vaccines on offer in the United Kingdom are only under a temporary authorisation and that these authorisations do not constitute a marketing authorisation.\n\nIn answer to the question asked on the number of deaths due to all other vaccines in the past twenty years the MHRA provided the usual robotic response about how great the Covid-19 vaccines are and how they are the \u201csingle most effective treatment for preventing serious illness due to Covid-19\u201d but what they did not do is say that they \u201cdo not hold this information\u201d.\n\nInstead, they revealed that they had received a total of 404 reported adverse reactions to all available vaccines (excluding the Covid-19 injections) associated with a fatal outcome between the 1st January 2001 and the 25th August 2021 \u2013 a time frame of 20 years and 8 months.\n\nBut how does that fare against the number of reported adverse reactions to all temporarily authorised Covid-19 vaccines associated with a fatal outcome?\n\nWell, since the Pfizer injection was rolled out in December 2020 there have been 808 reported deaths as of 13th July 22, meaning that in just 19 months, this \u201cvaccine\u201d alone outnumbers the deaths due to all other vaccines combined in the past 20 years.\n\nHowever, the AstraZeneca viral vector injection has fared much worse with 1,294 deaths being reported to the MHRA since January 2020, more than three times as many deaths as what has been reported due to all other vaccines in the past 20 years.\n\nThere have also been 62 reported deaths due to the Moderna jab since it was first administered in June 2021, and 49 deaths where the brand of Covid-19 vaccine was not specified in the report.\n\nTherefore, up to July 13th 2022, there have been a grand total of 2,213 deaths reported to the MHRA as adverse reactions to all available Covid-19 vaccines in the United Kingdom since the beginning of 2021.\n\nMeaning there have officially been 5.5x as many deaths in just 19 months due to the Covid-19 vaccines than there have been due to every other available vaccine combined since the year 2001.\n\nTwenty years and 8 months is a period that is 13.7 x longer than the nineteen-month period where the Covid-19 vaccines have been rolled out.\n\nTherefore, the number of deaths reported to all other vaccines combined in the same time frame of nineteen months equates to 29.5 deaths.\n\nThis means the Covid-19 injections are proving to be a shocking 7,402% more deadly than every other vaccine available in the UK.",

There was never any preponderance of evidence that a cloth mask did anything. It was a lie. I won't even address that he's also lying about \"aquisition\" in this statement, they don't \"know\" anything.Like the rest of the crumbling narrative it's becoming clear they sold you lies packaged as science and are now claiming things like their policies were based on \"hope\" or, like Fauci here, act confused that various government agencies pushed policy based on his own statements. They never spoke out about mask mandates. They actively tried to suppress any challenge to their lies. This is fraud, it's weaponization of government against citizens, and it needs to be addressed.Fauci is surprised the messages were mixed and response was poor, but he was the one in charge of the messaging. His desire for fame and adulation forced him to violate the rules of public health messaging and he ran in front of every camera he could find to spew his verbal diarrhea over the airwaves.Dr Birx has admitted that she didn't believe vaccines were effective and admits to manipulating the public. This removes the ability for test subjects in the COVID immune system therapeutic trials, still ongoing, to enter under the rules of informed consent. You were all lied to, knowingly, by the people you defended at the cost of your own reputations.She knew this and has pushed for vaccination anyway. The CDC still is pushing this on children who, prior to the immune system therapy being introduced, had almost no risk of getting seriously ill or dying from COVID. These are facts.For those esteemed COVID and science experts, let me explain. Healthy children did not get seriously ill or die from COVID in any significant numbers. Birx has claimed she wanted to ignore efficacy disclosures because the vaccine still prevented hospitalization and death. Children were at almost no risk of this. She manipulated the public into believing that vaccinating their children was effective and, more egregiously, that it had any benefit to their children that exceeded the risk.She needs to be tried and she deserves to spend the remainder of her life in prison.They have admitted to promoting a vaccine they knew is not effective against transmission to a demographic that they admit, through their own public statements, provides almost no benefit while also introducing unknown risk. This is criminal. It violates medical ethics. They have done real harm to children who experience a diminished ability to fight infection as the spike producing therapy loses efficacy, before we account for adverse effect at all. It's an egregious violation of the public trust.There is no longer any excuse for you to be defending these people, not that you'll stop because you are driven by politics. You have never listened to science nor actual experts. You have listened to myths. You are faithful followers of the church of science as preached by globalist interests and greedy corporations.You can post your lamentations here. You can post your apologies here. You can post your rage at me for telling you this for two years here.And as I know you'll do, you can post your deflections and excuses here too. You may want to review your post history and signature blocks before you do. You may have forgotten what was said. ATS doesn't.No amount of explaining can explain around that they lied knowingly about an alleged public health emergency and by doing so it resulted in children taking an unnecessary vaccine that is currently cited to have a risk of 1 in 5,000 of causing a potentially fatal cardiac condition. IN CHILDREN. This is only one of several dozen known adverse effects of the ineffective immune system therapeutic which, to this day, is still only available as manufactured under an emergency use agreement. Now they need to investigate the fraud that enabled an emergency use approval for this ineffective and potentially dangerous toxin across the entire population. Yes, an injection that does not provide a medical benefit and has deleterious effects is defined as a toxin. They have injected a toxin into children intentionally. The have now admitted it.If you are a rat, it might be time to start abandoning ship. History is not going to be kind.You were warned. We walked you through the science tirelessly. We showed you evidence. We pointed out the inconsistencies and the hypocrisy. We told you the financial repercussions. We all collectively cried foul when the children became targets. We endured the ill will and the persecution because we actually care about children we'll never meet. Now, because you refused to listen to anybody except your political operatives, many children will never live to be adults. We tried to help the people that wanted us censored. We did it for two years and you spit in our faces. Millions of people are suffering, many millions more will.It's time for change. You can be a participant in bringing about this change or you can be a target of those that are. Science is going to win.",

        "\n\n\n\nProfessor Shmuel Shapira, M.D., MPH, served as the Director General of the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) between 2013 and 2021, where he led Israel\u2019s effort to develop a coronavirus vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn February 6, 2022, Shapira asked: \"What grade would you give to a vaccine that people are vaccinated with three times and get sick twice (as of today)? Not to mention significant side effects[.]\"\n\n\n\nOn April 9, 2022, Shapira said: \"The CEO of the company, millions of whose vaccines were used in Israel for vaccination, stated in an interview with NBC that Israel serves as the world's laboratory. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first case in history where experimental guinea pigs paid an exorbitant rate for their participation.\"\n\n\n\nOn May 13, 2022, Shapira said: \"I received 3 vaccinations, I was physically injured in a very significant way as many others were injured[.] And in addition, my trust in the nature of the decisions and in the processes of making them has been severely eroded. No one asked and checked. I will fight with all my might so that truthful answers regarding all decisions and not just regarding the vaccine are given[.]\"\n\n\n\nOn July 18, 2022, Shapira said: \u201cI am not anti-vaccine, I am anti-stupidity, anti-fake science, and anti-incompetent management.\u201d\n\n\n\nedit on 3-8-2022 by v1rtu0s0 because: (no reason given)\n\n\n\nWho is he?Dr. Shapira is very high up when it comes to Israeli medicine and biology, as well as the Covid vaccine itself. He was personally injured from the third Pfizer shot and does not try to hide that fact. Although he has been sufficiently censored, the doctor has been openly critical of the Covid shots. Notable quotes from Dr. Sharpira in 2022:One of the newest arguments to attempt to cover up the vaccine injuries in VAERS is to say that every time there is a new vaccine, there is a spike in reports. WHERE ARE THE OTHER SPIKES AT??It's actually laughable to suggest the director of biological research in charge of vaccine research who is giving his opinion on the vaccine is an \"anti-vaxxer\" because he doesn't think it works and was physically injured by it. So when a qualified doctor gives his opinion on twitter, he's censored because it doesn't go along with the narrative, even doctors of this statue and caliber. This was the person who led vaccine research in Israel of all countries, who were at the forefront of \"vaccinating\" their population and is now paying dearly for it.",

I stay away from that and continue to Hanover\u2019s Kr\u00f6pcke central square, where on this mild January evening several hundred people can be found, most of them on their way to or from the shops.\n\nKeeping an eye out for possible walkers, I stop for a moment and a lady standing next to me abruptly says she hasn\u2019t been downtown for ages because of lockdowns and masks. As I feel the same way, we admire the Christmas decorations together for half a minute. As I want to move on, there are suddenly five police officers in front of us and, as I turn around, about ten to fifteen behind us, forming a ring around the lady, myself and maybe eight other, mostly older people. Asked what this means, a blonde policewoman answers me that she hereby declares us an [illegal] assembly. I immediately put on my FFP2 mask, am honestly shocked and reply that this is probably a civic prank. As a result of the police presence and the crowd that has formed, there are now many spectators in the square, and basically any group of people could be surrounded from behind and declared an \u201cassembly\u201d.\n\nAn acquaintance who happens to be passing by wants to join me, but she is not allowed into police-surrounded group, and I am not allowed out. More and more police officers arrive, also spectators, and the whole scene is getting filmed many times over. I also receive shouts from people who recognize me and express their surprise at this strange measure. The term \u201cfascism\u201d gets used, and the police officers are verbally attacked harshly by the bystanders.\n\nAfter about a quarter of an hour, things get serious: I am taken away by three men, and when I ask what I am accused of, I get the answer: violation of the obligation to wear a mask. I reply that I am wearing one, even FFP2, and have been since the group formed. But it is of no use: I should have been wearing the mask before the group formed, and that they have photos to prove that this was not the case.\n\nNow that I am away from the others, I only notice out of the corner of my eye that the others who are not wearing masks are far worse off. Maybe because they just wanted to walk through the city and for that reason didn\u2019t have one with them. In any case, I hear commotion and screams, but as a detained person I cannot investigate. After taking my personal details, the police tell me that proceedings will be taken against me and that I am banished from the entire city center. Yet, the police officer in charge is unable to define the boundaries of the area. Instead, he threatens me with imprisonment in case of a violation.\n\nTwo conclusions Firstly, the police can, through underhanded singling out, pin a case on anyone who is outside their home, and that is probably the point of the action. Secondly, if this cannot be called fascism, where does it actually begin \u2013 or to put it another way, what more do we actually want to put up with?

        "Dr. Peter Marks, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), testifies to a Senate panel on Capitol Hill in Washington on May 11, 2021. (Jim Lo Scalzo/Pool/Getty Images)\n\nTop FDA Officials Concerned About Pressure to Authorize COVID-19 Vaccine Boosters: Emails\n\nTop officials at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were worried about what they saw as pressure being placed on them by vaccine companies and the White House to clear booster shots, according to newly released emails.\n\nDr. Marion Gruber, the director of the FDA\u2019s Office of Vaccines Research and Review (OVRR), said that she was \u201cvery concerned that companies (such as Pfizer and Janssen) are trying to put pressure on OVRR by way of PR,\u201d or public relations, in one of the missives.\n\n\u201cWe need to be given time to consider their data and cannot be pushed by these companies and, for that matter the Administration, who try to impose timeless [sic] that make no sense,\u201d Gruber told Dr. Peter Marks, the director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in the Aug. 25, 2021, email.\n\nThe 126 pages of emails, obtained and released (pdf) by the nonprofit Judicial Watch, show that there was increasing pressure on OVRR from both inside and outside the government to take action on requests for authorization for boosters.\n\nThe pressure was triggered in part by a joint statement signed by FDA Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock, longtime National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, and other Biden administration officials.\n\nThe group said that the protection from the COVID-19 vaccines were declining over time and that \u201ca booster shot will be needed to maximize vaccine-induced protection and prolong its durability.\u201d\n\nMarks was encouraging Moderna to submit a formal request for booster authorization Michelle Olsen, a Moderna executive, told Sudhakar Agnihothram, who worked under Gruber, via email two days later. Marks urged Moderna to file the request \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d according to the emails.\n\n\u2018Bite My Tongue\u2019\n\nIn a discussion around that time, Marks told staffers that \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t be doing rushed reviews anymore,\u201d Dr. Doran Fink, who also worked under Gruber, wrote to Gruber and others.\n\n\u201cI had to bite my tongue \u2026 so as not to ask about the booster doses that the administration promised to everyone by Sept 20!\u201d Fink wrote.\n\n\u201cHe keeps on telling me that following this approval, he will sit down with us to hammer out a plan to get on top of the workload because \u2018while I was gone he actually did an inventory and determined that our workload is no longer manageable\u2019\u2026\u2026at the same time he encourages sponsors to send in submissions and I am sure promises fast turn-around,\u201d Gruber responded.\n\nJohnson & Johnson also repeatedly emailed the FDA, asking for meetings to discuss data in preparation for submitting a booster authorization request. Karin Van Baelen of Moderna said that an executive was meeting with Marks and that Moderna had already made presentations to Fauci and Dr. Francis Collins, head of the National Institutes of Health. Gruber grew frustrated, culminating in the email to Marks.\n\nIn another message, Gruber pushed back when Marks messaged Fink to personally review work they were doing analyzing vaccine data, which Marks said was done at the behest of Woodcock.\n\n\u201cI am concerned and disappointed about the apparent lack of confidence and trust that Dr. Woodcock has in the OVRR team and that she has asked you to verify the information that we have provided to you in today\u2019s meeting and in the email sent to you by Doran this afternoon,\u201d Gruber said.\n\nEdits \u2018May be Rejected\u2019\n\nThe rush to get boosters cleared was prompted by the joint statement from the White House and other Biden administration officials, according to Van Baelen.\n\n\u201cIn view of the urgency created by the recent joint announcement by HHS and Medical Experts, we consider it important to be able to address the questions raised related to U.S. citizens who received the Janssen vaccine single dose regimen earlier this year as soon as possible,\u201d she said.\n\nGruber at one point reached out to international colleagues, lamenting the \u201ccrazy controversy and very strong push towards boosting vaccinees that I am seeing here in the U.S., the E.U., and a few other countries.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe message appears to be \u2018total buy-in in the need for boosters,'\u201d Gruber wrote in another email, asking for edits on a statement the FDA was preparing. \u201cThis is not how I am writing the BD, I am trying to take a more neutral approach. This piece sounds as if we already decided to approve this supplement.\u201d\n\nMaureen Hess, a colleague, said that she would make edits but noted that Woodcock signed onto the joint statement, \u201cso our edits may be rejected above us.\u201d\n\nGruber and Dr. Phil Krause, who was deputy director at OVRR, resigned from the FDA because of the disagreements over the need for boosters.\n\n\u201cYou had this corporate-government pressure on the civil servants who were over there and they objected so much, at least two of them resigned,\u201d Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, said on EpochTV.\n\nGruber, Krause, Moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe FDA, Marks, and Woodcock declined to comment.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s outside advisory panel challenged the administration\u2019s effort for boosters for all, voting only to recommend authorization of boosters for several subsets of Americans. However, the FDA soon bypassed the panel and authorized boosters for all adults, triggering public pushback from Krause and another former FDA scientist, Luciana Borio.\n\nSecond boosters have since been cleared for tens of millions of Americans because of the waning protection provided by the first booster, and there are signals that virtually all Americans will soon be advised to get second boosters.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misspelled the name of Dr. Fink.

        "Health care workers protest against NorthShore University HealthSystem's vaccine mandate outside Evanston Hospital in Evanston, Ill., on Oct. 12, 2021. (Cara Ding/The Epoch Times)\n\nHealth Care Workers Who Sued Over COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate Win $10 Million Settlement\n\nA group of health care workers who sued their hospital over a COVID-19 vaccine mandate are slated to receive $10 million, according to a settlement agreement filed on July 29.\n\nAbout a dozen workers at the NorthShore University HealthSystem in Illinois lodged the suit in October 2021, arguing that the facility was illegally not granting religious exemptions to the mandate.\n\nAfter eight months of negotiations, the workers and NorthShore \u201chave agreed to settle this case,\u201d according to a memorandum filed in federal court.\n\nUnder the settlement\u2019s terms, NorthShore will pay $10,337,500 into a settlement fund for workers affected by its mandate\u2014specifically, workers who between July 1, 2021, and Jan. 1, 2022, asked for a religious accommodation and were denied and either received a vaccine to avoid termination or were fired or resigned. About 473 workers fit under that category.\n\nNorthShore will also adjust its vaccine mandate \u201cto enhance its accommodation procedures for individuals with approved exemptions for sincerely held religious belief.\u201d\n\nWorkers fired because they refused to get vaccinated due to their religious beliefs are eligible to apply for re-employment.\n\nU.S. District Judge John Kness, the Trump appointee overseeing the case, was asked to approve the proposed settlement.\n\nLiberty Counsel, the legal group representing the platiniffs, described the settlement as a first-of-its-kind for an action against a private employer who denied hundreds of requests for religious exemptions to a COVID-19 vaccine mandate.\n\n\u201cThe drastic policy change and substantial monetary relief required by the settlement will bring a strong measure of justice to NorthShore\u2019s employees who were callously forced to choose between their conscience and their jobs,\u201d Horatio Mihet, vice president of legal affairs at the group, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis settlement should also serve as a strong warning to employers across the nation that they cannot refuse to accommodate those with sincere religious objections to forced vaccination mandates,\u201d he added.\n\nFund\n\nIf the agreement is approved, affected workers could apply for money from the $10 million fund.\n\nEach worker who eventually got a vaccine despite raising religious objections would be eligible for approximately $3,000 while those who were fired or resigned could get up to about $25,000, according to estimates.\n\nThe final amounts will depend on how many workers apply for money, among other factors.\n\nIn addition, the agreement sets aside $260,000 for the named plaintiffs in the case. Each would be slated to receive about $20,000, on top of the other funds.\n\nLiberty Counsel is also asking for $2 million in attorneys fees, or about 20 percent of the total settlement.",
        "Scientists keep reminding people that pathogens can become trapped on face masks and that the masks should be sterilized between use. So one popular question that has come up lately is, \u2018can ultraviolet (UV) light do the job?\u2019\n\nWe\u2019ve seen UV\u2019s powerful benefits before. Cutting-edge technology has been used to sterilize hospitals in state-of-the-art facilities for years. This technique even made headlines when Ebola was scaring the world.\n\nFrom LA Times:\n\nIdeally, single-use face masks should be worn once and then thrown away, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That\u2019s certainly true of the top-of-the-line N95 masks used by healthcare workers that are designed to filter out 95% of tiny particles when properly fitted to a wearer\u2019s face.\n\nBut last week, the CDC released new guidance on decontamination methods for emergency situations, such as the one healthcare workers are facing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Any disinfection process would need to kill the coronavirus without harming an N95 mask\u2019s ability to filter particles or fit snugly to the skin.\n\nUltraviolet germicidal radiation is one of the methods presented by the CDC, and UV light has generated great interest from the public. It\u2019s already used in hospitals to disinfect contaminated surfaces. And there\u2019s a fairly robust market of devices aimed at consumers, such as disinfectants for sleep apnea machines (although no such devices have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration so far). Other products purport to clean cellphones and disinfect water bottles.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at what ultraviolet light is and why it could be a useful tool in combating the coronavirus in certain situations.\n\nWhat is UV light?\n\nUltraviolet light, also known as UV light, is invisible to humans. Though it\u2019s adjacent to visible light on the electromagnetic spectrum, its wavelengths are just too short for our eyes to register and see.\n\nUV rays are also high-energy, so while we can\u2019t see them, we certainly feel their effects. For instance, ultraviolet light generated by the sun is what gives you a tan \u2014 or a sunburn. It can also lead to skin cancer.\n\nUltraviolet light falls into three categories, according to the World Health Organization:\n\n\u2022 UVA: This is the lowest-energy form of UV, and it accounts for about 95% of the ultraviolet light that reaches the Earth from the sun. It can penetrate deep into the skin\u2019s layers, which makes it responsible for the early tanning effect. It also contributes to skin aging, wrinkling and possibly skin cancer.\n\n\u2022 UVB: This higher-energy type of ultraviolet light can permeate the skin\u2019s superficial layers. It\u2019s responsible for delayed tanning (and burning), and is a big contributor to skin cancer and aging. Most of the UVB that comes our way is absorbed by the Earth\u2019s ozone layer, so it only makes up about 5% of the solar UV that reaches Earth.\n\n\u2022 UVC: The highest-energy category of ultraviolet light \u2014 any higher and you\u2019d be in X-ray territory \u2014 is also the most damaging. Luckily, the ozone layer and atmosphere completely absorb it.\n\nThe UV light used in medical disinfection devices is a particular wavelength of UVC.\n\nHow does UV disinfect stuff?\n\nUltraviolet light can penetrate the cells of pathogens and damage the DNA or RNA that contain their genetic code, said Jim Malley, an environmental engineer at the University of New Hampshire.\n\nThere\u2019s also some evidence that UV can damage the amino acids and proteins that either protect the virus or allow it to attach to and infect a host cell.\n\nSo it\u2019s already in use?\n\nYes. People have been disinfecting things with UV for more than a century, according to Ron Hofmann, an environmental engineer at the University of Toronto.\n\nMany experts say the first full-scale UV disinfection system for water treatment was used in Marseilles, France, in 1910, Malley said.\n\nModern UV devices come in a range of shapes and sizes. Some are not much bigger than cellphones. Others can be as large as a Cadillac Escalade \u2014 or multiple Escalades parked nose to bumper, in the case of the systems used to disinfect drinking water in Los Angeles and New York, Malley said.\n\nMany midsize UV machines \u2014 about the size of a large garbage bin \u2014 are used in hospitals to disinfect patients\u2019 rooms after they\u2019ve left.\n\nMore from new.yahoo.com\n\nFollow us\n\nShare this article",
        "Experts have repeatedly told us that the best way to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus is to avoid physical distance with sick people. But that\u2019s pretty difficult to achieve in modern society, where more than half the world\u2019s population lives in urban areas, using public transport, eating in the same restaurants, drinking together in pubs, and interacting in a myriad other ways every single day.\n\nSince the COVID-19 virus is so incredibly contagious, public areas frequented by large groups of people, as well as hospital rooms that have been used by sick patients, need to be carefully disinfected.\n\nRobots that can disinfect these areas by utilizing the power of the sun\u2019s ultraviolet rays are the latest weapon in the fight against the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nWhy ultraviolet light is the right weapon against COVID-19\n\nThe sun is an incredibly powerful natural disinfectant; its ultraviolet rays are strong enough to kill most harmful bacteria on exposed skin or clothing by destroying the nucleic acids in bacteria and other types of microbes.\n\nAs reported by The Epoch Times, concentrated UVC light has already been used for over five decades as an effective disinfectant in the manufacture of many different beverages, as well as for disinfecting fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, frozen foods and baked goods.\n\nNow, robots using this same type of light are being used to safely disinfect hospital rooms that have housed COVID-19 patients, as well as other public areas.\n\nAs reported by the BBC, though this technology has been available for some time, the coronavirus has \u201crocketed\u201d demand for these special robots.\n\nAn employee disinfects a Johannesburg, South Africa, hospital with a robot that emits ultraviolet light. (AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to Sam Ellison, vice president of UVD Robots, \u201ctruckloads\u201d of these robots have already been shipped to China, and more recently demand has escalated in other parts of the world.\n\nThe BBC reported:\n\nProduction has been accelerated and it now takes less than a day to make one robot at their facility in Odense, Denmark\u2019s third largest city and home to a growing robotics hub.\n\nGlowing like light sabres, eight bulbs emit concentrated UV-C ultraviolet light. This destroys bacteria, viruses and other harmful microbes by damaging their DNA and RNA, so they can\u2019t multiply. \u2026\n\nThe job is done in 10-20 minutes. Afterwards there\u2019s a smell, much like burned hair.\n\nAs explained by The Epoch Times, Klaran, another firm that specializes in UVC LED products, has developed a robot that uses wavelengths between 200 and 280 nanometers (UVC) to effectively disinfect against pathogens.\n\nAnd Dimer UVC Innovation, based in Los Angeles, has developed a robot that can disinfect up to 10 hospital rooms in a single hour.\n\nThe Epoch Times reported:\n\nDimer just announced that it will offer GermFalcon robots designed to autonomously navigate through airplane cabins and passenger terminal waiting areas to strategically \u2018kill viruses, bacteria, and superbugs\u2019 on high-touch surfaces.\n\nCo-founder Elliot Kreitenberg stated the Dimer germ-killing system will participate in the coronavirus emergency response efforts at the Los Angeles International Airport, San Francisco International Airport, and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.\n\nProf Hans J\u00f8rn Kolmos, a professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Southern Denmark, explains that many different organisms can cause infections, but that the correct dose of ultraviolet light, applied for an appropriate length of time, will kill most of them.\n\nHe added, \u201cThis type of disinfection can also be applied to epidemic situations, like the one we experience right now, with coronavirus disease.\u201d\n\nSources:\n\nTheepochtimes.com\n\nBBC.com\n\nCredit: Naturalnews.com\n\nImage: Flickr/NIAID\n\nFollow us\n\nShare this article",
        "China has intentionally fabricated the number of coronavirus cases and deaths that the country suffered, according to a new report.\n\nThe country faked numbers on purpose, the American intelligence community concluded in a classified report given to the White House last week, Bloomberg News reported, citing three U.S. officials.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s public reporting on cases and deaths is intentionally incomplete,\u201d the outlet reported. \u201cTwo of the officials said the report concludes that China\u2019s numbers are fake.\u201d\n\nAs of Wednesday, China \u2014 the epicenter of the global pandemic \u2014 has claimed to have under 83,000 cases and around 3,300 deaths.\n\nThat\u2019s significantly less than the U.S., which as reported more than 200,000, or Italy with 110,000, or Spain with 102,000.\n\nIn recent weeks, Wuhan has reported no new cases almost every day, a drop from the thousands it reported every day until mid-February, and the hundreds into early March.\n\nDeborah Birx, the State Department immunologist on the Coronavirus Task Force, said on Tuesday that China\u2019s data was interpreted by the medical community as: \u201cThis was serious, but smaller than anyone expected.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I think probably we were missing a significant amount of the data, now that we see what happened to Italy and see what happened to Spain.\u201d\n\nMore from the-sun.com\n\nFollow us\n\nShare this article",
        "As you know, a novel coronavirus (initially labeled 2019-nCOV before being renamed COVID-19 by the World Health Organization1) originating in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in China, is rapidly spreading across the world.\n\nThe first case was reported in Wuhan on December 21, 2019. Symptoms include fever, shortness of breath, severe cough and pneumonia which, in more severe cases, can lead to impaired kidney and liver function and kidney failure.2,3\n\nOn January 21, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first U.S. case4 \u2014 a patient in Washington state who had recently visited Wuhan. Then, the first U.S. death was reported February 29, 2020, in Washington state.5\n\nLess than a week later, CBS News reported March 5, 2020, that the number of deaths had quickly risen to 11 nationwide in the U.S. \u2014 10 in Washington state and one in California.6 Not only that, but as of that day, \u201cThe World Health Organization urged governments around the world to pull out \u2018all the stops\u2019\u201d to fight the outbreak. On the up side, China \u201cappeared to be over the worst\u201d of it, CBS said.\n\nAll told, as of March 5, 2020, there were 98,067 reported cases of novel coronavirus infections affecting 88 countries, 80,430 of which were in China. Worldometer.info provides an easy overview of confirmed cases and deaths that you can check for the latest statistics.7\n\nCOVID-19 \u2014 A Weaponized Coronavirus?\n\nIn this interview, Francis Boyle \u2014 whose background includes an undergraduate degree from the University of Chicago, a juris doctor (lawyer) degree from Harvard and a Ph.D. in political science \u2014 shares his theory of the origin of this novel coronavirus.\n\nFor decades, he\u2019s advocated against the development and use of bioweapons, which he suspects COVID-19 is. In fact, Boyle was the one who called for biowarfare legislation at the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972, and the one who drafted the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, which was passed unanimously by both houses of Congress and signed into law by George Bush, Sr.\n\nAt the time of this recording, February 14, 2020, more than 50,000 people in China had been infected with the virus. Certainly, it does not originate from infected bat soup.\n\nAs a result of Boyle\u2019s antibiological warfare work, which goes back to the early days of the Reagan administration \u2014 a time in which they were using DNA genetic engineering to manufacture biological weapons \u2014 Boyle has carefully followed \u201cmysterious outbreaks of disease in both humans and animals around the world\u201d that have appeared since then.\n\n\u201cMy biowarfare antiterrorism act was specifically designed to not only to deal with regular biological weapons but also with DNA genetic engineering for biological weapons that was just coming into its infancy when the BWC was being drafted.\n\nEven though the BWC would cover DNA genetic engineering, I wanted to make it clear by name that it was covered. I also made it clear [that] it covered synthetic biology as well,\u201d Boyle says.\n\n\u201cSo, when these unexplained mysterious illnesses break out, I monitor them a while and usually I just conclude they can be explained by normal reasons: lack of sanitation, poverty, things of that nature. But in Wuhan it seemed pretty suspicious to me.\n\nThere is this Biosafety Level 4 facility there in Wuhan. It\u2019s the first in China, and it was specifically set up to deal with the coronavirus and SARS. SARS is basically a weaponized version of the coronavirus.\n\nThere have been leaks before of SARS out of this facility, and indeed the only reason for these BSL-4 facilities, based on my experience, is the research, development, testing and stockpiling of offensive biological weapons.\n\nFor that reason, I stated my opinion: That this Wuhan coronavirus leaked out of that BSL-4 facility \u2026 maybe mid-November \u2026 and the Chinese government has been lying about it and covering up ever since.\u201d\n\nMany Unknowns Remain\n\nThe first reported case of COVID-19 infection was December 1, 2019. Depending on the incubation period, which is still unknown, the initial lead, provided there was one, might have occurred anywhere in November. The official estimate is a 14-day incubation period, but a British health expert believes it\u2019s 24 days, and North Korean biological warfare experts believe it\u2019s 30 days, Boyle says.\n\n\u201cAs for Wuhan and Hubei Province, they\u2019re basically under martial law. There\u2019s no other word for it. If you read the statements by President Xi and his assistants, they\u2019ve made it very clear they\u2019re at war here, and that is correct. They\u2019re at war with their own biological warfare agent.\n\nPresident Xi just fired the party apparatchiks in charge of this and has brought in trusted military personnel to handle it, as well as large numbers of PLA [People\u2019s Liberation Army] forces saying they\u2019re health care workers. They don\u2019t look like health care workers to me. So, as of now, that\u2019s my best reading of the situation.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about rumors the COVID-19 virus might have been stolen from a high-security laboratory in Winnipeg, Canada, Boyle says:\n\n\u201cIt could have been. I want to make it clear that, in my opinion they were already working on that at the Wuhan BSL-4 facility. They were working on a biological warfare weapon involving SARS, which is a coronavirus to begin with.\n\nWe do know that Dr. [Yoshihiro] Kawaoka at the University of Wisconsin \u2026 resurrected the Spanish flu virus for the Pentagon, obviously for weapons purposes, and he specializes in mating the Spanish flu virus to all sorts of hideous biowarfare instrumentalities. And there was a record of him shipping his products to Winnipeg.\n\nWinnipeg is Canada\u2019s equivalent of our own Fort Detrick. It\u2019s a BSL-4 facility, and yes, they research, develop tests, manufacture and stockpile every type of hideous biological warfare weapon that we know of. So, some of this technology could have been stolen from Winnipeg. I don\u2019t know about that but, as I said, the Wuhan BSL-4 was already working on this to begin with.\n\nThey had already developed SARS. SARS had leaked out two to three times before this, and it seems they were turbocharging SARS, which is what [COVID-19] looks to be. This is a brand-new generation of biowarfare weapons we haven\u2019t seen before.\n\nIts lethality goes from 15%, as estimated by Lancet, up to 17% to 18% by a British health official and even Chinese statistics. Its infectivity is 83%. It can infect maybe three to four people for every person infected.\n\nIt has gain of function properties, which means it travels through air at least 6 or 7 feet, and \u2026 there are reports that even contaminated human feces give it off, that the human feces radiate off maybe 6 or 7 feet. So, we\u2019ve never seen anything like this before in the history of biological warfare, at least in the public record.\n\nI want to make it clear: I have never worked for the United States government. I\u2019ve never had a security clearance. I\u2019ve never had access to any type of secret information.\n\nI just read what is in the public record and the scientific record and try to draw my own conclusions, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m giving you today. I could change my opinion if people can provide me reputable scientific evidence to the contrary.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m standing by my conclusion that it leaked out of the Wuhan BSL-4, the highest level of the Chinese government has known about it, they\u2019ve been covering it up from the get-go, until they informed the WHO at the end of December.\u201d\n\nDespite Laws, Biowarfare Experimentation Is Alive and Well\n\nAs noted by Boyle, the Wuhan lab is a designated WHO research lab, which may sound odd, considering these facilities specialize in developing and researching dangerous pathogens that can easily be turned into bioweapons.\n\nAccording to Boyle, we should not be surprised however, as \u201cWHO is up to its eyeballs in this type of work and has been for quite some time.\u201d The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the drug industry also appear to have had their hand in many of the outbreaks of what appear to be weaponized viruses.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t go through the long history of big pharma getting involved in this. There\u2019s huge amounts of money here. I believe the West Africa Ebola pandemic originated out of the US BSL-4 facility in Sierra Leone, and [that] they were testing out a so-called vaccine that contained live Ebola and gave it to these poor people,\u201d Boyle says.\n\n\u201cAs for the CDC, it has been involved in every \u2026 BSL-4 biological warfare death science you could possibly imagine \u2026 It\u2019s a matter of public record that during the Reagan administration, the CDC and the American Type Culture Collection sent 40 shipments of weapons-grade biological warfare agents to Saddam Hussein in Iraq, in the hope and expectation that he would weaponize these agents and use them against Iran \u2026\n\nOf course, the problem is that when that war was over \u2026 an order was given to U.S. military forces to blow up Saddam Hussein\u2019s biological warfare facilities, and that\u2019s not how you deal with biological warfare weapons \u2026\n\n[It] contaminated our own troops, and that was a causative factor in the Gulf War Syndrome that \u2026 murdered about 11,000 U.S. troops and disabled about 100,000.\u201d\n\nAccording to Boyle, the U.S. government spent $100 billion on biological warfare programs since September 11, 2011, up until October 2015, which is no small sum. To put it into perspective, the U.S. spent $40 billion (assuming a constant dollar value) on the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb. Boyle also estimates the U.S. has some 13,000 life scientists working within the biowarfare industry.\n\n\u201cClearly, the Reagan administration, under the influence of its neoconservatives who definitely believe in biological weapons and ethnic-specific biological weapons (you can see that in the PNAC report), were engaged in the use of DNA genetic engineering for the purpose of manufacturing biological weapons.\n\nThat is why I gave a Congressional briefing in Washington, D.C. in 1985. I was asked to do that by the Council for Responsible Genetics that I work with, which involves the leading life scientists in the world from MIT and Harvard.\n\nI spent seven years at Harvard. I have three degrees and I knew all these people. They asked me to serve as their lawyer and give this Congressional briefing. I blew the whistle, and then they asked me to draft the implementing legislation, which I did \u2026\n\nI want to make it clear I\u2019m not here to speak in their name, I\u2019m only speaking in my name, but if you look at my book, \u2018Biological Warfare and Terrorism,\u2019 professor Jonathan King wrote the foreword. So, I have the leading MIT professor of molecular biology supporting what I\u2019m saying, if you don\u2019t think I know enough science about it.\u201d\n\nUS Prepares for COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nWhile there have so far only been a limited number of reported cases of COVID-19 infection in the U.S., the U.S. military has designated several detention sites around the country to quarantine Americans,8 should the situation take a turn for the worse.\n\nHistorically speaking, however, government health officials have been vastly exaggerating the threat of pandemics in the U.S., including the bird flu, the swine flu, anthrax and Ebola.\n\nFor example, as detailed in my 2009 New York Times bestseller \u201cThe Great Bird Flu Hoax,\u201d then-President George Bush Jr. projected 2 million Americans would die from bird flu; the best-case scenario taking only 200,000 lives. The final death count in the U.S. from that pandemic was zero.\n\nIt generated massive profits, though, as U.S. taxpayer dollars were used to purchase 20 million doses of Tamiflu. One of the people who was able to line his pockets from that hoax was defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who was president of Gilead Sciences when the drug was created.\n\n\u201c[The bird flu] was another DNA, genetically engineered biological warfare weapon,\u201d Boyle notes. \u201cIt was a chimera. It had three different elements in it and we were all lucky that somehow they attenuated the lethality and the infectiveness of the bird flu.\u201d\n\nWhether or not COVID-19 will be similarly ineffective in its spread and lethality remains to be seen. Judging by the statistics in China, \u201cit doesn\u2019t look very good,\u201d Boyle says.\n\nUnderstanding the COVID-19 Virus\n\nAccording to Boyle, the COVID-19 virus is a chimera, like the avian flu virus before it. It includes SARS, an already weaponized coronavirus, along with HIV genetic material. \u201cThat was in a published article by Indian scientists. You could see the pictures right there, [but] political pressure was brought to bear upon them so they withdrew [the paper].\u201d\n\nThis is why some scientists are now looking into using HIV drugs to treat it,9 Boyle says. COVID-19 may also have a flu virus mixed in, along with gain of function properties that allow it to spread a greater distance than normal.\n\nPandemics Repeatedly Used to Further Police State\n\nPandemics have also been used to chip away public freedoms. For example, the anthrax scare of 2001 was used as the impetus for signing the Patriot Act, which was the first step in taking away many of our personal freedoms and rolling out a complete surveillance state. To me, such outcomes are far more concerning than the risk of infection itself. Boyle adds:\n\n\u201cThey used Amerithrax to ram the Patriot Act through, that is correct \u2026 We became a police state \u2026 And as I pointed out in \u2018Biowarfare and Terrorism,\u2019 I think the same people who were behind the 9/11 terrorist attack were also behind the Amerithrax, but I\u2019m just connecting dots there \u2026\n\nWhat\u2019s called Amerithrax came out of a U.S. government biological warfare weapons lab and program, and I publicly blew the whistle on that the first weekend of November 2001.\n\nThe Council for Responsible Genetics was having its convention at Harvard Business School and I was chairing a panel with King and other experts on biological warfare, on U.S. biological warfare programs.\n\nAs I was walking into the Harvard Divinity School, Fox TV had a camera crew there and I said, \u2018Obviously, this came out a U.S. biological weapons program and probably Fort Detrick.\u2019\n\nI conducted the session and made the same comment. Then I made a comment to a Washington, D.C., radio station to that effect [and to] the BBC, so everyone in the world heard me.\n\nAt that point, someone gave an order that I was never to be interviewed again by any mainstream news about biological warfare programs. And that\u2019s been the case since the first week of November 2001.\u201d\n\nAs noted by Boyle, George Orwell\u2019s book, \u201c1984,\u201d has become reality. Boyle has since lectured lawyers at DePaul Law School in Chicago about the totalitarian nature of the Patriot Act.\n\n\u201cSnowden has correctly pointed out the federal government is spying on everything we say, all of our electronic communications, you name it,\u201d Boyle says.\n\n\u201cAnd again, the proof is I\u2019ve been completely blackballed out of U.S. media. Indeed, if you go back and look at the Amerithrax attacks, they also hit mainstream U.S. media to make it clear to them that if they covered this issue they will be killed too.\u201d\n\nBioweapons Are Developed To Be Used\n\nAs noted by Boyle, the U.S. government has a large stockpile of Amerithrax \u2014 a super weapons-grade nanotechnology anthrax with 1 trillion spores per gram \u2014 and that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg of the biological weapons developed. What\u2019s more, Boyle has no doubt these weapons will eventually be put to use, as they have in the past. He says:\n\n\u201cThere was a tabletop exercise at John Hopkins University last fall \u2026 on coronavirus.10Tabletop exercise, that\u2019s a euphemism for a war game. Their estimate was that it killed 65 million people11 \u2026\n\nJohn Hopkins is up to their eyeballs in this Nazi biological warfare dirty work. They have a BSL-3 facility there \u2026 that they proudly announce on their website \u2026 They justify it by saying they\u2019re developing vaccines. OK \u2026 How do they do that?\n\nThey go out around the world, and this is a matter of public record, and scour for every type of hideous disease, fungus, virus and bacteria you can possibly imagine. They then bring it back to these BSL-4 labs and develop an offensive, biological agent using DNA genetic engineering and synthetic biology \u2026 set up by the Pentagon under DARPA \u2026\n\nOnce they have this offensive agent, they then proceed to develop a vaccine, because the agent is no good unless you can have a vaccine to protect your own people.\n\nSo, they\u2019re developing vaccines to have biological weapons, because a biological weapon consists of two elements: the offensive biological warfare agent in the first place, and then, second, a vaccine to protect your own people, and that is what is being done at all these BSL-4 facilities, and many of the BSL-3s as well.\n\nJohn Hopkins has a BSL-3 and they admit they do dual use. That\u2019s what dual use means. They first develop the offensive biological warfare agent and then they develop the supposed vaccine.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Johns Hopkins University is the biggest recipient of research grants from federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation and Department of Defense. It has also received millions of dollars in research grants from the Gates Foundation.12 In 2016, Johns Hopkins spent more than $2 billion on research projects, leading all U.S. universities in research spending for the 38th year in a row.13\n\nHow Can We Best Prevent or Treat COVID-19 Infection?\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear exactly which treatment is the most effective, my guess is that Dr. Paul Marik\u2019s intravenous vitamin C protocol for sepsis would be a good starting point, seeing how sepsis appears to be what kills those who succumb to a serious COVID-19 infection.\n\nMarik\u2019s retrospective before-after clinical study14,15 showed that giving patients IV vitamin C with hydrocortisone and vitamin B1 for two days reduced mortality from 40% to 8.5%. The precise protocol used was 200 mg of thiamine every 12 hours, 1,500 mg of ascorbic acid every six hours, and 50 mg of hydrocortisone every six hours.16 Importantly, the treatment has no side effects and is inexpensive, readily available and simple to administer.\n\nAccording to Marik, vitamin C and corticosteroids have a synergistic effect,17 which is part of why his combo protocol is so effective. Still, simply using high-dose IV vitamin C exclusively has been shown to improve survival in patients with sepsis and acute respiratory failure, reducing mortality from 46% to 30%.18\n\nIt also reduced the number of days they needed to remain hospitalized. On average, those who received vitamin C had by Day 28 spent three fewer days in the intensive care unit than the placebo group (seven days compared to 10). By Day 60, the treatment group had also spent seven fewer days in the hospital overall \u201415 days compared to 22.19\n\nWhile there are no trials that look at integrating hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), my suspicion is that this would provide a powerful synergy that could get the fatality rate from sepsis even closer to zero. Sadly, HBOT is not available at many hospitals, and even if it were, it is not approved for sepsis.\n\nYou can learn more about Marik\u2019s sepsis protocol in \u201cVitamin C \u2014 A Game Changer in Treatment of Deadly Sepsis,\u201d along with commonsense recommendations for how to lower your risk of sepsis in the first place.\n\nYou can also review Marik\u2019s PowerPoint presentation, \u201cHydrocortisone, Ascorbic Acid and Thiamine for the Treatment of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock,\u201d presented at the 2020 Critical Care Reviews meeting in Australia.

        "United States hospitals have observed some new symptoms that are not included in the list made available by the CDC. Scientists continue to learn more about the virus as it spreads. There are now over 100,000 reported cases in the U.S. with 1715 deaths.\n\nAccording to Chinese data, cases of infection in the US surpassed China where the outbreak originated. China says it only has 81,394 infections as of today 3/28/20. Some have questioned whether or not the Chinese government is being honest about their coronavirus data. Indeed, the Communist Party of China has a history of lying about and covering-up issues they believe paint them in a negative light.\n\nAlthough the sudden jump in active cases in the U.S. might alarm Americans. This sudden jump in positive cases has a lot to do with the rollout of coronavirus tests. Furthermore this gives scientists an opportunity to look at the virus in more subjects and learn a great deal about how to beat it.\n\nExperts say that the proliferation of coronavirus cases in the United States has provided them with new insight regarding how the disease can affect certain populations.\n\nFrom International Business Times:\n\nA New Symptom\n\nThe throng of patients being admitted to U.S. hospitals has alerted medical personnel to a new symptom. People going to hospitals have complained of feeling stomach pain, a symptom that has not been included in the list of coronavirus symptoms.\n\nMichael Hirsh, the director of public health in Worcester, Massachusetts, said that hospitals are now admitting patients who tested positive for coronavirus having only abdominal pain as their symptom. Dr. Hirsh said that what they are seeing are patients coming in no so much having respiratory complaints but with abdominal pains.\n\nStomach Pain And Pneumonia\n\nAccording to Dr. Hirsch, the pain they feel in their tummy is caused by the development of pneumonia located in the lower lobes of the patients\u2019 lungs. If these lobes are frequently inflamed, the irritation in their diaphragm can cause pain in their abdominal area.\n\nDr. Hirsch, who is also a general surgeon, said that the more they see the disease, the better they learn about it. He said that as time goes by, scientists are going to see some manifestations of the disease that did not fit that classic symptom of fever and dry hacking cough.\n\nNo Respiratory Symptoms\n\nThe general surgeon revealed that many of the COVID-19 patients suffering from abdominal pain did not have any respiratory symptoms. Although at the moment, there is inadequate data they can use to map out trustworthy patterns, it appears that it is the younger patients who report stomach pain. On the other hand, it is the older patients who show respiratory symptoms.\n\nAccording to health experts, common symptoms of COVID-19 are having a high temperature, shortness of breathing, and a new, continuous cough. Some patients reported having diarrhea and suffering from conjunctivitis (pink eye), which health experts later on attributed to coronavirus infection.\n\nSources:\n\nIBTimes.com\n\nworldometers.info/coronavirus/country/US\n\nrealfarmacy.com\n\nworldometers.info/coronavirus\n\nCDC.gov\n\nImages: U.S. Army photo by Reese Brown\n\nAndrea Canali EFE\n\nFollow us\n\nShare this article",
        "By Catherine Yang, The Epoch Times\n\nWhile The Epoch Times began publishing reports of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus on Jan. 2, most outlets had yet to pick up on the story because of the CCP\u2019s lockdown on information. Three months later, over 200 countries and territories have been infected and the CCP virus has caused over 85,000 deaths infecting at least 1.4 million, but information is murkier than ever.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve pretty much heard every rumor under the sun. We\u2019ve heard every theory, every crazy rumor, we\u2019ve heard all these different narratives,\u201d said Joshua Philipp, award-winning investigative reporter and host of the show \u201cCrossroads.\u201d\n\nThe rumors aren\u2019t by accident: The CCP has been actively engaging in a disinformation campaign, and media outlets around the world have parroted the propaganda. As a result, entire nations have been operating under false information as they try to battle the pandemic within their borders.\n\nScreenshot of the documentary \u201cTracking Down the Origin of Wuhan Coronavirus.\u201d (Courtesy Epoch Times)\n\nPhilipp and his colleages at The Epoch Times and NTD Television thought it their responsibility to sift through all the information available, verify it, and put it into one place. The result is the just-premiered documentary \u201cTracking Down the Origin of the Wuhan Coronavirus,\u201d which is available to watch online. Less than two days after its premiere, the documentary has around 1.6 million views across different platforms.\n\nThe film \u201creally tries to sift through all of the rumors, all of the truths, all of the falsehoods, and show people as accurate a picture as possible of what really happened and where this virus actually came from,\u201d Philipp said.\n\nIn it, Philipp pieces together the development of the virus and includes interviews that shed light on the Chinese regime\u2019s actions and intentions.\n\nLives at Stake\n\nIt should be very telling that the nine-person panel the CCP created to address the pandemic, once it finally acknowledged the virus in January, is filled with propaganda officials, said China affairs columnist Gordon Chang in the documentary.\n\nMany countries have accepted or bought faulty equipment from China, for example, and \u201cthey\u2019re getting duped,\u201dPhilipp said.\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, this is because they don\u2019t understand the Chinese Communist Party, they don\u2019t understand how [the CCP] works, and, even as we speak right now, the Chinese Communist Party is claiming it\u2019s over in China when it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nChina affairs columnist Gordon Chang. (Courtesy of Epoch Times)\n\n\u201cAnd what that means is, as they open things up and reopen flights, there\u2019s a major risk to other countries,\u201d Philipp said. \u201cIf [these countries] don\u2019t have accurate information, then what can they base their information on?\u201d\n\nAs the documentary shows, the CCP\u2019s delay in sharing information about the virus with other countries was not mere oversight. And beyond covering up the epidemic, China\u2019s current actions and disinformation continues to endanger lives around the globe. The CCP has gone from denying the existence of the virus to spreading as many lies as it can to obscure the truth.\n\n\u201cThis is an issue of human life,\u201d Philipp said.\n\nWhy Would the CCP Lie?\n\nFrom the beginning, the CCP has not been forthcoming.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s there, but the fact that the Communist Party is covering this up should trouble us deeply,\u201d Chang said.\n\nThose unfamiliar with the CCP will likely be shocked to discover the regime\u2019s motives.\n\nPhilipp\u2019s investigation of the CCP virus in this documentary goes back to the outbreak of SARS nearly two decades ago. The CCP tried to cover up the SARS outbreak as well, and The Epoch Times was one of the few media to expose this. There is precedent of the regime being untrustworthy in the event of an epidemic.\n\nPhilipp has been researching the CCP since 2008, and gave an example of its military approach to shed light on how the CCP can profit off this pandemic most consider a tragedy.\n\n\u201cOne important thing to understand is they talk about war without morals. They talk about \u2018unrestricted warfare\u2019: war that does not take into account any concept of human rights, human dignity, human life. It is victory by any means. There is nothing they will not do, and we see the same thing in many parts of their system, including the medical system where altering the human genome is not a big deal to them,\u201dPhilipp said.\n\nThe documentary\u2019s experts remind us: this is a nation that currently holds at least 1 million of its own people in concentration camps.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t care about human life when it comes to this regime\u2014we\u2019ve seen that in their human rights abuses,\u201d Philipp said.\n\nEpoch Times investigative journalist Joshua Philipp. (Courtesy of Epoch Times)\n\nThe documentary shows another link to SARS, and how one of China\u2019s top virus experts\u2019 study of SARS at the Wuhan Institute of Virology led to breakthroughs in creating a coronavirus to infect humans. But to what end?\n\n\u201cThe Chinese Communist Party has been very open about its biological warfare ambitions, they don\u2019t even try to hide it. And it\u2019s been a huge injustice that people have not held them to stronger account than they should have, because the Chinese Communist Party is able to act with impunity and nobody criticizes what they do,\u201d Philipp said.\n\nThe documentary is a comprehensive look at what the virus is and what has happened, and Philipp hopes it can allow nations to make better-informed decisions.\n\nDr. Sean Lin, former lab director of the viral disease branch at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. (Courtesy of Epoch Times)\n\n\u201cAt the very least, we can provide this as a package of information that will inform the entire world exactly where this virus came from, and exactly what needs to be done going forward,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd at the very least, they will be more cautious when dealing with the Chinese Communist Party, especially at this time.\u201d \u201cPeople\u2019s lives are at stake and we find it very necessary to do this kind of work,\u201d he said.\n\nTalking Points\n\nThe information is perhaps more vital than ever, because while countries are turning to the World Health Organization for information, WHO is turning to the CCP.\n\nGeneral Robert Spalding, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and former National Security Council senior strategy director, was in China when SARS broke out; he was evacuated, but he knows what a cover-up looks like. How the CCP handled the SARS cover-up is exactly how they have handled this one. He is among several experts who say the CCP clearly has no intention of ending the epidemic or curing the virus.\n\nSenior investigative Epoch Times reporter Joshua Philipp in New York City. (Courtesy of Epoch Times)\n\n\u201cYou can see that the WHO is essentially following the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s guidelines,\u201d Spalding said.\n\nThe WHO isn\u2019t the only organization doing so; international organizations to individual academic institutions around the world are afraid to say something that may anger the CCP. In recent weeks, Philipp had reached out many well-known scientists who once suggested the virus causing this mysterious COVID-19 disease was created in a lab, but they no longer wanted to talk.\n\nFrom the beginning, the CCP prevented organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from studying the origin of COVID-19, Gordon Chang said.\n\nThe CCP\u2019s actions speak to a problem deeper than the virus.\n\n\u201cEvery country has diseases, but in China they become national emergencies and global emergencies, because the real disease here is communism,\u201d Chang said.\n\nWatch the complete documentary below:\n\nSource: The Epoch Times\n\nFollow us\n\nShare this article",
        "As you know, a novel coronavirus (initially labeled 2019-nCOV before being renamed COVID-19 by the World Health Organization1) originating in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in China, is rapidly spreading across the world.\n\nThe first case was reported in Wuhan on December 21, 2019. Symptoms include fever, shortness of breath, severe cough and pneumonia which, in more severe cases, can lead to impaired kidney and liver function and kidney failure.2,3\n\nOn January 21, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first U.S. case4 \u2014 a patient in Washington state who had recently visited Wuhan. Then, the first U.S. death was reported February 29, 2020, in Washington state.5\n\nLess than a week later, CBS News reported March 5, 2020, that the number of deaths had quickly risen to 11 nationwide in the U.S. \u2014 10 in Washington state and one in California.6 Not only that, but as of that day, \u201cThe World Health Organization urged governments around the world to pull out \u2018all the stops\u2019\u201d to fight the outbreak. On the up side, China \u201cappeared to be over the worst\u201d of it, CBS said.\n\nAll told, as of March 5, 2020, there were 98,067 reported cases of novel coronavirus infections affecting 88 countries, 80,430 of which were in China. Worldometer.info provides an easy overview of confirmed cases and deaths that you can check for the latest statistics.7\n\nCOVID-19 \u2014 A Weaponized Coronavirus?\n\nIn this interview, Francis Boyle \u2014 whose background includes an undergraduate degree from the University of Chicago, a juris doctor (lawyer) degree from Harvard and a Ph.D. in political science \u2014 shares his theory of the origin of this novel coronavirus.\n\nFor decades, he\u2019s advocated against the development and use of bioweapons, which he suspects COVID-19 is. In fact, Boyle was the one who called for biowarfare legislation at the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972, and the one who drafted the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, which was passed unanimously by both houses of Congress and signed into law by George Bush, Sr.\n\nAt the time of this recording, February 14, 2020, more than 50,000 people in China had been infected with the virus. Certainly, it does not originate from infected bat soup.\n\nAs a result of Boyle\u2019s antibiological warfare work, which goes back to the early days of the Reagan administration \u2014 a time in which they were using DNA genetic engineering to manufacture biological weapons \u2014 Boyle has carefully followed \u201cmysterious outbreaks of disease in both humans and animals around the world\u201d that have appeared since then.\n\n\u201cMy biowarfare antiterrorism act was specifically designed to not only to deal with regular biological weapons but also with DNA genetic engineering for biological weapons that was just coming into its infancy when the BWC was being drafted.\n\nEven though the BWC would cover DNA genetic engineering, I wanted to make it clear by name that it was covered. I also made it clear [that] it covered synthetic biology as well,\u201d Boyle says.\n\n\u201cSo, when these unexplained mysterious illnesses break out, I monitor them a while and usually I just conclude they can be explained by normal reasons: lack of sanitation, poverty, things of that nature. But in Wuhan it seemed pretty suspicious to me.\n\nThere is this Biosafety Level 4 facility there in Wuhan. It\u2019s the first in China, and it was specifically set up to deal with the coronavirus and SARS. SARS is basically a weaponized version of the coronavirus.\n\nThere have been leaks before of SARS out of this facility, and indeed the only reason for these BSL-4 facilities, based on my experience, is the research, development, testing and stockpiling of offensive biological weapons.\n\nFor that reason, I stated my opinion: That this Wuhan coronavirus leaked out of that BSL-4 facility \u2026 maybe mid-November \u2026 and the Chinese government has been lying about it and covering up ever since.\u201d\n\nMany Unknowns Remain\n\nThe first reported case of COVID-19 infection was December 1, 2019. Depending on the incubation period, which is still unknown, the initial lead, provided there was one, might have occurred anywhere in November. The official estimate is a 14-day incubation period, but a British health expert believes it\u2019s 24 days, and North Korean biological warfare experts believe it\u2019s 30 days, Boyle says.\n\n\u201cAs for Wuhan and Hubei Province, they\u2019re basically under martial law. There\u2019s no other word for it. If you read the statements by President Xi and his assistants, they\u2019ve made it very clear they\u2019re at war here, and that is correct. They\u2019re at war with their own biological warfare agent.\n\nPresident Xi just fired the party apparatchiks in charge of this and has brought in trusted military personnel to handle it, as well as large numbers of PLA [People\u2019s Liberation Army] forces saying they\u2019re health care workers. They don\u2019t look like health care workers to me. So, as of now, that\u2019s my best reading of the situation.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about rumors the COVID-19 virus might have been stolen from a high-security laboratory in Winnipeg, Canada, Boyle says:\n\n\u201cIt could have been. I want to make it clear that, in my opinion they were already working on that at the Wuhan BSL-4 facility. They were working on a biological warfare weapon involving SARS, which is a coronavirus to begin with.\n\nWe do know that Dr. [Yoshihiro] Kawaoka at the University of Wisconsin \u2026 resurrected the Spanish flu virus for the Pentagon, obviously for weapons purposes, and he specializes in mating the Spanish flu virus to all sorts of hideous biowarfare instrumentalities. And there was a record of him shipping his products to Winnipeg.\n\nWinnipeg is Canada\u2019s equivalent of our own Fort Detrick. It\u2019s a BSL-4 facility, and yes, they research, develop tests, manufacture and stockpile every type of hideous biological warfare weapon that we know of. So, some of this technology could have been stolen from Winnipeg. I don\u2019t know about that but, as I said, the Wuhan BSL-4 was already working on this to begin with.\n\nThey had already developed SARS. SARS had leaked out two to three times before this, and it seems they were turbocharging SARS, which is what [COVID-19] looks to be. This is a brand-new generation of biowarfare weapons we haven\u2019t seen before.\n\nIts lethality goes from 15%, as estimated by Lancet, up to 17% to 18% by a British health official and even Chinese statistics. Its infectivity is 83%. It can infect maybe three to four people for every person infected.\n\nIt has gain of function properties, which means it travels through air at least 6 or 7 feet, and \u2026 there are reports that even contaminated human feces give it off, that the human feces radiate off maybe 6 or 7 feet. So, we\u2019ve never seen anything like this before in the history of biological warfare, at least in the public record.\n\nI want to make it clear: I have never worked for the United States government. I\u2019ve never had a security clearance. I\u2019ve never had access to any type of secret information.\n\nI just read what is in the public record and the scientific record and try to draw my own conclusions, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m giving you today. I could change my opinion if people can provide me reputable scientific evidence to the contrary.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m standing by my conclusion that it leaked out of the Wuhan BSL-4, the highest level of the Chinese government has known about it, they\u2019ve been covering it up from the get-go, until they informed the WHO at the end of December.\u201d\n\nDespite Laws, Biowarfare Experimentation Is Alive and Well\n\nAs noted by Boyle, the Wuhan lab is a designated WHO research lab, which may sound odd, considering these facilities specialize in developing and researching dangerous pathogens that can easily be turned into bioweapons.\n\nAccording to Boyle, we should not be surprised however, as \u201cWHO is up to its eyeballs in this type of work and has been for quite some time.\u201d The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the drug industry also appear to have had their hand in many of the outbreaks of what appear to be weaponized viruses.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t go through the long history of big pharma getting involved in this. There\u2019s huge amounts of money here. I believe the West Africa Ebola pandemic originated out of the US BSL-4 facility in Sierra Leone, and [that] they were testing out a so-called vaccine that contained live Ebola and gave it to these poor people,\u201d Boyle says.\n\n\u201cAs for the CDC, it has been involved in every \u2026 BSL-4 biological warfare death science you could possibly imagine \u2026 It\u2019s a matter of public record that during the Reagan administration, the CDC and the American Type Culture Collection sent 40 shipments of weapons-grade biological warfare agents to Saddam Hussein in Iraq, in the hope and expectation that he would weaponize these agents and use them against Iran \u2026\n\nOf course, the problem is that when that war was over \u2026 an order was given to U.S. military forces to blow up Saddam Hussein\u2019s biological warfare facilities, and that\u2019s not how you deal with biological warfare weapons \u2026\n\n[It] contaminated our own troops, and that was a causative factor in the Gulf War Syndrome that \u2026 murdered about 11,000 U.S. troops and disabled about 100,000.\u201d\n\nAccording to Boyle, the U.S. government spent $100 billion on biological warfare programs since September 11, 2011, up until October 2015, which is no small sum. To put it into perspective, the U.S. spent $40 billion (assuming a constant dollar value) on the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb. Boyle also estimates the U.S. has some 13,000 life scientists working within the biowarfare industry.\n\n\u201cClearly, the Reagan administration, under the influence of its neoconservatives who definitely believe in biological weapons and ethnic-specific biological weapons (you can see that in the PNAC report), were engaged in the use of DNA genetic engineering for the purpose of manufacturing biological weapons.\n\nThat is why I gave a Congressional briefing in Washington, D.C. in 1985. I was asked to do that by the Council for Responsible Genetics that I work with, which involves the leading life scientists in the world from MIT and Harvard.\n\nI spent seven years at Harvard. I have three degrees and I knew all these people. They asked me to serve as their lawyer and give this Congressional briefing. I blew the whistle, and then they asked me to draft the implementing legislation, which I did \u2026\n\nI want to make it clear I\u2019m not here to speak in their name, I\u2019m only speaking in my name, but if you look at my book, \u2018Biological Warfare and Terrorism,\u2019 professor Jonathan King wrote the foreword. So, I have the leading MIT professor of molecular biology supporting what I\u2019m saying, if you don\u2019t think I know enough science about it.\u201d\n\nUS Prepares for COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nWhile there have so far only been a limited number of reported cases of COVID-19 infection in the U.S., the U.S. military has designated several detention sites around the country to quarantine Americans,8 should the situation take a turn for the worse.\n\nHistorically speaking, however, government health officials have been vastly exaggerating the threat of pandemics in the U.S., including the bird flu, the swine flu, anthrax and Ebola.\n\nFor example, as detailed in my 2009 New York Times bestseller \u201cThe Great Bird Flu Hoax,\u201d then-President George Bush Jr. projected 2 million Americans would die from bird flu; the best-case scenario taking only 200,000 lives. The final death count in the U.S. from that pandemic was zero.\n\nIt generated massive profits, though, as U.S. taxpayer dollars were used to purchase 20 million doses of Tamiflu. One of the people who was able to line his pockets from that hoax was defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who was president of Gilead Sciences when the drug was created.\n\n\u201c[The bird flu] was another DNA, genetically engineered biological warfare weapon,\u201d Boyle notes. \u201cIt was a chimera. It had three different elements in it and we were all lucky that somehow they attenuated the lethality and the infectiveness of the bird flu.\u201d\n\nWhether or not COVID-19 will be similarly ineffective in its spread and lethality remains to be seen. Judging by the statistics in China, \u201cit doesn\u2019t look very good,\u201d Boyle says.\n\nUnderstanding the COVID-19 Virus\n\nAccording to Boyle, the COVID-19 virus is a chimera, like the avian flu virus before it. It includes SARS, an already weaponized coronavirus, along with HIV genetic material. \u201cThat was in a published article by Indian scientists. You could see the pictures right there, [but] political pressure was brought to bear upon them so they withdrew [the paper].\u201d\n\nThis is why some scientists are now looking into using HIV drugs to treat it,9 Boyle says. COVID-19 may also have a flu virus mixed in, along with gain of function properties that allow it to spread a greater distance than normal.\n\nPandemics Repeatedly Used to Further Police State\n\nPandemics have also been used to chip away public freedoms. For example, the anthrax scare of 2001 was used as the impetus for signing the Patriot Act, which was the first step in taking away many of our personal freedoms and rolling out a complete surveillance state. To me, such outcomes are far more concerning than the risk of infection itself. Boyle adds:\n\n\u201cThey used Amerithrax to ram the Patriot Act through, that is correct \u2026 We became a police state \u2026 And as I pointed out in \u2018Biowarfare and Terrorism,\u2019 I think the same people who were behind the 9/11 terrorist attack were also behind the Amerithrax, but I\u2019m just connecting dots there \u2026\n\nWhat\u2019s called Amerithrax came out of a U.S. government biological warfare weapons lab and program, and I publicly blew the whistle on that the first weekend of November 2001.\n\nThe Council for Responsible Genetics was having its convention at Harvard Business School and I was chairing a panel with King and other experts on biological warfare, on U.S. biological warfare programs.\n\nAs I was walking into the Harvard Divinity School, Fox TV had a camera crew there and I said, \u2018Obviously, this came out a U.S. biological weapons program and probably Fort Detrick.\u2019\n\nI conducted the session and made the same comment. Then I made a comment to a Washington, D.C., radio station to that effect [and to] the BBC, so everyone in the world heard me.\n\nAt that point, someone gave an order that I was never to be interviewed again by any mainstream news about biological warfare programs. And that\u2019s been the case since the first week of November 2001.\u201d\n\nAs noted by Boyle, George Orwell\u2019s book, \u201c1984,\u201d has become reality. Boyle has since lectured lawyers at DePaul Law School in Chicago about the totalitarian nature of the Patriot Act.\n\n\u201cSnowden has correctly pointed out the federal government is spying on everything we say, all of our electronic communications, you name it,\u201d Boyle says.\n\n\u201cAnd again, the proof is I\u2019ve been completely blackballed out of U.S. media. Indeed, if you go back and look at the Amerithrax attacks, they also hit mainstream U.S. media to make it clear to them that if they covered this issue they will be killed too.\u201d\n\nBioweapons Are Developed To Be Used\n\nAs noted by Boyle, the U.S. government has a large stockpile of Amerithrax \u2014 a super weapons-grade nanotechnology anthrax with 1 trillion spores per gram \u2014 and that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg of the biological weapons developed. What\u2019s more, Boyle has no doubt these weapons will eventually be put to use, as they have in the past. He says:\n\n\u201cThere was a tabletop exercise at John Hopkins University last fall \u2026 on coronavirus.10Tabletop exercise, that\u2019s a euphemism for a war game. Their estimate was that it killed 65 million people11 \u2026\n\nJohn Hopkins is up to their eyeballs in this Nazi biological warfare dirty work. They have a BSL-3 facility there \u2026 that they proudly announce on their website \u2026 They justify it by saying they\u2019re developing vaccines. OK \u2026 How do they do that?\n\nThey go out around the world, and this is a matter of public record, and scour for every type of hideous disease, fungus, virus and bacteria you can possibly imagine. They then bring it back to these BSL-4 labs and develop an offensive, biological agent using DNA genetic engineering and synthetic biology \u2026 set up by the Pentagon under DARPA \u2026\n\nOnce they have this offensive agent, they then proceed to develop a vaccine, because the agent is no good unless you can have a vaccine to protect your own people.\n\nSo, they\u2019re developing vaccines to have biological weapons, because a biological weapon consists of two elements: the offensive biological warfare agent in the first place, and then, second, a vaccine to protect your own people, and that is what is being done at all these BSL-4 facilities, and many of the BSL-3s as well.\n\nJohn Hopkins has a BSL-3 and they admit they do dual use. That\u2019s what dual use means. They first develop the offensive biological warfare agent and then they develop the supposed vaccine.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Johns Hopkins University is the biggest recipient of research grants from federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation and Department of Defense. It has also received millions of dollars in research grants from the Gates Foundation.12 In 2016, Johns Hopkins spent more than $2 billion on research projects, leading all U.S. universities in research spending for the 38th year in a row.13\n\nHow Can We Best Prevent or Treat COVID-19 Infection?\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear exactly which treatment is the most effective, my guess is that Dr. Paul Marik\u2019s intravenous vitamin C protocol for sepsis would be a good starting point, seeing how sepsis appears to be what kills those who succumb to a serious COVID-19 infection.\n\nMarik\u2019s retrospective before-after clinical study14,15 showed that giving patients IV vitamin C with hydrocortisone and vitamin B1 for two days reduced mortality from 40% to 8.5%. The precise protocol used was 200 mg of thiamine every 12 hours, 1,500 mg of ascorbic acid every six hours, and 50 mg of hydrocortisone every six hours.16 Importantly, the treatment has no side effects and is inexpensive, readily available and simple to administer.\n\nAccording to Marik, vitamin C and corticosteroids have a synergistic effect,17 which is part of why his combo protocol is so effective. Still, simply using high-dose IV vitamin C exclusively has been shown to improve survival in patients with sepsis and acute respiratory failure, reducing mortality from 46% to 30%.18\n\nIt also reduced the number of days they needed to remain hospitalized. On average, those who received vitamin C had by Day 28 spent three fewer days in the intensive care unit than the placebo group (seven days compared to 10). By Day 60, the treatment group had also spent seven fewer days in the hospital overall \u201415 days compared to 22.19\n\nWhile there are no trials that look at integrating hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), my suspicion is that this would provide a powerful synergy that could get the fatality rate from sepsis even closer to zero. Sadly, HBOT is not available at many hospitals, and even if it were, it is not approved for sepsis.\n\nYou can learn more about Marik\u2019s sepsis protocol in \u201cVitamin C \u2014 A Game Changer in Treatment of Deadly Sepsis,\u201d along with commonsense recommendations for how to lower your risk of sepsis in the first place.\n\nYou can also review Marik\u2019s PowerPoint presentation, \u201cHydrocortisone, Ascorbic Acid and Thiamine for the Treatment of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock,\u201d presented at the 2020 Critical Care Reviews meeting in Australia.

        "As millions of people in China emerge from weeks of lockdown, their freedom of movement is largely dependent on phone apps. Apps, which allow people to move around after lockdown, have become an integral part of Chinese authorities\u2019 management of citizens\n\nThe \u201chealth code\u201d service \u2013 run on the ubiquitous platforms Alipay and WeChat and developed for the Chinese government \u2013 give users colour-coded designations based on their health status and travel history, and a QR code that can be scanned by authorities.\n\nThe apps are specific to each city or province, but generally people given a green code are allowed to travel relatively freely. A yellow code indicates that the holder should be in home isolation, and a red code says the user is a confirmed Covid-19 patient and should be in quarantine.\n\nThe apps have become an integral part of Chinese authorities\u2019 management of people and their movements in and out of affected areas. When lockdown restrictions in Hubei province were lifted last week, the government allowed residents with a green code to travel within and out of the province.\n\nSome restaurants, shops, hotels and other establishments ask for patrons to show their codes before entering. In Wuhan, only those with a green health code are allowed to take public transport.\n\nHowever, the technology has raised concerns about their reach into people\u2019s private lives and data.\n\nThere have been complaints by Chinese social media users about a lack of transparency over how the app works and what data it is storing. Some have reported being unable to change erroneous \u201cred\u201d designations, and questioned the reliance on internet connection and surveillance.\n\n\u201cWhy should you let companies such as Alipay and WeChat monitor and trace you with the health code?\u201d said one user.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t it be integrated into the chip of our ID card? And some people\u2019s mobile phones are not connected to the internet. I don\u2019t know what leaders are thinking?\u201d\n\nThe apps rely on a combination of self-reporting by the user and government information, including a person\u2019s medical records, their travel history and if they have been in contact with someone diagnosed with Covid-19.\n\nAccording to screenshots of an English-language version of the Alipay app, applicants are asked for contact and passport details and recent travel, and for relevant medical certification. Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba that operates Alipay, said that it does not provide or operate the service and has no access to the data entered into it. The company said it provided technical support to the Hangzhou city government when it was developing its version of the software.\n\nOfficial guidelines for the WeChat app say it takes basic identity and address details as well as \u201cthe history of close contact with suspected patients, history of travel and residence outside the resident\u201d.\n\nIt draws on medical information including \u201csymptoms (such as fever, cough), medical treatment, isolated observation, contact information, travel history of the epidemic area\u201d, and the user\u2019s travel history including the mode of travel and what seat they sat in, and details on the vehicle and its driver.\n\nThe health code app, launched in Hangzhou in early February, and described by state media as \u201cAlipay Health code\u201d spread to more than 100 cities within a week before it was rolled out nationally.\n\nSource: The Guardian\n\nFollow us\n\nShare this article",

        "Scientists keep reminding people that pathogens can become trapped on face masks and that the masks should be sterilized between use. So one popular question that has come up lately is, \u2018can ultraviolet (UV) light do the job?\u2019\n\nWe\u2019ve seen UV\u2019s powerful benefits before. Cutting-edge technology has been used to sterilize hospitals in state-of-the-art facilities for years. This technique even made headlines when Ebola was scaring the world.\n\nFrom LA Times:\n\nIdeally, single-use face masks should be worn once and then thrown away, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That\u2019s certainly true of the top-of-the-line N95 masks used by healthcare workers that are designed to filter out 95% of tiny particles when properly fitted to a wearer\u2019s face.\n\nBut last week, the CDC released new guidance on decontamination methods for emergency situations, such as the one healthcare workers are facing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Any disinfection process would need to kill the coronavirus without harming an N95 mask\u2019s ability to filter particles or fit snugly to the skin.\n\nUltraviolet germicidal radiation is one of the methods presented by the CDC, and UV light has generated great interest from the public. It\u2019s already used in hospitals to disinfect contaminated surfaces. And there\u2019s a fairly robust market of devices aimed at consumers, such as disinfectants for sleep apnea machines (although no such devices have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration so far). Other products purport to clean cellphones and disinfect water bottles.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at what ultraviolet light is and why it could be a useful tool in combating the coronavirus in certain situations.\n\nWhat is UV light?\n\nUltraviolet light, also known as UV light, is invisible to humans. Though it\u2019s adjacent to visible light on the electromagnetic spectrum, its wavelengths are just too short for our eyes to register and see.\n\nUV rays are also high-energy, so while we can\u2019t see them, we certainly feel their effects. For instance, ultraviolet light generated by the sun is what gives you a tan \u2014 or a sunburn. It can also lead to skin cancer.\n\nUltraviolet light falls into three categories, according to the World Health Organization:\n\n\u2022 UVA: This is the lowest-energy form of UV, and it accounts for about 95% of the ultraviolet light that reaches the Earth from the sun. It can penetrate deep into the skin\u2019s layers, which makes it responsible for the early tanning effect. It also contributes to skin aging, wrinkling and possibly skin cancer.\n\n\u2022 UVB: This higher-energy type of ultraviolet light can permeate the skin\u2019s superficial layers. It\u2019s responsible for delayed tanning (and burning), and is a big contributor to skin cancer and aging. Most of the UVB that comes our way is absorbed by the Earth\u2019s ozone layer, so it only makes up about 5% of the solar UV that reaches Earth.\n\n\u2022 UVC: The highest-energy category of ultraviolet light \u2014 any higher and you\u2019d be in X-ray territory \u2014 is also the most damaging. Luckily, the ozone layer and atmosphere completely absorb it.\n\nThe UV light used in medical disinfection devices is a particular wavelength of UVC.\n\nHow does UV disinfect stuff?\n\nUltraviolet light can penetrate the cells of pathogens and damage the DNA or RNA that contain their genetic code, said Jim Malley, an environmental engineer at the University of New Hampshire.\n\nThere\u2019s also some evidence that UV can damage the amino acids and proteins that either protect the virus or allow it to attach to and infect a host cell.\n\nSo it\u2019s already in use?\n\nYes. People have been disinfecting things with UV for more than a century, according to Ron Hofmann, an environmental engineer at the University of Toronto.\n\nMany experts say the first full-scale UV disinfection system for water treatment was used in Marseilles, France, in 1910, Malley said.\n\nModern UV devices come in a range of shapes and sizes. Some are not much bigger than cellphones. Others can be as large as a Cadillac Escalade \u2014 or multiple Escalades parked nose to bumper, in the case of the systems used to disinfect drinking water in Los Angeles and New York, Malley said.\n\nMany midsize UV machines \u2014 about the size of a large garbage bin \u2014 are used in hospitals to disinfect patients\u2019 rooms after they\u2019ve left.\n\nMore from new.yahoo.com\n\nFollow us\n\nShare this article",

        "United States hospitals have observed some new symptoms that are not included in the list made available by the CDC. Scientists continue to learn more about the virus as it spreads. There are now over 100,000 reported cases in the U.S. with 1715 deaths.\n\nAccording to Chinese data, cases of infection in the US surpassed China where the outbreak originated. China says it only has 81,394 infections as of today 3/28/20. Some have questioned whether or not the Chinese government is being honest about their coronavirus data. Indeed, the Communist Party of China has a history of lying about and covering-up issues they believe paint them in a negative light.\n\nAlthough the sudden jump in active cases in the U.S. might alarm Americans. This sudden jump in positive cases has a lot to do with the rollout of coronavirus tests. Furthermore this gives scientists an opportunity to look at the virus in more subjects and learn a great deal about how to beat it.\n\nExperts say that the proliferation of coronavirus cases in the United States has provided them with new insight regarding how the disease can affect certain populations.\n\nFrom International Business Times:\n\nA New Symptom\n\nThe throng of patients being admitted to U.S. hospitals has alerted medical personnel to a new symptom. People going to hospitals have complained of feeling stomach pain, a symptom that has not been included in the list of coronavirus symptoms.\n\nMichael Hirsh, the director of public health in Worcester, Massachusetts, said that hospitals are now admitting patients who tested positive for coronavirus having only abdominal pain as their symptom. Dr. Hirsh said that what they are seeing are patients coming in no so much having respiratory complaints but with abdominal pains.\n\nStomach Pain And Pneumonia\n\nAccording to Dr. Hirsch, the pain they feel in their tummy is caused by the development of pneumonia located in the lower lobes of the patients\u2019 lungs. If these lobes are frequently inflamed, the irritation in their diaphragm can cause pain in their abdominal area.\n\nDr. Hirsch, who is also a general surgeon, said that the more they see the disease, the better they learn about it. He said that as time goes by, scientists are going to see some manifestations of the disease that did not fit that classic symptom of fever and dry hacking cough.\n\nNo Respiratory Symptoms\n\nThe general surgeon revealed that many of the COVID-19 patients suffering from abdominal pain did not have any respiratory symptoms. Although at the moment, there is inadequate data they can use to map out trustworthy patterns, it appears that it is the younger patients who report stomach pain.

        "By Catherine Yang, The Epoch Times\n\nWhile The Epoch Times began publishing reports of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus on Jan. 2, most outlets had yet to pick up on the story because of the CCP\u2019s lockdown on information. Three months later, over 200 countries and territories have been infected and the CCP virus has caused over 85,000 deaths infecting at least 1.4 million, but information is murkier than ever.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve pretty much heard every rumor under the sun. We\u2019ve heard every theory, every crazy rumor, we\u2019ve heard all these different narratives,\u201d said Joshua Philipp, award-winning investigative reporter and host of the show \u201cCrossroads.\u201d\n\nThe rumors aren\u2019t by accident: The CCP has been actively engaging in a disinformation campaign, and media outlets around the world have parroted the propaganda. As a result, entire nations have been operating under false information as they try to battle the pandemic within their borders.\n\nScreenshot of the documentary \u201cTracking Down the Origin of Wuhan Coronavirus.\u201d (Courtesy Epoch Times)\n\nPhilipp and his colleages at The Epoch Times and NTD Television thought it their responsibility to sift through all the information available, verify it, and put it into one place. The result is the just-premiered documentary \u201cTracking Down the Origin of the Wuhan Coronavirus,\u201d which is available to watch online. Less than two days after its premiere, the documentary has around 1.6 million views across different platforms.\n\nThe film \u201creally tries to sift through all of the rumors, all of the truths, all of the falsehoods, and show people as accurate a picture as possible of what really happened and where this virus actually came from,\u201d Philipp said.\n\nIn it, Philipp pieces together the development of the virus and includes interviews that shed light on the Chinese regime\u2019s actions and intentions.\n\nLives at Stake\n\nIt should be very telling that the nine-person panel the CCP created to address the pandemic, once it finally acknowledged the virus in January, is filled with propaganda officials, said China affairs columnist Gordon Chang in the documentary.\n\nMany countries have accepted or bought faulty equipment from China, for example, and \u201cthey\u2019re getting duped,\u201dPhilipp said.\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, this is because they don\u2019t understand the Chinese Communist Party, they don\u2019t understand how [the CCP] works, and, even as we speak right now, the Chinese Communist Party is claiming it\u2019s over in China when it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nChina affairs columnist Gordon Chang. (Courtesy of Epoch Times)\n\n\u201cAnd what that means is, as they open things up and reopen flights, there\u2019s a major risk to other countries,\u201d Philipp said. \u201cIf [these countries] don\u2019t have accurate information, then what can they base their information on?\u201d\n\nAs the documentary shows, the CCP\u2019s delay in sharing information about the virus with other countries was not mere oversight. And beyond covering up the epidemic, China\u2019s current actions and disinformation continues to endanger lives around the globe. The CCP has gone from denying the existence of the virus to spreading as many lies as it can to obscure the truth.\n\n\u201cThis is an issue of human life,\u201d Philipp said.\n\nWhy Would the CCP Lie?\n\nFrom the beginning, the CCP has not been forthcoming.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s there, but the fact that the Communist Party is covering this up should trouble us deeply,\u201d Chang said.\n\nThose unfamiliar with the CCP will likely be shocked to discover the regime\u2019s motives.\n\nPhilipp\u2019s investigation of the CCP virus in this documentary goes back to the outbreak of SARS nearly two decades ago. The CCP tried to cover up the SARS outbreak as well, and The Epoch Times was one of the few media to expose this. There is precedent of the regime being untrustworthy in the event of an epidemic.\n\nPhilipp has been researching the CCP since 2008, and gave an example of its military approach to shed light on how the CCP can profit off this pandemic most consider a tragedy.\n\n\u201cOne important thing to understand is they talk about war without morals. They talk about \u2018unrestricted warfare\u2019: war that does not take into account any concept of human rights, human dignity, human life. It is victory by any means. There is nothing they will not do, and we see the same thing in many parts of their system, including the medical system where altering the human genome is not a big deal to them,\u201dPhilipp said.\n\nThe documentary\u2019s experts remind us: this is a nation that currently holds at least 1 million of its own people in concentration camps.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t care about human life when it comes to this regime\u2014we\u2019ve seen that in their human rights abuses,\u201d Philipp said.\n\nEpoch Times investigative journalist Joshua Philipp. (Courtesy of Epoch Times)\n\nThe documentary shows another link to SARS, and how one of China\u2019s top virus experts\u2019 study of SARS at the Wuhan Institute of Virology led to breakthroughs in creating a coronavirus to infect humans. But to what end?\n\n\u201cThe Chinese Communist Party has been very open about its biological warfare ambitions, they don\u2019t even try to hide it. And it\u2019s been a huge injustice that people have not held them to stronger account than they should have, because the Chinese Communist Party is able to act with impunity and nobody criticizes what they do,\u201d Philipp said.\n\nThe documentary is a comprehensive look at what the virus is and what has happened, and Philipp hopes it can allow nations to make better-informed decisions.\n\nDr. Sean Lin, former lab director of the viral disease branch at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. (Courtesy of Epoch Times)\n\n\u201cAt the very least, we can provide this as a package of information that will inform the entire world exactly where this virus came from, and exactly what needs to be done going forward,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd at the very least, they will be more cautious when dealing with the Chinese Communist Party, especially at this time.\u201d \u201cPeople\u2019s lives are at stake and we find it very necessary to do this kind of work,\u201d he said.\n\nTalking Points\n\nThe information is perhaps more vital than ever, because while countries are turning to the World Health Organization for information, WHO is turning to the CCP.\n\nGeneral Robert Spalding, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and former National Security Council senior strategy director, was in China when SARS broke out; he was evacuated, but he knows what a cover-up looks like. How the CCP handled the SARS cover-up is exactly how they have handled this one. He is among several experts who say the CCP clearly has no intention of ending the epidemic or curing the virus.\n\nSenior investigative Epoch Times reporter Joshua Philipp in New York City. (Courtesy of Epoch Times)\n\n\u201cYou can see that the WHO is essentially following the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s guidelines,\u201d Spalding said.\n\nThe WHO isn\u2019t the only organization doing so; international organizations to individual academic institutions around the world are afraid to say something that may anger the CCP. In recent weeks, Philipp had reached out many well-known scientists who once suggested the virus causing this mysterious COVID-19 disease was created in a lab, but they no longer wanted to talk.\n\nFrom the beginning, the CCP prevented organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from studying the origin of COVID-19, Gordon Chang said.\n\nThe CCP\u2019s actions speak to a problem deeper than the virus.\n\n\u201cEvery country has diseases, but in China they become national emergencies and global emergencies, because the real disease here is communism,\u201d Chang said.\n\nWatch the complete documentary below:\n\nSource: The Epoch Times\n\nFollow us\n\nShare this article",

        "Experts have repeatedly told us that the best way to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus is to avoid physical distance with sick people. But that\u2019s pretty difficult to achieve in modern society, where more than half the world\u2019s population lives in urban areas, using public transport, eating in the same restaurants, drinking together in pubs, and interacting in a myriad other ways every single day.\n\nSince the COVID-19 virus is so incredibly contagious, public areas frequented by large groups of people, as well as hospital rooms that have been used by sick patients, need to be carefully disinfected.\n\nRobots that can disinfect these areas by utilizing the power of the sun\u2019s ultraviolet rays are the latest weapon in the fight against the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nWhy ultraviolet light is the right weapon against COVID-19\n\nThe sun is an incredibly powerful natural disinfectant; its ultraviolet rays are strong enough to kill most harmful bacteria on exposed skin or clothing by destroying the nucleic acids in bacteria and other types of microbes.\n\nAs reported by The Epoch Times, concentrated UVC light has already been used for over five decades as an effective disinfectant in the manufacture of many different beverages, as well as for disinfecting fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, frozen foods and baked goods.\n\nNow, robots using this same type of light are being used to safely disinfect hospital rooms that have housed COVID-19 patients, as well as other public areas.\n\nAs reported by the BBC, though this technology has been available for some time, the coronavirus has \u201crocketed\u201d demand for these special robots.\n\nAn employee disinfects a Johannesburg, South Africa, hospital with a robot that emits ultraviolet light. (AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to Sam Ellison, vice president of UVD Robots, \u201ctruckloads\u201d of these robots have already been shipped to China, and more recently demand has escalated in other parts of the world.\n\nThe BBC reported:\n\nProduction has been accelerated and it now takes less than a day to make one robot at their facility in Odense, Denmark\u2019s third largest city and home to a growing robotics hub.\n\nGlowing like light sabres, eight bulbs emit concentrated UV-C ultraviolet light. This destroys bacteria, viruses and other harmful microbes by damaging their DNA and RNA, so they can\u2019t multiply. \u2026\n\nThe job is done in 10-20 minutes. Afterwards there\u2019s a smell, much like burned hair.\n\nAs explained by The Epoch Times, Klaran, another firm that specializes in UVC LED products, has developed a robot that uses wavelengths between 200 and 280 nanometers (UVC) to effectively disinfect against pathogens.\n\nAnd Dimer UVC Innovation, based in Los Angeles, has developed a robot that can disinfect up to 10 hospital rooms in a single hour.\n\nThe Epoch Times reported:\n\nDimer just announced that it will offer GermFalcon robots designed to autonomously navigate through airplane cabins and passenger terminal waiting areas to strategically \u2018kill viruses, bacteria, and superbugs\u2019 on high-touch surfaces.\n\nCo-founder Elliot Kreitenberg stated the Dimer germ-killing system will participate in the coronavirus emergency response efforts at the Los Angeles International Airport, San Francisco International Airport, and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.\n\nProf Hans J\u00f8rn Kolmos, a professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Southern Denmark, explains that many different organisms can cause infections, but that the correct dose of ultraviolet light, applied for an appropriate length of time, will kill most of them.\n\nHe added, \u201cThis type of disinfection can also be applied to epidemic situations, like the one we experience right now, with coronavirus disease.\u201d\n\nSources:\n\nTheepochtimes.com\n\nBBC.com\n\nCredit: Naturalnews.com\n\nImage: Flickr/NIAID\n\nFollow us\n\nShare this article",

        "As millions of people in China emerge from weeks of lockdown, their freedom of movement is largely dependent on phone apps. Apps, which allow people to move around after lockdown, have become an integral part of Chinese authorities\u2019 management of citizens\n\nThe \u201chealth code\u201d service \u2013 run on the ubiquitous platforms Alipay and WeChat and developed for the Chinese government \u2013 give users colour-coded designations based on their health status and travel history, and a QR code that can be scanned by authorities.\n\nThe apps are specific to each city or province, but generally people given a green code are allowed to travel relatively freely. A yellow code indicates that the holder should be in home isolation, and a red code says the user is a confirmed Covid-19 patient and should be in quarantine.\n\nThe apps have become an integral part of Chinese authorities\u2019 management of people and their movements in and out of affected areas. When lockdown restrictions in Hubei province were lifted last week, the government allowed residents with a green code to travel within and out of the province.\n\nSome restaurants, shops, hotels and other establishments ask for patrons to show their codes before entering. In Wuhan, only those with a green health code are allowed to take public transport.\n\nHowever, the technology has raised concerns about their reach into people\u2019s private lives and data.\n\nThere have been complaints by Chinese social media users about a lack of transparency over how the app works and what data it is storing. Some have reported being unable to change erroneous \u201cred\u201d designations, and questioned the reliance on internet connection and surveillance.\n\n\u201cWhy should you let companies such as Alipay and WeChat monitor and trace you with the health code?\u201d said one user.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t it be integrated into the chip of our ID card? And some people\u2019s mobile phones are not connected to the internet. I don\u2019t know what leaders are thinking?\u201d\n\nThe apps rely on a combination of self-reporting by the user and government information, including a person\u2019s medical records, their travel history and if they have been in contact with someone diagnosed with Covid-19.\n\nAccording to screenshots of an English-language version of the Alipay app, applicants are asked for contact and passport details and recent travel, and for relevant medical certification. Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba that operates Alipay, said that it does not provide or operate the service and has no access to the data entered into it. The company said it provided technical support to the Hangzhou city government when it was developing its version of the software.\n\nOfficial guidelines for the WeChat app say it takes basic identity and address details as well as \u201cthe history of close contact with suspected patients, history of travel and residence outside the resident\u201d.\n\nIt draws on medical information including \u201csymptoms (such as fever, cough), medical treatment, isolated observation, contact information, travel history of the epidemic area\u201d, and the user\u2019s travel history including the mode of travel and what seat they sat in, and details on the vehicle and its driver.\n\nThe health code app, launched in Hangzhou in early February, and described by state media as \u201cAlipay Health code\u201d spread to more than 100 cities within a week before it was rolled out nationally.\n\nSource: The Guardian\n\nFollow us\n\nShare this article",
        "Opinion | America\u2019s Frontline Doctors\u2019 founder Simone Gold was sentenced to serve 60 days in prison and ordered to pay a $9,500 fine for her involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021 event. U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper in Washington, DC also sentenced Dr. Simone Gold to 12 months of supervised release after her 60-day prison term is served.\n\nThe following is a statement released by America\u2019s Frontline Doctors prior to the sentencing on June 16, 2022.\n\nSix months after America\u2019s Frontline Doctors\u2019 viral video of their press conference on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court on July 27, 2020, Founder Dr. Simone Gold traveled to a free speech rally in Washington, DC, to speak on January 6, 2021.\n\nIn the months between the press conference and January 6th, Dr. Gold was asked to present publicly on numerous occasions about physicians\u2019 free speech and her experience of being fired for prescribing early treatment to COVID-19 patients.\n\nBy this time, she had also founded America\u2019s Frontline Doctors, a division of the Free Speech Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization. Dr. Gold was scheduled to speak on January 6th alongside numerous other presenters after President Trump\u2019s appearance at the rally, which had a government approved permit.\n\nAt her expected start time, Dr. Gold was then told all speeches were suddenly canceled without explanation. Upon hearing this, Dr. Gold was amongst thousands swept into the Capitol building when the doors were opened from the inside, with law enforcement officers ushering people in. While there, Dr. Gold realized it was the only remaining moment to deliver her message to those who came to hear it, and so she gave her remarks there.\n\nWhen an officer instructed her to move towards an exit, she complied, and shortly after when asked to leave the building entirely, she did so. The media coverage after January 6th showed carefully selected edits of violent scenes, but that was not Dr. Gold\u2019s observation of the day.\n\nSubsequently, Dr. Gold was arrested and prosecuted along with hundreds of other non-violent citizens for being present at the Capitol. Dr. Gold reached a plea agreement for entering a restricted building. Her sentencing is scheduled today, June 16, 2022.\n\nDr. Gold did express regret for being involved in a situation that later became unpredictable, but what she is facing are the consequences of exercising free speech in today\u2019s America. Like most January 6th defendants, she is a victim of selective prosecution\u2014a defining feature of corrupted governments, and a direct violation of the equal protection guarantee of the US Constitution.\n\nFor example, consider that there were hundreds of arrests for violent protests in association with President Trump\u2019s Inauguration in 2017. The government subsequently dropped all of those charges, including charges against people who were actually disrupting Congress from inside the Congressional gallery while Congress was in session. But with the January 6th arrests, the government has not only failed to drop any charges against nonviolent persons in public spaces, such as Dr. Gold, it has instead aggressively violated defendants\u2019 civil rights at nearly every turn.\n\nThere are innumerable well-documented instances of January 6th defendants not receiving due process noted in the book January 6 authored by Julie Kelly. For instance, some defendants have been held in prison for nearly 18 months pretrial.\n\nIn Dr. Gold\u2019s case, she peacefully gave a speech on medical freedom and Constitutional rights in the public Rotunda. This resulted in the government violently arresting her in a surprise raid, breaking the front door of her home, using over a dozen FBI and law enforcement officers with assault weapons pointed at her from two feet away. The intent to terrorize her with this tactical assault suited to a raid on a violent drug cartel was unmistakable; she suffers from PTSD to this day.\n\nDr. Gold\u2019s peaceful exercise of her 1st Amendment rights also resulted in numerous restrictions of her personal civil liberties and severe interference with her ability to serve the millions who look to America\u2019s Frontline Doctors for life- saving information and civil rights support.

The only person who was killed, Ashli Babbitt, a petite unarmed 35-year-old female military veteran posing no lethal danger, was gunned down by Michael Byrd, a Capitol police officer, who in a prior incident of severe negligence left a loaded gun with no safety in a public restroom.

        "Jacob Puliyel, MD, a pediatrician in India for more than 40 years, brought suit in the Supreme Court of India against the Union of India and COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers in a legal challenge to the country\u2019s COVID vaccine program.1 Dr. Puliyel, who has served as Director of Research and Projects at Holy Family Hospital in Delhi and is a former member of the National Technical Advisory Group (NTAG) on immunizations in India, sued the government and COVID vaccine manufacturers seeking release of information related to the COVID vaccine approval process, as well as arguing for a policy change that allows unvaccinated persons to enter public spaces and access resources.\n\nSpecifically, Dr. Puliyel asked the Supreme Court of India for the release of each phase of clinical trial data for the COVID vaccines administered in India; disclosure of minutes from the meeting of the Subject Expert Committee and the NTGAI with regard to vaccines; release of information surrounding the approval or rejection of emergency use applications of vaccines by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI); and disclosure of post vaccination data related to COVID. He also asked the court to declare that all COVID vaccine mandates are unconstitutional and a violation of h2citizen\u2019s rights.\n\nDr. Puliyel: COVID Vaccines Do Not Prevent Infection or Transmission\n\nIn support of his request, Dr. Puliyel submitted affidavits to the court stating that natural immunity from SARS-CoV-2 is superior to vaccine acquired immunity and that vaccines do not prevent infection or transmission of COVID. News articles were submitted to show that two-thirds of the population in India had already been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have antibodies to the virus, and that the vaccinated were susceptible to breakthrough infections. Dr. Puliyel also argued that vaccine mandates and restrictions on the unvaccinated are meaningless because the virus is transmitted by the vaccinated and unvaccinated alike.\n\nThe government maintained that the COVID vaccines administered in India, Covaxin and Covishield, are needed to combat the global pandemic threat. They also maintained that trial data cannot be released to the public due to privacy concerns; that information regarding adverse events has already been released; that vaccination remains voluntary for all citizens, and that restrictions on the unvaccinated were necessary to protect the public health.\n\nRespondent COVID vaccine manufacturers argued that they followed strict guidelines for government approval of their COVID vaccines.\n\nThe Union of India strongly opposed this lawsuit, claiming that the publicity could increase vaccine hesitancy and endanger the public health, and that public health matters should not be interfered with by the court. However, because Dr. Puliyel brought this lawsuit in the interest of the public and because he is considered a subject matter expert, the Court determined the case would be heard for the welfare of the public.\n\nThe Supreme Court of India Looked to High Courts in Other Countries\n\nThe government made their argument relying on prominent cases in India, as well as U.S. cases, such as Jacobson v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Zucht v. King; Biden vs. Missouri, and Roman Catholic Diocese v. Cuomo. The court also looked to New South Wales for guidance, finding that the Supreme Court in Assam v. Hazzard held that it was not the court\u2019s role to determine the effectiveness of the government\u2019s regulations or whether the regulations were the best response to the risks COVID posed to the public, instead the New South Whales Supreme Court emphasized that their only role was to determine the legal validity of the Minister\u2019s orders.\n\nReviewing India\u2019s case history, the Court summarized its role in reviewing policy decisions:\n\nto check whether it violates the fundamental rights of the citizens or is opposed to the provisions of the Constitution, or opposed to any statutory provision or manifestly arbitrary\u201d but not to, \u201csubstitute their own views as to what is wise, safe, prudent or proper. 2 In Distribution of Essential Supplies & Services during Pandemic, the Court determined that it would not, \u201csecond guess\u201d the policy experts, but would \u201cexercise jurisdiction to determine if the chosen policy measure conforms to the standards of reasonableness, militates against manifest arbitrariness and protects the right to life of all persons.\u201d3\n\nCourt Found Forced Vaccination Violates the Constitution of India\n\nIn considering the global pandemic, the court said that it could not find fault with the government\u2019s vaccination drive, citing the highly transmissible Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2; the approximate loss of 5,23,843 lives from the virus in India; and the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), TAG-CO-VAC and SAGE that vaccination would provide strong protection against serious illness, hospitalization and death.\n\nHowever, regarding the issue of the right of individual privacy verses the government restricting individual rights in the name of public health, the Supreme Court of India found that forced vaccination is a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The Court previously found in Article 21 a right to personal autonomy, which extends to the right to refuse medical treatment.\n\nIn balancing the state\u2019s interest in public health and an individual\u2019s right to personal autonomy, the court found that Article 21 of the Indian Constitution grants individuals the right to determine how they should live their own life, which includes the right to refuse medical treatment such as vaccination. However, when there is a likelihood that an individual could spread the virus to other people, the state\u2019s interest in protecting the public allows the government to impose certain restrictions on individual rights, as long as such restrictions are reasonable, in proportion to the objective sought, and reviewable by the courts. Accordingly, the Court found that the government\u2019s restrictions are a valid exercise of power, despite evidence that an unvaccinated person is no more likely to spread the Delta or Omicron variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus than a vaccinated person.\n\nThe Court: COVID Vaccination Policy in India Not Unreasonable\n\nIn support of his case, Dr. Puliyel presented scientific journals showing that patients who recovered from COVID still had antibodies 11 months after infection. He also pointed out that countries with a higher percent of the population vaccinated have a higher rate of COVID per one million people. He said that a vaccine surveillance report in the United Kingdom showed that, in week 40, there was a negative efficacy of the vaccine in those over the age of 30.\n\nThe court confirmed that its only role is to determine whether the Union of India took into consideration scientific research when establishing its policy advocating COVID vaccination for the entire country. The court acknowledged that large portions of the public cannot be considered healthy because they suffer from chronic disease and lack of nutrition, especially the elderly population, and that the Union of India\u2019s vaccination policy was rightly centered around large segments of more vulnerable people, rather than a minority who are healthy as the subjects in the scientific articles that Dr. Puliyel presented to support the efficacy of natural immunity. Accordingly, the court found that the COVID vaccination policy of India was made in the interest of public health and is not unreasonable.\n\nThe Court: Vaccinated Population a Source of Virus Transmission\n\nConsidering the fact that the vaccinated and the unvaccinated pose nearly the same risk of transmitting the virus, the court looked at whether the Union of India\u2019s vaccination policy of restricting unvaccinated persons from accessing public resources amounted to discrimination. Dr. Puliyel presented a letter published in the Lancet finding that peak viral load of COVID did not differ either by vaccination status or by variant; that the secondary infection rate of vaccinated and unvaccinated households only differed by two percent, and that four of the five most vaccinated countries were categorized by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as high transmission countries. In addition, he submitted a study conducted in Massachusetts in July 2021 demonstrating that, after attending public gatherings, 346 out of 469 COVID cases (74 percent) were among vaccinated persons.\n\nPresented with this data, the court concluded:\n\nIt appears to be grossly negligent to ignore the vaccinated population as a possible and relevant source of transmission when deciding about public health control measures.4 The court admitted that vaccine mandates may have been found to be constitutional prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that do not appear to respond to COVID vaccines. However, now that vaccinated persons present nearly the same risk of transmission as unvaccinated persons, the court said that restrictions placed on the unvaccinated are not in proportion to the risk they pose to public health.4\n\nThe court wrote:\n\nWhile there is abundant data to show that getting vaccinated continues to be the dominant expert advice even in the face of new variants, no submission nor any data has been put forth to justify restrictions only on unvaccinated individuals when emerging scientific evidence appears to indicate that the risk of transmission of the virus from unvaccinated individuals is almost on par with that from vaccinated persons. To put it differently, neither the Union of India nor the State Governments have produced any material before this court to justify the discriminatory treatment of unvaccinated individuals in public places by imposition of vaccine mandates\u201d5\n\nThe court suggested that all authorities, public, private and educational, review their current orders that restrict an unvaccinated person\u2019s access to public services and resources.\n\nThe Court: Government Followed Approval Process for COVID Vaccines\n\nDr. Puliyel asserted that the government rushed the approval of COVID vaccines in, \u201ca hurried and opaque manner.\u201d6 He said that the trial data, regulatory approvals, and minutes from meetings approving the vaccine have not been publicly disclosed, which demonstrates a lack of transparency in the approval process, and that, while the complete data sets may not be available yet, releasing preliminary COVID vaccine adverse event data would allow individuals to make an informed vaccination decision.\n\nThe court disagreed, finding that the government\u2019s approval for emergency use of the COVID-19 vaccines was properly made in accordance with the statutory regime in place. In India, all new drug trials must follow a certain protocol with stringent statutory requirements as set forth in the Good Clinical Practices guidelines and be approved by the Ethics Committee and the Central Licensing Authority. The Ethics Committee, which is comprised of medical, scientific and non-medical and nonscientific members, is an independent review board that is tasked with providing an objective and independent review of the clinical trials.\n\nThe Union of India claimed that these strict clinical trial guidelines were followed for COVID vaccine clinical trials and that the main findings of trials have been published in a peer reviewed journal, in accordance with WHO requirements.\n\nThe Court: Ongoing COVID Vaccine Trial Data Must Be Publicly Available\n\nThe court agreed with the government and declined to mandate the disclosure of segregated clinical trial data, citing privacy reasons, and also declined to declare that COVID vaccine approvals were granted without proper review of clinical trial data. However, the court ordered that relevant data, which must be published under statutory regimes and WHO requirements for ongoing clinical trials, along with data from COVID vaccine post-marketing trials, be made available to the public without delay.\n\nDr. Puliyel advised the court that, because clinical trials are made up of a small subset of the population, not all adverse events may be seen during trials and, instead, may only be noticed once the vaccine is available to the public at large. He pointed out that, in 2018, the WHO changed the way it classified adverse events after vaccination to only consider adverse events as vaccine related when that same adverse reaction also occurred during previous smaller, limited clinical trials.\n\nIn other words:\n\nReactions observed during post-marketing surveillance are not considered as \u2018consistent with causal association with vaccine\u2019, if a significant increase in such reactions during Phase III trials had not been recorded.7\n\nIn the case of the COVID vaccine trials, phase III trials were cut short and then control subjects were offered the vaccine, which had the effect of diluting the control group and ultimately making it impossible to evaluate potential differences in long term health outcomes between the vaccinated and control groups. At the same time, it makes it more possible for doctors to dismiss adverse events that occur post COVID vaccination, as adverse events are less likely to be considered vaccine related events. Therefore, Dr. Puliyel asked that all post marketing adverse event data be made available to the public.\n\nHowever, the court declined to act, finding that the Phase III trials were cut short on the advice of the SEC, and stating that the government has protocols in place to consider and investigate adverse reactions to COVID vaccine, which only occur during the post-marketing phase.\n\nDr. Puliyel: India\u2019s Adverse Event Reporting System Should Be More Like VAERS\n\nDr. Puliyel contended that the vaccine adverse events reporting system in India is not transparent and complete data as on serious adverse events should be published like in the United States though the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The court pointed out that the National AEFI Surveillance Secretariat, which has been in place for a decade, has a protocol in place for identifying and monitoring adverse events to vaccination.\n\nHowever, Dr. Puliyel argued that the vaccine adverse event reporting system in India needs to be changed to allow individuals, as well as private doctors, to report adverse events like is done in the U.S. with VAERS. The court agreed and directed the Union of India to facilitate the reporting of vaccine adverse events by individuals, as well as private doctors, on a public on-line platform. The court said:\n\nInformation relating to adverse effects following immunisation is crucial for the purpose of understanding the safety of the vaccines that are being administered, apart from being instrumental in further scientific studies around the pandemic. There is an imminent need for collection of requisite data of adverse events and wider participation of people in reporting the adverse events is necessary for the purpose of gathering correct information.8\n\nThe Court: Pediatric COVID-19 Vaccination Program Will Stand\n\nDr. Puliyel presented evidence that children are not at high risk of severe illness from COVID and argued that the risk from COVID vaccination outweighs the risk of getting seriously ill from the virus, pointing out that a large number of children in India have already recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nThe court sided with the government, stating that it would not second-guess expert opinion as to the safety of pediatric COVID vaccinations. However, the court ordered the Union of India to immediately release the key findings and clinical trial results of Corbevax, the COVID vaccine that does not use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which is being given to children, if that data has not already been released.\n\nThe Supreme Court of India acknowledged that citizens have a liberty interest that prohibits forced vaccination; that restrictions placed on unvaccinated persons should be reviewed in light of the fact that the COVID vaccine does not prevent infection and transmission; that ongoing COVID vaccine clinical trial data should be publicly released, and that the government\u2019s vaccine adverse event reporting system should be improved. However, the court did not fully recognize and adequately respond to all of Dr. Puliyel\u2019s legitimate complaints about the government\u2019s COVID vaccination program.\n\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.\n\nClick here to view References:",
        "A scholarly article published in a medical journal, in which authors concluded that a \u201clack of clear benefit should cause governments to rethink their vaccination policy,\u201d has been retracted less than two weeks after publication. The article entitled \u201cThe Safety of COVID-19 Vaccinations\u2014We Should Rethink the Policy\u201d was published by MDPI (Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute) on June 24, 2021 and analyzed the information from international databases. The article was retracted on July 2.1\n\nThe article\u2019s authors used a large Israeli field study that included approximately one million people to calculate the number of individuals needed to vaccinate in order to prevent one infection and death caused by COVID-19. They then extracted numbers of side effects reported to the Dutch National Register for the Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines to calculate risk. Their findings indicated that \u201cfor three deaths prevented by vaccination, we have to accept two inflicted by vaccination\u2026 thus placing risks and benefits on the same order of magnitude.\u201d1\n\nUnderplaying Adverse Reactions by National Authorities and Media Outlets\n\nThe article\u2019s authors suggested that \u201cperhaps it might be necessary to dampen the enthusiasm with sober facts,\u201d1 stating the need for independent science case reviews of severe reactions, reconsideration of national policies, and evidence-based recommendations for vaccination on an individual case-by-case basis.\n\nThis stance is echoed in a recent Wall Street Journal opinion article, which criticizes the lack of media representation about the potential risks of the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as the politicization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the vaccine. The authors state that public health authorities are risking the public\u2019s trust by not being forthcoming about potential harms from the vaccine, and that \u201cthe battle to recover scientific honesty will be an uphill one in the U.S.\u201d2\n\nResearchers Resign Following Widespread Criticism and Article Retraction\n\nThe website Gizmodo was quick to publish an article entitled \u201cJournal Retracts Terrible Study that Claimed Widespread Covid-19 Vaccine Deaths\u201d two days following retraction of the journal article.3 The Gizmodo author states that the article was condemned as flawed and irresponsible by other scientists and that the well-respected researchers have since resigned from association with the journal. Following criticism, the journal article was retracted after the journal\u2019s editors said they found \u201cseveral errors that fundamentally affect the interpretation of the findings.\u201d3\n\nMainstream Media Alleges VAERS is Source of \u201cMisinformation\u201d\n\nGizmodo reports that adverse reporting systems such as the one used by the researchers who published the retracted article are designed to report any health problem or death after using a new drug or vaccine, but that the reports don\u2019t necessarily indicate the drug or vaccine caused the health problem or death. The Gizmodo article author states:\n\nBut caution should be warranted if someone starts making extraordinary claims about safety or lack thereof\u2014especially if those claims are based on adverse event reporting systems.3\n\nVaccine adverse event reporting systems, which many people did not know existed prior to the dissemination of experimental COVID-19 vaccines under an emergency use authorization (EUA) granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2020,4 increasingly have been criticized by the media as the numbers of serious health problem have been reported following COVID-19 vaccinations. Despite being credited for identifying the blood clots associated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine5 and myocarditis associated with the mRNA vaccines,6 many news outlets report that the U.S. based system VAERS (the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) is a tool used by those opposed to mandatory use of COVID-19 vaccine to emphasize vaccine risks and that the system is \u201cripe for abuse, misuse, and plain misunderstanding.\u201d5\n\nThe CDC\u2019s website describing VAERS clearly identifies limitations of using VAERS data to make conclusions about causal relationships between an adverse event report filed in VAERS and the vaccination(s) received. However, CDC officials also urge vaccine providers and recipients to report adverse events following vaccination to VAERS as required under the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act.7 There have been more adverse events, including deaths, reported to VAERS following COVID-19 vaccinations than for any other vaccine.8\n\nMost mainstream media outlets promoting the use of COVID-19 vaccine are critical of VAERS and minimize the significance of adverse event reports filed in VAERS. As ABC News states: \u201cAlthough VAERS contains millions of reports of injuries following vaccinations, the vast majority of those injuries are coincidental.\u201d5\n\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.\n\nClick here to view References:",
        "Epidemiologist and researcher, Paul Alexander, PhD warns that COVID-19 vaccination could permanently damage the innate immune system in children and prevent it from functioning and developing normally.1\n\nThe innate (cellular) immune system acts as the first line of defense against the challenge of pathogens causing infectious disease. When the innate immune system identifies pathogenic viruses, bacteria, parasites or toxins, it activates cells to attack and resist or repair damage.2 Exposure to pathogens trains the innate immune system to work properly and this training period during early childhood is integral to the development and maturation of the innate immune system.\n\nDr. Alexander maintains that, when young children are given a COVID shot that uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, their innate immune systems do not have the opportunity to learn how to properly respond. He contends that the vaccine antibodies bind to the SARS-CoV-2 virus\u2019s spike protein and prevent the innate immune system from doing its job. When the innate immune system is not able to develop naturally and learn how to differentiate between a normal cell and a pathogen, it can lead to autoimmune disorders.3\n\nDr. Alexander warned:\n\nSo, it is absolutely critical that the innate immune system, and particularly the innate antibodies very early on in childhood, be allowed this training.4\n\nA well-functioning innate immune system is critical to the body\u2019s effective response to a SARS-CoV-2 infection. A 2021 study in the Journal of Clinical Investigation Insight showed that children infected with COVID-19 fared better than infected adults because their innate immune prevented the virus from spreading.5 The study looked at 27 adults and 12 children infected with SARS-CoV-2 and found that the children\u2019s innate immune system mounted a better response to the virus than the adults. The children displayed, \u201ca more vigorous early mucosal immune response\u201d than the adults, allowing them to recover from the virus faster.6\n\nChanges to the Immune System Could Cause the Proliferation of Cancer Cells\n\nA June 2022 study published in Food and Chemical Toxicology reported that COVID vaccination causes a significant change in type 1 interferon (INF type 1) signaling, initiates changes in short- and long-term immune competence and normal cellular function, and plays, \u201ca critical role in both controlling viral proliferation and inducing antibody production.\u201d7 The study points out that INF 1 cells stop the growth of virus and cancer cells and are critical for the immune system to successfully fight viruses such as SARS-CoV-2.\n\nBecause the COVID vaccination has been shown to interfere with the proper functioning of INF 1, the study authors, which include Stephanie Seneff, PhD, are concerned that patients who received the vaccine may be more susceptable to catching the virus in the first two weeks immediately after vaccination.8 They said the COVID shot could also interfere with the immune system\u2019s recognition of and response to cancer cells because INF subtypes are especially important in preventing and recognizing cancer cells once they have formed.9\n\nSAR-CoV-2 Spike Protein in COVID Shots and BRCA2 Associated Cancers\n\nThe study authors argue that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein found in the COVID vaccines affects host cell exome production and causes the cells to create microRNA exomes that suppress the production of IRF9 and increase pro-inflammatory gene transcripts.10 They write:\n\nIRF9 suppression via exosomal microRNA should also be expected to impair the cancer-protective effects of BRCA2 gene activity, which depends on that molecule for its activity \u2026 BRCA2-associated cancers include breast, fallopian tube, and ovarian cancer for women, prostate and breast cancer for men, acute myeloid leukaemia in children, and others.11 Given the universally recognized importance of optimally functioning BRCA1/2 for cancer prevention and given the central role of the TRAIL signal transduction pathway for additional cancer surveillance, the suppression of IRF7 and IRF9 through vaccination and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein production is extremely concerning for long-term cancer control in SARS-CoV-2 mRNA genetic vaccine injected populations.12\n\nEuropean Medicines Agency Issues Warning About Repeat Booster Doses\n\nA study published in The Lancet provided evidence that immune function can be adversely affected by COVID vaccines. According to the study, those who received two doses of the vaccine had lower immune function after eight months than those who did not take the vaccine.13\n\nOne proposed cause of the decreased immune function is that N1 methylpseudouridine, which is part of the vaccine\u2019s genetic code, could activate regulatory T cells and lead to lowered cellular immunity, which can prevent spike proteins from immediately decaying and, instead, circulating through the body for at least four months after vaccination. The authors note that lipid nanoparticles containing mRNA are inflammatory and have also been shown to accumulate in the ovaries, adrenal glands, liver and spleen, with the spike protein potentially causing vascular endothelial cells to be damaged and affect immune system organs.14\n\nAdverse effects of COVID vaccines was confirmed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which recommended that frequent COVID vaccine boosters could negatively impact immune responses to the virus. The agency said that the booster doses should be spaced out further than every four months.\n\nThe head of EMA\u2019s office of biological health threats and vaccines strategy, Marco Cavaleri, PhD, warned,\n\nWe are rather concerned about a strategy that entangles repeated vaccinations within a short term. We cannot really continuously give booster doses every 3-4 months\u2026 There are two concerns here: If we have a strategy in which we give boosters, let\u2019s say, every four months approximately, we will end up potentially having problems with the immune response, and the immune response may not be as good as we would like it to be. So we should be careful in not overloading the immune system with repeated immunization. \u201cAnd secondly, there is the risk of fatigue in the population with the continuous administration of boosters.\u201d15\n\nReinhard Obst, PhD, professor at Ludwig Maximilian University\u2019s Institute of Immunology in Germany, believes that Dr. Cavaleri\u2019s warning is reasonable. He said:\n\nThe idea of vaccinating every four months or even more than that is novel. It\u2019s something that you haven\u2019t seen with other types of viruses. And the idea of T cell exhaustion is the reason why you might pause.16\n\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.\n\nClick here to view References:",
        "The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, Louisiana, in a change of heart from its Apr. 7, 2022 decision, agreed to hear arguments against the Biden administration\u2019s vaccine mandate for federal workers. The court will hear the matter en banc which means that there will be a full panel of judges convened. This decision vacates the court\u2019s previous ruling which reinstated the vaccine mandate for federal workers. Therefore, the COVID-19 vaccine mandate for federal workers has once again been paused.1 2 3\n\nImplementation of the COVID vaccine mandate will be delayed until at least September when the full court will hear arguments. The Biden administration has announced that they will not process or make any decisions regarding medical or religious exemptions to the mandate or suspend or fire any workers for failing to comply with President Biden\u2019s mandate pending the court\u2019s decision.4\n\nThe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals previous decision reinstated the vaccine mandate for federal workers based on the court\u2019s conclusion that the president of the United States has the power to order to federal employees to get vaccinated, while federal judges do not have jurisdiction to interfere. Because the court found that they did not have authority to override the president in matters like this, the judges did not rule on the merits of the case. In September, the same court en banc may be more likely to consider all arguments and make a decision on the merits of the case.5\n\nHistory of the COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate for Federal Workers\n\nIn September 2021, the Biden administration ordered that all federal workers receive a COVID vaccination as a condition of employment. In January 2022, however, a Federal District Court in Texas issued a preliminary injunction against the mandate, which halted the vaccine requirement for federal workers. The court blocked the mandate, finding that it exceeded the President\u2019s authority and required Congressional approval.6 The judges ruled:\n\n\u2026 no legal remedy adequately protects the liberty interests of employees who must choose between violating a mandate of doubtful validity or consenting to an unwanted medical procedure that cannot be undone.7\n\nThe Biden administration appealed the decision. In February, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Texas District Court\u2019s temporary injunction pending the outcome of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals final ruling.8\n\nOn Apr. 7, however, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found for the Biden administration and held that the federal vaccine mandate must be reinstated, and the case dismissed. The court held that a federal judge does not have jurisdiction over federal employees challenging the vaccine mandate and redress is found exclusively under Civil Service Law.9 The court said that the President, as CEO of the executive branch, has proper authority to issue a mandate on federal employees.10\n\nAdvocacy Group Feds for Medical Freedom Presses On\n\nThe ruling reinstating the mandate effective May 23, faced a challenge when an advocacy group called Feds for Medical Freedom and other interested parties filed a petition seeking to overturn the decision and requested that the full 17-member court hear new arguments in the matter.11\n\nFeds for Medical Freedom, which has over 6,000 members, argues that the President\u2019s unilateral decision to affect the lives of millions of federal employees is, \u201ca matter of exceptional importance,\u201d which necessitates a hearing en banc. The group also contends that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s April opinion contradicts previous court precedent with regard to pre-enforcement challenges.12\n\nMarcus Thronton, president of Feds for Medical Freedom, pointed out the high stakes of this case stating:\n\nA policy that threatens to derail or end the careers of dedicated public servants who do not consent to take a COVID vaccine is both unconstitutional and immoral.13\n\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.\n\nClick here to view References:",
        "Pediatrician Paul Halczenko, MD awaits a decision in an appeal he filed against Ascension Health, his employer for the last ten years. Dr. Halczenko and four other health care workers, were put on leave from their job at Peyton Manning Children\u2019s Hospital at Ascension St. Vincent Hospital after refusing to be vaccinated for COVID-19 for religious reasons when it was mandated as a condition of employment for 14,700 employees in Indiana.1 2\n\nDr. Halczenko is one of only three pediatric intensive care unit doctors in Indiana. He and four other health care workers sued Ascension and St. Vincent Hospital for violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act \u201cby systematically and callously failing to accommodate their religious beliefs and denying their requests for exemption without giving individualized consideration of, or individualized responses to, each request.\u201d3\n\nDoctor Alleges Religious Discrimination\n\nThe four other health care workers who filed suit along with the doctor were allowed to return to work when Ascension repealed the vaccine mandate in December 2021. However, Dr. Halczenko, who works in critical care for pediatric patients, was told that he was not allowed to return to work.4 William Bock III, attorney for the doctor, points out that no reason was given as to why the doctor was singled out and prevented from returning to work along with the other previously suspended workers. He said:\n\nWe have no explanation for why Dr. Halczenko is treated differently. We believe that it\u2019s religious discrimination.5\n\nDr. Halczenko argued that, should he not be granted a preliminary injunction and be allowed to return to work, his skills as a highly specialized pediatric intensive care doctor as well as his reputation would suffer irreparable harm. However, Judge James Patrick Hanlon denied the doctor\u2019s request for a temporary injunction stating that he found that the doctor, \u201chas failed to make a \u2018substantial showing\u2019 of irreparable injury\u201d that would necessitate him being reinstated in his position by way of a temporary injunction.6\n\nThe court stated that, should he prevail on the Title VII claims, Dr. Halczenko could ultimately be made whole without the court issuing a preliminary injunction.7\n\nAt the same time, the court noted that Ascension provided almost no supporting evidence as to the reason why the doctor\u2019s religious exemption was denied, but concluded that the defendant\u2019s motivation behind the denial of the accommodation is not a matter to be resolved at a preliminary injunction hearing.\n\nDoctor Argues the COVID Vaccine Does Not Prevent Transmission of Infection\n\nThe judge, failing to find that the doctor\u2019s reputation would suffer an irreparable injury as a result of being put on administrative leave due to his religious beliefs, wrote:\n\nAnd, here the claimed reputational injury\u2014and corresponding impediment to finding a comparable job\u2014would arise from the undisputed, truthful fact that Dr. Halczenko\u2019s employment was terminated because he did not get vaccinated against COVID-19\u201d8\n\nDr. Halczenko defended his position, saying:\n\nWell, first I would say I am following the science. The preponderance of the evidence suggests and even as we know no \u2014not necessarily at the time of the lawsuit, but certainly in the intervening weeks and months\u2014that vaccination does not actually prevent transmission. So, the best protection that I can offer to my patients is to use the personal protective equipment and the other measures that are employed by health care workers across the world and have been demonstrated to be effective.9\n\nAscension responded to these allegations\u2026\n\nIt is in the public\u2019s interest to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and reduce the risk of serious illness to St. Vincent\u2019s patients, employees, and visitors. This public interest in reducing the risk of transmission among patients and employees outweighs any interest asserted by Halczenko.10\n\nThis matter was heard before the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals on May 31 and a decision is pending.11\n\nAscension Health Faces More Lawsuits Due to Its COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate\n\nA group of 64 health care workers are also suing Ascension Health and St. Vincent Hospital in a class action lawsuits for having been suspended without pay after they refused to take the COVID-19 vaccine. The employees objected to the vaccine on religious grounds and filed religious exemption to the vaccine mandate. The employees argue that Ascension failed to properly assess each individual religious exemption application.[12]\n\nThe lawsuit alleges:\n\nAscension Health established a coercive process calculated to force healthcare workers and staff to abandon their religious objections to the COVID-19 vaccination and receive the vaccination against their will.13\n\nThe employees were suspended without pay beginning Nov. 12, 2021 and told that, if they failed to get the vaccine by Jan. 4, 2022, they would be fired. In December, Ascension repealed the vaccine mandate and allowed the employees who filed a religious exemption to return to work.\n\nThe employees are requesting that Ascension be found guilty of violating federal discrimination laws and be ordered to pay them for the time they were suspended, as well as other compensation.14\n\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.\n\nClick here to view References:",
        "On July 4, 2022, Canadian Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said Canadians may be required to get a COVID-19 booster shot every nine months to protect themselves against new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Duclos said, \u201cThe virus evolves and Omicron made us aware we will never be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. We have to maintain our vaccinations up to date.\u201d1\n\nCurrently in Canada, \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d is defined by Health Canada as having two doses of any of the public health agency\u2019s approved COVID vaccine.2\n\n\u201cFully Vaccinated\u201d Makes No Sense Anymore Says Canadian Health Minister\n\nMinister Duclos\u2019 message may be directed to people who have not received their first booster.3 Government officials in Canada have said that, as of June 19, 2022, almost 81 percent of the total population has received the first two COVID shots but only 49 percent of the population has received a booster shot.4\n\nColin Furness, PhD, an epidemiologist from the University of Toronto and Nazeem Muhajarine, PhD, an epidemiologist from University of Saskatchewan, said that uptake for the third dose of a COVID shot has been slow in comparison to that of the first and second doses due to the fact that the vaccine was initially presented to the public as being comprised of two doses, giving people the idea that was all they needed to do to prevent having a serious case of COVID disease.5\n\nDr. Furness said:\n\nThat\u2019s the mental model that most people had. So when we started to say you kind of need a third dose now \u2026 [they] said, \u2018You sold us an idea that there was a two-dose vaccine and I signed on, now you\u2019re changing the deal and I don\u2019t like that, I\u2019m walking away.\u20196\n\nWhen asked if the COVID vaccine mandate would return in the fall of 2022, Minister Duclos responded:\n\nWe must continue to fight against COVID. We want to be prepared for next fall, and that requires an up-to-date vaccination, which is based on the nine months.7\n\nMinister Duclos also made it clear that no one is \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d anymore. He said:\n\nNine months is very clear and will help people understand why \u2018up-to-date\u2019 is the right way to think about vaccination now. Fully vaccinated\u2019 makes no sense now. It\u2019s about \u2018up-to-date.\u2019 So am I up-to-date in my vaccination? Have I received a vaccination in the last nine months?\u201d He added that, \u201cUp-to-date\u2019 means you have received your last dose in the past nine months. If you\u2019ve already received a first booster, that\u2019s great. Please see if you\u2019re eligible for a second or third booster to remain up-to-date.8\n\nMajority of Canadians Willing to Get a COVID Booster\n\nAccording to the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) conducted in the fall of 2021, 86 percent of Canadians aged 12 and older reported that they were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat likely\u201d to get a COVID booster shot.9\n\nThe survey showed differences across different populations with respect to willingness to receive a COVID booster dose. From September to mid-November 2021, women were slightly more likely than men to report being willing to get a booster dose (87 percent versus 85 percent). Among youth aged 12 to 17.84 percent reported a willingness to get a booster, which was similar to adults aged 18 to 49 (83 percent). Older Canadians aged 50 and older reported higher booster dose willingness (89 percent) compared with the younger age groups.10\n\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.\n\nClick here to view References:",
        "Officials in some cities in China have ordered all indoor pets belonging to SARS-CoV-2 patients to be killed due to fear that the animals could transmit the virus to other humans.1\n\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, which reportedly originated in a wet food market or biohazard lab in Wuhan, China in late 2019, government officials in China have been implementing a zero-transmission policy in an attempt to eradicate the virus. Chinese public health officials believe the zero-COVID policy will stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 but,2 despite taking more and more extreme measures to prevent transmission of the virus.3 4\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials have stated that the risk of animals spreading SARS-CoV-2 to human beings is low but that the virus can spread from people to animals during close contact.5\n\nPublic Health Officials Tell Anci District to Kill Pets of SARS-CoV-2 Patients\n\nOn the morning of Mar. 30, 2022, Anci District Prevention and Control Office issued a notice stating:\n\nIn order to ensure the safety of positive patients returning home, after communicating with the Langfang City Center for Disease Control and Prevention, it is necessary to comprehensively and thoroughly kill the animals domesticated by positive patients as soon as possible.6\n\nThe Office of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau of Anci District, which is responsible for designating professional culling teams, confirmed that it had received the notice from public health officials at the Anci District Prevention and Control Office.7\n\nBy 5:00 pm on Mar. 30, 2022, reportedly the \u201corder\u201d had been halted due to public outrage. It is not known how many pets had been killed before the order was suspended.8\n\nPets Reportedly Killed While Owners Were in Quarantine\n\nA Chinese woman who identified herself as Ms. Fu said that she was asked to quarantine in the city of Shangrao after government contact tracers said she had been in close contact with someone who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. She tested negative for the virus.9 She was not able to quarantine with her dog. However, community workers assured her the corgi would be taken care of in her home while she was away.\n\nHome security camera showed community workers taking Ms. Fu\u2019s dog away, after which he was killed. The video went viral on China\u2019s social media platform known as Weibo, causing public outrage.10\n\nAnother woman from the city of Harbin said that her three cats were killed in September 2021 while she was in quarantine. It has been also reported that authorities in cities of Chengdu and Wuxi have entered homes of people that are in quarantine and killed their pets.11\n\nDuring the course of the coronavirus pandemic, authorities in China have killed pets on several occasions, resulting in conflicts between local governments and citizens.12\n\nMetal Barriers Go Up in Shanghai Apartment Complexes\n\nAssociated Press reported on Apr. 24 that Chinese officials were erecting metal barrier fences in neighborhoods around buildings and apartment complexes in Shanghai, where they believe people are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Apparently, public health officials have identified more than 21,000 new COVID-19 cases with most of the cases being asymptomatic and driven by the omicron variant circulating in Shanghai.13\n\nAccording to the AP story, many residents in the city have had trouble getting groceries and access to medical care because of the barriers and strict controls on movement. A video circulated on the internet earlier in April heard Chinese people subjected to draconian lockdown measures screaming from their apartments \u201cSend us food!

        "Opinion | It is interesting to observe the mainstream media\u2019s reporting of the recent news that Governor Greg Abbott of Texas has tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. For example, the headline of an article by CNBC reads, \u201cTexas Gov. Abbott, who banned mask and vaccine mandates, tests positive for Covid.\u201d Another headline by Yahoo! News reads, \u201cTexas Gov. Greg Abbott, who opposes vaccine and mask mandates, tests positive for COVID-19.\u201d Another one by The Guardian reads, \u201cTexas governor Greg Abbott, who fought mask mandates, tests positive for Covid.\u201d1 2 3\n\nA CNN headline reads, \u201cGov. Abbott tests positive for Covid-19 after months of blocking mask mandates.\u201d One more\u2014this one by BuzzFeed News: \u201cTexas Gov. Greg Abbott Tested Positive For COVID-19, As He Fights Mask Mandates.\u201d4 5\n\nThere appears to be an orchestrated effort by the mainstream media of trying to convey a subtle message of poetic justice that goes something like this: \u201cThat\u2019ll teach Abbott for being such an obstructionist on mask mandates in his state. Serves him right.\u201d It is a message that is consistent with a disturbing and growing tendency by some Americans to shame and vilify fellow Americans who do not share their enthusiasm for every government COVID-related mandate that comes along.\n\nMedia Tries to Tie Abbott\u2019s Coronavirus Infection to His Stance on Mask Mandates\n\nAll of these articles are supposed to be news articles, but from the start they already betray a clear political bias. Gov. Abbott and Gov. Rick DeSantis of Florida have been taking a lot of heat lately from government officials and the media for prohibiting cities and school boards in their states from passing mask mandates for children attending schools. Both Abbott and DeSantis believe that parents should decide whether or not their children wear masks in schools.6 7 8\n\nIn a statement on July 29, 2021 about the Executive Order he signed on May 18 prohibiting government entities in Texas from mandating masks,9 Gov. Abbott said:\n\n[Parents] have the individual right and responsibility to decide for themselves and their children whether they will wear masks, open their businesses, and engage in leisure activities. Vaccines, which remain in abundant supply, are the most effective defense against the virus, and they will always remain voluntary\u2014never forced\u2014in the State of Texas7\n\nIn other words, Gov. Abbott\u2019s order doesn\u2019t prohibit children from wearing masks in schools, it simply prohibits Texas state authorities from forcing them to do so.\n\nOn Aug. 15, the Texas Supreme Court upheld Gov. Abbott\u2019s mask mandate prohibition by granting a request for a \u201ctemporary, emergency stay\u201d of an appellate court ruling that would have allowed schools in Dallas and Bexar counties to require masks. In another case involving Travis county, the Texas Supreme Court on Aug. 19 denied Gov. Abbott\u2019s request to \u201cblock temporary restraining orders\u201d on his mask mandate prohibition. That decision effectively allows schools that require students to wear masks, in defiance of Gov. Abbott\u2019s mask mandate prohibition, to proceed.10\n\nOn Aug. 3, President Joe Biden called out Gov. Abbott, Gov. DeSantis and other governors for \u201cpassing laws or signing orders that forbid people from doing the right thing.\u201d Biden noted, \u201cAs of now, seven states not only banned mask mandates, but also banned them in their school districts, even for young children who cannot get vaccinated.\u201d7 He added:\n\nLook, we need leadership from everyone. If some governors are not willing to do the right thing, then they should allow businesses and universities who want to do the right thing, to be able to do it. I say to these governors, please help. If you\u2019re not going to help, at least get out of the way of the people trying to do the right thing. Use your power to save lives.6 7 11\n\nMore recently, U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona admonished Gov. Abbott and Gov. DeSantis for their executive orders on mask mandates. In a letter to Gov. Abbott, Secretary Cardona wrote that his order \u201cmay infringe upon a school district\u2019s authority to adopt policies to protect students and educators as they develop their safe return to in-person instruction plans required by federal law.\u201d12 Cardona added:\n\nThe Department [of Education] stands with these dedicated educators who are working to safely reopen schools and maintain safe in-person instruction.12\n\nAbbott Received Three COVID Shots and Still Got Coronavirus\n\nThe bias that is evident in some of the media coverage about Gov. Abbott\u2019s positive test for coronavirus seems aimed at pressuring Abbott to see the error of his ways by seeking to remind him how contagious is the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the need for requiring people to abide by the federal government\u2019s masking recommendations. But perhaps the media bias is also meant to distract from a more noteworthy detail of this story, which is that Gov. Abbott is fully vaccinated.\n\nGov. Abbott received the first dose of Pfizer/BioNTech\u2019s experimental messenger RNA (mRNA) biologic (known as BNT162b2 or Comirnaty vaccine) on Dec. 22, 2020 and likely received the second dose in January 2021. He reportedly received a third shot\u2014a booster dose\u2014as well. \u201cGovernor Abbott is fully vaccinated against COVID-19, in good health, and currently experiencing no symptoms,\u201d said Mark Miner, the governor\u2019s communications director.13 14 15 16 17\n\nSo even with three Comirnaty shots in less than one year, Gov. Abbott still tested positive for coronavirus? That would seem to be the most relevant and concerning point on which to focus. Not his stand on mask mandates.\n\nGov. Abbott can now be added to the growing club of so-called \u201cbreakthrough cases\u201d of Americans who contracted coronavirus despite being fully vaccinated. The latest rough estimate of the number breakthrough cases in the United States is 193,204, as reported recently by The Wall Street Journal.18 That figure, however, is based on data provided by only by 44 state health departments and a lack of understanding of how many vaccinated Americans have been asymptomatically infected, so you can bet that the estimate is woefully low.18 19 20 21\n\nIt is worth noting that there are some media sources that have at least made an effort to highlight the relevance of Gov. Abbott\u2019s vaccination status. NBC affiliate WAVY-TV in Portsmouth, Virginia reported, \u201cGov. Greg Abbott tests positive for COVID despite being fully vaccinated.\u201d Similar examples, though, are rare\n\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.\n\nNote: This commentary provides referenced information and perspective on a topic related to vaccine science, policy, law or ethics being discussed in public forums and by U.S. lawmakers.

        "A student at Union College was unenrolled and forced to leave the campus in upstate New York after she refused to take a COVID-19 booster shot. The pre-med biology and Spanish language student suffered severe adverse reactions after receiving the first series of Pfizer/BioNTech COVID shots in the fall.1\n\nSophomore Ellie Puentes is a first-generation student who attended Union College on academic scholarship. Puentes received the first set of COVID vaccines when the college required the shots in order to attend school. Immediately afterwards, Puentes suffered from sharp adnominal pain landing her in a hospital emergency room for hours. She still suffers from constant nausea, vomiting, chest pains and shortness of breath.2\n\nPuentes said:\n\nJust the other day I wake up randomly just puking and I don\u2019t know what the cause of that is, and then on top of that, I have shortness of breath. I can\u2019t work out like I used to. I\u2019m getting chest pains where this never happened prior to the vaccine. And I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on! \u201cThe puking happens more often than I would say the diarrhea and the shortness of breath. \u2026 I get these sharp pains in my chest and even my immune system, I believe, has just gone down. I\u2019ve been more sick than I\u2019ve ever been.3\n\nCollege Rejects Medical Exemption to COVID Booster\n\nWhen the college recently announced that boosters would be mandatory, Puentes e-mailed the school explaining her situation and the severe adverse reactions she had to the first series of COVID shots and asked to speak to the administrative staff in person about this issue. That request was denied, and Puentes was expelled from school and ordered to leave campus via e-mail. [4] The school refused a letter from Puentes long-time doctor who stated the COVID vaccine booster shot was \u201cill-advised\u201d5 as well as the paperwork she received from the hospital after her visit post COVID vaccination.6\n\nThe letter Puentes\u2019 doctor sent to the college read in part\u2026\n\nMs. Puentes is a 20-year-old who has had severe, prolonged symptoms since receiving her COVID vaccines\u2026She missed one week of school after the shot\u2026it is my opinion that Ms. Puentes be granted an exception from receiving the booster COVID vaccine. She currently is in an unfavorable state of health, presumably caused by the vaccine itself and getting the vaccine is ill advised.7\n\nDespite Union College purportedly allowing exemptions to vaccination for approved medical and religious reasons, the doctor\u2019s letter was ignored by college officials.8\n\nBoth Puentes\u2019 doctor and the doctors in the emergency room diagnosed her with gastritis. However, Union College denied that gastritis could be an adverse reaction to the shot. The school nurse told her to just get Moderna\u2019s Spikevax COVID biologic this time, which uses the same messenger RNA (mRNA) technology as Pfizer/BioNtech Comirnaty COVID biologic, if she was concerned about the reactions she had to Comirnaty.9\n\nPfizer/BioNTech Confirms Reaction Was Likely from COVID Shot\n\nUndeterred, Puentes reached out to Pfizer to inquire whether her severe symptoms could be due to the vaccines she was forced to get to attend college. Puentes said Pfizer confirmed her fears stating, \u201cThey confirmed that the symptoms I\u2019m having could be or are related to the vaccine because they have seen others with the same reactions.\u201d10\n\nUnion College officials discounted the vaccine manufacturer\u2019s confirmation that other people were diagnosed with gastritis like Puentes and that her symptoms were likely from the Comirnaty vaccine. Puentes was denied a medical exemption to the COVID vaccine requirement and she was expelled from school.11\n\nThe school\u2019s actions are not supported by government policy as the federal health officials consider individuals, who have received the initial two dose series of COVID shots, to be fully vaccinated and they have not changed the definition of \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d to include booster doses. However, despite the federal government stance, Union College is not alone in demanding receipt of COVID booster doses. A number of private businesses and schools are mandating the COVID booster shot as proof a person is \u201cfully vaccinated.\u201d New York University, Harvard, Princeton, Yale, the University of Notre Dame, the University of Michigan and Northwestern are among the other universities that require a COVID booster for attendance.12 13\n\nPuentes\u2019 friends started a GoFundMe account to help her pay for the remaining weeks she had on campus and to raise money for a lawyer.14 GoFundMe, an online fund raising platform, shut Puentes\u2019 account down silencing her friends\u2019 efforts to help the young college student.15>\n\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.\n\nClick here to view References:",
        "The National Guard is a unique branch of the U.S. military that holds both state and national responsibilities ranging from responding to domestic natural disasters to supporting overseas operations. But tens of thousands of National Guard troops are at risk of being discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine, worrying lawmakers on Capitol Hill that the Guard will be left crippled.\n\nApproximately 40,000 National Guard and 22,000 Reserve troops did not receive their COVID vaccines by the June 30 deadline that was set in place by the Biden administration and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. Those who failed to comply were cut off from some benefits and barred from participation in certain military duties. As of July 27, the total number of unvaccinated members of the Guard and Reserve hovers at 39,600.1\n\nDue to both the state and international duties of the Guard, federal officials and governors have argued over who has the final legal say on the vaccine mandates. This has allowed for Guard and Reserve troops to have an extended deadline of seven months longer than other service members.\n\nMilitary Facing Lowest Recruiting Numbers Since Vietnam War\n\nEvery branch of the military is already facing recruiting difficulties. Military recruitment numbers are the lowest they have been since the Vietnam War. The Army is expecting to reach only 40 percent of its recruitment target for the fiscal year\u2014missing its recruiting goal by 40,000 individuals.2\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about states potentially losing up to 20 percent to 30 percent of their guardsmen and women, replacing them in a very difficult recruiting environment, much less getting them trained to the capability they once were\u201d said Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida. \u201cWhen the next crisis comes to our shores the U.S. will lack the number [of] Guardsmen and women to come to our rescue.\u201d1\n\nOver 1,000 members of the Marine Corps have been discharged for refusal to comply with the vaccine mandate; 469 discharged from the Navy, 287 from the Air Force, and 345 from the Army.3\n\nPentagon Refuses to Budge on COVID Vaccine Mandates\n\nDespite lawmakers, governors, and others pushing back against the mandates, Austin has refused to budge, citing national security. Defense Secretary Austin argues that service members who get COVID disease are not able to work, which jeopardizes the ability to meet combat mission requirements. Secretary Austin wrote to governors that vaccination is key to maintain a healthy military force and to protecting the American people.4\n\nKatherine Kuzminski, director of the Military, Veterans, and Society program, stated:\n\nThe whole foundation of military action and conflict is based upon the ability to follow through with a lawful order\u2026they don\u2019t necessarily want to retain people who have indicated that they won\u2019t follow a lawful order when it comes to vaccination.1\n\nSeveral Republican governors are fighting the vaccine mandate for their National Guard troops, with governors from Alaska, Oklahoma, and Texas filing lawsuits over the mandate.3\n\nRep. Waltz, a 26-year veteran, said:\n\nI fully understand\u2026 good order and discipline and \u2018an order is an order\u2019. You order the platoon to charge the machine gun on the top of the hill, they\u2019ve got to follow it. But I also think it\u2019s incumbent on us as leaders to constantly evaluate the cost and the risk of our orders. Maybe charging that hill is going to be too costly to that unit.1\n\nIf you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.\n\nClick here to view References:",
        "America First Legal (AFL), a non-profit organization based in Washington, DC that works to defend American citizens from unconstitutional government overreach, released documents from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealing evidence of collusion between the CDC and major social media corporations to censor free speech on the COVID-19 pandemic and promote a COVID narrative set forth by federal government agencies.1 2\n\nWhite House Admitted To Working With Facebook to Limit \u201cMisinformation\u201d in 2021\n\nIn 2021, former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that the Biden administration was working in collaboration with Facebook to limit misinformation on COVID vaccines.3 Psaki stated:\n\nSo we\u2019re regularly making sure social media platforms are aware of the latest narratives, dangerous to public health that we and many other Americans are seeing across all of social and traditional media. And we work to engage with them to better understand the enforcement of social media platform policies.4\n\nPsaki also said that if a user is banned for spreading \u201cmisinformation\u201d on one social media platform, they should be banned from all other social media platforms as well.5 She noted that the federal government does not directly get involved in controlling information on social media sites but that social media companies make those decisions. Psaki said:\n\nWe don\u2019t take anything down. We don\u2019t block anything, Facebook, and any private sector company makes decisions about what information should be on their platform. Our point is that there is information that is leading to people not taking the vaccine.6\n\nAmerica First Legal Sues CDC to Release Records on Censorship\n\nFollowing Psaki\u2019s press conference in 2021, AFL submitted Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for documents, records and communications relating to the Biden administration decision to direct social media companies to censor speech pertaining to the COVID pandemic on their platforms.7\n\nStephen Miller, President of AFL stated:\n\nJen Psaki has unwittingly confirmed a shocking truth: the White House is using massive Big Tech companies as a censorship arm of the federal government. If true, this means that Big Tech censorship is state censorship and thus facially unconstitutional. There is no dividing line between government and big tech\u2014it is an incestuous union, and you cannot tell where one ends and one begins\u2026 AFL is filing these urgent FOIA requests so the full scope of this earth-shaking scandal will be revealed\u2014and so that, in turn, this unconstitutional behavior can be ended.8\n\nThe FOIA requests were delayed, after which AFL took further action and filed a lawsuit against the CDC on Apr. 8, 2022 to the release all information in order to assess CDC\u2019s collaboration with social media companies in determining what it deemed as COVID \u201cmisinformation\u201d.9\n\nGene Hamilton, Vice President and General Counsel of AFL said:\n\nWhat is surprising is that it took litigation to pry these records loose from the federal government, and that the Administration apparently has no qualms about violating the First Amendment in pursuit of its ideological goals.

        "America First Legal (AFL), a non-profit organization based in Washington, DC that works to defend American citizens from unconstitutional government overreach, released documents from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealing evidence of collusion between the CDC and major social media corporations to censor free speech on the COVID-19 pandemic and promote a COVID narrative set forth by federal government agencies.1 2\n\nWhite House Admitted To Working With Facebook to Limit \u201cMisinformation\u201d in 2021\n\nIn 2021, former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that the Biden administration was working in collaboration with Facebook to limit misinformation on COVID vaccines.3 Psaki stated:\n\nSo we\u2019re regularly making sure social media platforms are aware of the latest narratives, dangerous to public health that we and many other Americans are seeing across all of social and traditional media. And we work to engage with them to better understand the enforcement of social media platform policies.4\n\nPsaki also said that if a user is banned for spreading \u201cmisinformation\u201d on one social media platform, they should be banned from all other social media platforms as well.5 She noted that the federal government does not directly get involved in controlling information on social media sites but that social media companies make those decisions. Psaki said:\n\nWe don\u2019t take anything down. We don\u2019t block anything, Facebook, and any private sector company makes decisions about what information should be on their platform. Our point is that there is information that is leading to people not taking the vaccine.6\n\nAmerica First Legal Sues CDC to Release Records on Censorship\n\nFollowing Psaki\u2019s press conference in 2021, AFL submitted Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for documents, records and communications relating to the Biden administration decision to direct social media companies to censor speech pertaining to the COVID pandemic on their platforms.7\n\nStephen Miller, President of AFL stated:\n\nJen Psaki has unwittingly confirmed a shocking truth: the White House is using massive Big Tech companies as a censorship arm of the federal government. If true, this means that Big Tech censorship is state censorship and thus facially unconstitutional. There is no dividing line between government and big tech\u2014it is an incestuous union, and you cannot tell where one ends and one begins\u2026 AFL is filing these urgent FOIA requests so the full scope of this earth-shaking scandal will be revealed\u2014and so that, in turn, this unconstitutional behavior can be ended.8\n\nThe FOIA requests were delayed, after which AFL took further action and filed a lawsuit against the CDC on Apr. 8, 2022 to the release all information in order to assess CDC\u2019s collaboration with social media companies in determining what it deemed as COVID \u201cmisinformation\u201d.9\n\nGene Hamilton, Vice President and General Counsel of AFL said:\n\nWhat is surprising is that it took litigation to pry these records loose from the federal government, and that the Administration apparently has no qualms about violating the First Amendment in pursuit of its ideological goals. The federal government is not the arbiter of truth for the American people.10\n\nHigh Level Coordination Between CDC and Social Media Corps to Censor COVID Information\n\nAfter filing the lawsuit, AFL was able to obtain 286 pages of documents revealing communications between federal agencies and social media companies on how to censor information on COVID on their platforms.

        "Published: June 2022\n\nShare on: TW / FB / TG\n\n\n\nMagic potion or snake oil? An honest look at the international data.\n\nAbstract\n\nPrior to the omicron variant, covid vaccine protection against infection decreased from 95% to 0% and protection against severe disease and death in senior citizens decreased from 95% to 50% within about half a year. Since omicron, which is both milder and more infectious, vaccine protection against infection decreases from 60% to 0% and protection against severe disease in senior citizens decreases from at most 80% to less than 50% within a few months.\n\nThere is no difference in viral load and infectiousness between vaccinated and unvaccinated people; no evidence that vaccination reduces the risk of mild or moderate covid; and no evidence that vaccination reduces the risk of long covid in non-senior citizens. Prior covid infection continues to provide a more durable protection against reinfection.\n\nThus, while the risk/benefit ratio appears to remain positive in senior citizens and other covid risk groups, this does not appear to be the case in healthy young adults and children, as vaccine adverse events remain an issue. Finally, both \u201cvaccine passports\u201d and vaccine mandates, even for healthcare workers, have no medical or epidemiological justification and should be abandoned.\n\nIntroduction: Different positions towards covid vaccines\n\nThere are three different, fundamental positions towards covid vaccines than can be distinguished:\n\nPositive/promotional: This is the position taken by vaccine manufacturers, many politicians and many (but not all) health agencies. It is typically driven by commercial or political considerations. In addition, many scientists who depend on government or industry money or who want to publish in high-impact journals have also taken a promotional position.\n\nNegative/adverse: This is the position taken by vaccine skeptics. An adverse position can be based on various considerations, such as: 1) a fundamental rejection of vaccines in general; 2) a rejection of covid vaccines in particular, e.g. due to their novel technology and/or limited trial data; 3) a rejection of vaccines produced by companies with no track record (Moderna, Biontech) or with a criminal track record (Pfizer, Johnson&Johnson, AstraZeneca); 4) or based on strategic considerations (e.g. \u2018vaccine passports\u2019 as potential tools of population control).\n\nNeutral / skeptical but open-minded: This is the position taken by some independent investigators and research groups, including Swiss Policy Research. This group of analysts tries to obtain and provide as comprehensive and as nuanced a picture as possible on both vaccine effectiveness and vaccine safety, as well as on strategic considerations.\n\nDifferent aspects of vaccine protection\n\nIn the following analysis, we will distinguish between protection against (symptomatic) infection and protection against severe disease (hospitalization, ICU, death). Furthermore, we will distinguish between the pre-omicron period and the omicron period, and between senior citizens and non-senior citizens. Unless otherwise stated, protection refers to mRNA vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna) and is expressed in relative percentage terms.\n\nProtection against infection\n\nPrior to omicron (i.e. during the alpha and delta periods), several large studies showed that vaccine protection against symptomatic infection decreased from about 90%/95% shortly after vaccination to close to 0% within about half a year (Lancet). This decrease was first seen in Israel during the delta wave in summer 2021 (SPR).\n\nThere have been claims that vaccine protection \u201cturns negative\u201d at some point beyond half a year. However, based on the currently available data, it looks like vaccinated people, who enjoyed a lower infection rate for about half a year, are simply \u201ccatching up\u201d with unvaccinated people, but their infection risk is not actually higher than in unvaccinated people without prior infection (which would require some kind of immune suppression). This analysis is backed by the fact that a \u201cbooster vaccination\u201d restores protection against infection to the initial level, but again only for a short period of time (Lancet).\n\nSince omicron, vaccine protection against infection starts at 50%-60% shortly after vaccination and decreases to 0% within 4 to 6 months. A booster vaccination restores protection to 50%-60%, but again only for a short period of time. (NEJM) The lower peak protection is due to the partial immune escape of the omicron variant.\n\nIn contrast to vaccine protection, a previous covid infection confers a more durable protection against re-infection (\u201cnatural immunity\u201d). Prior to omicron, a previous covid infection provided 75% to 90% protection against re-infection for over a year, with only a slight decline (JAMA). Since omicron, a non-omicron infection 4 to 12 months earlier still provides a protection of 70% to 50% against re-infection with omicron, according to a study from Qatar (Lancet). According to a study from Denmark, which included more older people, protection decreased from 50% to 20% for a previous infection 6 months to 12+ months ago (Lancet).\n\nFurthermore, it has been shown that viral load and infectiousness are identical in unvaccinated and in vaccinated people (once infection occurs) (medRxiv). In addition, there is no evidence that vaccination reduces the risk of mild or moderate covid (once infection occurs), contrary to countless claims on Twitter (\u201cgrateful to be vaccinated and boosted\u201d). In other words, covid vaccination cannot prevent mild to moderate covid infection. There is also no evidence that vaccination reduces the risk of long covid in non-senior citizens (Nature).\n\nConcerning negative vaccine protection, there is one important exception: for about 7 to 10 days immediately after vaccination \u2013 especially after the first vaccination and apparently also after a later \u201cbooster vaccination\u201d \u2013 the risk of infection is indeed increased, possibly due to the known, transient immune suppression (lymphocytopenia) and increased exposure (\u201cpost-vaccination spike\u201d). This effect is important because it looks like in several countries, mass vaccination campaigns have indeed triggered new covid waves or amplified ongoing covid waves (if the vaccination campaign was running in parallel to such a wave, e.g. in Israel).\n\nIn sum, the fact that current covid vaccines provide only short-term, rapidly waning protection against infection and transmission means that covid vaccines do not contribute to infection control, neither at the individual level nor at the population level. However, contrary to claims by skeptics, there is also currently no evidence that vaccination increases infection rates (with the exception of the post-vaccination spike mentioned above). Rather, covid waves, similar to flu waves, oscillate at global and continental scales (e.g. between Western and Eastern Europe).\n\nThe fact that vaccine protection against infection and transmission is waning rapidly means that so-called \u201cvaccine passports\u201d are epidemiologically inappropriate or indeed counter\u00adproductive. For the same reason, vaccine mandates, even in healthcare workers, are medically unjustified. Based on Israeli data from early summer 2021, these facts had already been known before most countries even introduced such schemes.\n\nNevertheless, covid vaccines may provide protection against severe disease and death in high-risk groups. This question will be discussed in the next section.\n\nProtection against severe disease and death\n\nPrior to omicron, vaccine protection against severe disease in senior citizens (hospitalization, ICU and death) decreased from about 95% to about 60% within half a year (Lancet). It was this decrease that triggered the first booster campaigns, beginning in Israel in the summer of 2021. In younger people, the protection was somewhat more durable (about 80% after half a year) (Lancet).\n\nThe omicron variant has achieved substantial immune escape, and neutralization power of existing vaccines, which are still based on the spike protein of the original 2019 Wuhan variant, decreased by a factor of 10 to 50 compared to previous variants (SPR). Initially, it was uncertain if current vaccines would still provide any protection against omicron infection and severe disease.\n\nNevertheless, an analysis from Taiwan, which had almost no covid infections before experiencing a massive omicron wave in the spring of 2022, shows that in senior citizens (70+), a recent booster vaccination provides about 75% to 80% protection against covid death; in contrast, double vaccination (several months ago) provides only about 40% protection against death (TCDC).\n\nSimilarly, a British study on the risk of omicron hospitalization found that double vaccination months ago provided about 40% protection and a recent booster about 60% to 80% protection (Lancet). Clearly, the decisive point here is not the number of vaccinations, but rather the time since the last vaccination (as is the case with flu vaccination).\n\nA recent study from Qatar found higher values: two doses several months ago provided about 75% protection against severe disease or death, whereas a booster a few weeks ago provided about 90% protection. However, in the Qatar study, only 2% of participants were over 70 years of age, i.e. these results are not directly applicable to Western or Asian populations. (NEJM)\n\nThus, it looks like against omicron, vaccination several months ago reduces the risk of severe disease by about 50%, while recent vaccination may reduce the risk by about 75% (in senior citizens). It is possible that this continuing protection is due to a combination of limited levels of neutralizing antibodies, non-neutralizing antibodies, and the T-cell response (NIH).\n\nIn comparison, natural immunity from a previous infection (without any vaccination) provides more durable protection against severe disease upon reinfection. Prior to omicron, studies found a protection against hospitalization of about 90% for over a year with no declining trend (JAMA). Against omicron, the Qatar study, which included mostly young people, found a protection of 75% to 95% (NEJM). The important question of how strongly a previous (non-omicron) infection protects against severe omicron disease in senior citizens has not yet been answered.\n\nConcerning vaccine protection against severe disease, the decreasing immune response with age (so-called immunosenescence) is of importance. Most vaccine studies did not include very old citizens (80+) or nursing home residents, despite the fact that these are the groups most at risk of severe covid. Already in early 2021, studies showed that one third of people over 80 did not develop any neutralizing antibodies in response to covid vaccination, and that in nursing home residents, vaccine protection against infection reached at most 65%. (SPR)\n\nThis fact is important when analyzing country-level data, as will be done in the next section.\n\nUpdate: Official Dutch data shows that against severe disease caused by omicron, two vaccine doses (a year earlier) provide 0% protection, three doses 63%, and four doses 77%. New data from Qatar shows that even in people over 50, a previous infection provides 95% protection against severe disease upon reinfection with omicron for more than a year.\n\nCountry analyses\n\nVaccine study data reviewed above suggested that since omicron, protection against infection starts at 50% and drops to zero within a few months, whereas protection against severe disease and death in senior citizens starts at 75% and decreases to 50% within a few months. Are these values consistent with what has been observed in various Western and Asian countries?\n\nThe analysis of vaccine protection against omicron is complicated by the fact that in terms of hospitalizations and deaths, the omicron variant itself is about 60% to 80% milder compared to previous variants (Lancet). Furthermore, the mildness and very rapid spread of omicron means that 50% to 70% of PCR+ hospitalizations and deaths are just \u201cwith covid\u201d, not \u201cfrom covid\u201d, compared to about 10% to 20% during previous covid waves (SSI). Finally, the fact that many people already had a previous covid infection further adds to the complexity of calculating vaccine protection.\n\nEven excess mortality data can be difficult to interpret. This is because of pandemic and lockdown-related non-covid deaths (e.g. from cancer and heart disease); a return of strong flu waves in several countries; potential vaccine deaths; and seasonal factors (e.g. an out-of-season covid wave causes higher relative excess mortality than a seasonal wave).\n\nNevertheless, it is worth taking a look at real-world data from some notable countries.\n\nSwitzerland: Switzerland is an interesting case because it is the only country that has been using mainly the high-dosed Moderna vaccine (40% Moderna, 25% Pfizer, 30% unvaccinated). Swiss authorities provide detailed covid hospitalization and death data per age group and vaccination status (BAG, in English). Thus, one can see that during the two omicron waves in January and March 2022, double-vaccination provided still about 60% protection and recent booster vaccination provided about 90% to 80% protection against severe disease in senior citizens. Furthermore, Moderna provided consistently higher protection compared to Pfizer.\n\nHong Kong: Hong Kong is another fascinating case, as it had almost no infections for two years but then experienced a record-breaking omicron wave in February/March 2022 with very high covid death figures. At first glance this looked like total vaccine failure, but a closer inspection showed that vaccination rates in senior citizens were only 30% to 50%; 60% of deaths occurred in nursing homes; 90% of deaths were not yet double-vaccinated; and excess mortality was only about 65% of covid mortality (i.e. a third of PCR+ deaths weren\u2019t actually covid deaths).\n\nA comparison with Taiwan (80% booster rate in senior citizens (TCDC)) shows that the omicron wave in Taiwan reached about 40% of peak infections, but only 20% of peak deaths compared to Hong Kong (OWD). Thus, the case of Hong Kong does not contradict vaccine protection.\n\nAustralia: Due to strict border controls, Australia largely avoided pre-omicron infection waves, but the country has experienced several large omicron waves from January to June 2022. Compared to Hong Kong, total cases stand at 200%, but total deaths stand at only 30% (despite a much higher obesity rate in Australia); compared to the UK, total Australian PCR cases currently stand at 90%, but total PCR+ deaths stand at only 15% (per capita) (OWD). Thus, Australian data, too, appears to be consistent with continuing vaccine protection in senior citizens.\n\nIsrael: Covid vaccination pioneer Israel is the only European country that suffered higher excess mortality during the first omicron wave than during previous waves (EuroMomo). Nevertheless, official Israeli data shows that during the omicron wave, recently vaccinated senior citizens (3rd or 4th dose) had a 90% lower risk of severe disease, and senior citizens vaccinated a few months ago still had a 50% lower risk compared to unvaccinated citizens (IMH). The Israeli omicron wave was ten times higher than any previous wave in Israel, and it was higher even than the omicron wave in Hong Kong one month later (OWD). It is possible that the Israeli wave was so explosive because Israel once again vaccinated right into an ongoing wave.\n\nIn conclusion, one can see that real-world data from several countries are consistent with a short-term vaccine protection against severe disease in the range of 50% to 90%.\n\nNevertheless, even highly vaccinated populations continue to see non-trivial levels of covid disease. This is likely because of several factors: first, vaccination simply cannot limit transmission; second, vaccine protection against severe disease is typically only twofold to five-fold (50% to 80%) and not twenty-fold (95%); and third, omicron, although milder, has produced unprecedented infection rates (ten times higher than during previous waves).\n\nUpdated vaccines and antigenic priming\n\nWill updated omicron vaccines improve protection against omicron infection and disease? It looks like this is not going to be the case, as prior vaccination or prior infection has \u201cprimed\u201d the immune response to the pre-omicron virus or spike protein, and an updated vaccine can no longer significantly change the immune response (so-called antigenic priming) (Nature).\n\nModerna recently reported that its updated omicron vaccine increased neutralizing antibodies against omicron by a factor of 8, but a factor of 8 is very low (not even one order of magnitude), especially since the baseline was very low already, and it only applies to people without any prior infection, which by now is a small minority (Moderna).\n\nIt has also been shown that vaccinated people, once infected, often produce antibodies only against the spike (S) protein (as induced by the vaccine), but not against the nucleocapsid (N) protein of the virus, in contrast to unvaccinated people (NIH). The significance of this limited immune response in vaccinated people is not yet clear, as anti-N antibodies are not neutralizing antibodies, and children often do not produce anti-N antibodies, either (Nature). Anti-N antibodies could be beneficial, irrelevant, or even detrimental against future variants and infections.\n\nIn sum, it looks like SARS-CoV-2 antigenic priming now is a reality, both in vaccinated and in previously infected people, and current vaccine products are unlikely to significantly improve their effectiveness against future variants. On the other hand, there is still no evidence of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of covid infection or disease.\n\nRapidly declining effectiveness is not unique to covid vaccines; rather, it is a phenomenon already known from influenza vaccines (CID). Indeed, it looks like injecting specific antigens is simply not an ideal long-term strategy in the fight against quickly mutating respiratory viruses.\n\nDistorting vaccine protection\n\nVaccine protection can be exaggerated (by vaccine promoters) or downplayed (by vaccine skeptics).\n\nTypical methods to exaggerate vaccine protection are: 1) not counting infections shortly after vaccination (\u201cvaccinated\u201d vs. \u201cinjected\u201d); 2) counting patients with missing vaccination data as \u201cunvaccinated\u201d; 3) using outdated population data to exaggerate infections and hospitalizations in the unvaccinated; 4) quoting peak protection without acknowledging the rapid decline.\n\nTypical methods to downplay vaccine protection are: 1) Ignoring infection rates when comparing death rates; 2) confounding age groups; 3) comparing vaccinated to recovered people instead of unexposed people (\u201cnegative protection\u201d); 4) not distinguishing between with/from covid (especially since omicron).\n\nVaccine skeptics have correctly pointed out that in addition to relative effectiveness, one should also consider absolute effectiveness, which strongly depends on age. For instance, a 90% relative effectiveness translates into an absolute reduction of pre-omicron covid lethality from 1% to 0.1% (i.e. \u20130.9%) in senior citizens (outside of nursing homes) and from 0.05% to 0.005% in 45-year-old people (i.e. \u20130.045%) (SPR).\n\nVaccine injuries\n\nWhile the current review has focused on vaccine protection only, it should be recalled that covid vaccines are first-generation investigational vaccines with controversial short-term safety data, especially in young people, and still unknown long-term safety data.\n\nIndeed, in several countries authorization of some covid vaccine brands has already been denied, withdrawn, or limited to certain age groups due to significant safety signals. Serious vaccine adverse events include cardiovascular, neurological and immunological conditions. Additional booster vaccinations could further increase covid vaccine adverse events.\n\nRead more: Covid Vaccine Adverse Events: An Overview (SPR)\n\nConclusion\n\nBoth vaccine study data and real-world data reviewed above suggest that since omicron, vaccine protection against infection starts at 50% and drops to zero within a few months, whereas protection against severe disease and death in senior citizens starts at 75% and decreases to 50% within a few months.\n\nFurthermore, there is no difference in viral load and infectiousness between vaccinated and unvaccinated people; no evidence that vaccination reduces the risk of mild or moderate covid; and no evidence that vaccination reduces the risk of long covid in non-senior citizens. Prior covid infection continues to provide a more durable protection against reinfection.\n\nThus, while the risk/benefit ratio may still be positive in senior citizens and other risk groups (based on current evidence), this does not appear to be the case in healthy young adults and children. Danish professor in global health and vaccine expert, Dr. Christine Stabell-Benn, recently stated that she \u201cwouldn\u2019t recommend vaccination of anybody under 50 years of age.\u201d\n\nFinally, both \u201cvaccine passports\u201d and vaccine mandates, even for healthcare workers, have no medical or epidemiological justification and should be abandoned.\n\nYou have been reading: How effective are covid vaccines, really?\n\nAn analysis by Swiss Policy Research.\n\nFigures\n\n1) Taiwan: Vaccine protection against death during the omicron wave\n\n2) Pre-omicron vaccine protection against infection and severe covid (Sweden)\n\n3) Switzerland: Vaccine protection against hospitalization (70-79)\n\n4) Qatar (only 2% over 70): Previous infection and vaccination against omicron infection\n\n5) Same viral load in vaccinated and unvaccinated people (delta)\n\n\n\nSee also\n\nShare on: Twitter / Facebook / Telegram",

Yet this is only true if seen from a public health perspective. If seen from a technological and strategic perspective, the response may be described as an unprecedented success.\n\nWithin months of the WHO pandemic declaration in March 2020, PCR genetic tests became widely available, Apple and Google inserted contact tracing interfaces into the operating systems of billions of mobile phones, and numerous governments had developed contact tracing apps. Within less than a year, novel \u201cprogrammable\u201d mRNA vaccines became available internationally. And in March 2021, Israel was the first country to introduce a digital vaccination certificate (\u201cGreen Pass\u201d), followed by almost every other country in the world, including no-lockdown Sweden. Throughout this time, digital technologies were leveraged to manage remote work, remote learning and lockdowns, enforced in some places by the use of modern police drones and robotic dogs.\n\nNone of these innovations worked to contain or stop the pandemic, and none of them had been recommended by existing pandemic guidelines. Yet most of these policies were recommended by billionaire-funded organizations such as CEPI and GAVI, and many of them were publicly announced in March 2020 by the \u201cworld\u2019s most powerful doctor\u201d (Politico), Bill Gates, a major sponsor of the World Health Organization and a leading investor in mRNA vaccine technology.\n\nFurthermore, most of these innovations tie in neatly with other strategic initiatives, such as the WEF-linked ID2020 digital identity program, or they might be repurposed later on in the context of \u201cclimate change policy\u201d, \u201cterrorism prevention\u201d, or Chinese-style \u201csocial credit\u201d population control systems. In this regard, Israeli military historian and \u201cWEF philosopher\u201d, Yuval Harari, argued already in October 2020 that \u201cCovid is critical, because this is what convinces people to accept, to legitimize total biometric surveillance.\u201d\n\nIt is also noteworthy that while lockdowns, face masks and covid vaccines totally failed to stop coronavirus transmission, the false idea that they could stop transmission was crucial to justifying the introduction of QR-based digital vaccination certificates in the first place. The EU recently decided to extend the legal basis of these certificates for another year, while the US is about to fire 60,000 unvaccinated National Guard and reserve soldiers. In February, the WHO tasked Deutsche Telekom with building a global QR-based vaccine passport system.\n\nRead more: Did CEPI\u2019s bio-spooks lock down the West? (TCW) and Cock-up or Conspiracy? Understanding COVID-19 as a \u2018Structural Deep Event\u2019 (Dr. Piers Robinson)\n\nThe Dubious SARS/MERS \u201cDeath Rate\u201d\n\nA quite important yet mostly overlooked aspect of covid fearmongering was the comparison of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS and MERS. Specifically, the media and many scientists repeatedly stated that SARS had a \u201cdeath rate\u201d of 10% and MERS had a \u201cdeath rate\u201d of 35%, which made it seemingly reasonable to assume that SARS-CoV-2, a SARS-like coronavirus, might also have a \u201cdeath rate\u201d of at least several percent and might kill hundreds of millions of people, or even a third of mankind.\n\nYet a quick review of these \u201cdeath rates\u201d shows that these are not, of course, infection fatality rates, but case fatality rates, and the \u201ccases\u201d were not just any cases, but mostly patients hospitalized with a severe case of SARS or MERS. This is because during both the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003 and the MERS outbreak in 2012-2015, there was not yet any PCR mass testing available, and only severe cases were tested at all.\n\nThus, it is quite likely that the original SARS and MERS outbreaks were in fact larger than recorded, and the SARS and MERS infection fatality rates in the general population were much lower, perhaps only a fraction of one percent, similar to the infection fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIronically, if the recent pandemic had been caused by an aggressive influenza virus instead of a coronavirus, the actual death rate, especially in young people, could have been much higher.\n\nSee also: Covid fatality rates (SPR)\n\nChina and Zero Covid\n\nChina is the last country on Earth to still pursue a hopeless \u201czero covid\u201d policy, and Chinese authorities continue to impose devastating lockdowns on major cities such as Shanghai and Beijing. Various theories have been proposed as to why China would follow such a seemingly irrational and destructive policy, including \u201cChina is deceiving the West\u201d, \u201cChina is putting health over profits\u201d, or \u201cChina deliberately disrupts Western supply chains\u201d.\n\nYet most likely, the Chinese government simply doesn\u2019t want to admit defeat against coronavirus. Furthermore, the fact that the US suffered one million covid deaths and India suffered three to five million covid deaths, while China until 2022 had suffered very few covid deaths, is seen as confirmation that China is in fact a superior civilization.\n\nThe Chinese government is also perhaps the most technocratic government in the world, and they are the only government that has even tried to preempt or disrupt aerosol transmission, which comes at an enormous economic and social cost. Finally, the Chinese government likely sees covid as an opportunity to further enhance its QR-based population control scheme.\n\nRemarkably, though, Beijing city authorities recently had to withdraw a planned vaccination mandate for some public venues after massive online protest by citizens.\n\nTo get a glimpse of the Chinese \u201czero covid\u201d reality, see the eye-opening Twitter video channel of \u201cSongpinganq\u201d (16+, contains disturbing footage). To learn more about the Chinese digital \u201csocial credit\u201d system, see this 5-minute report by France24.\n\nSee also: Did China stage the early covid videos? (SPR)\n\nCoronavirus Origins\n\nAs previously discussed, the novel coronavirus almost certainly emerged out of US-Chinese virological research. Moreover, the current omicron variant, which features two dozen immune-evasive spike mutations \u201ccopied from scientific publications\u201d, most likely emerged from pan-coronavirus vaccine research (presumably in a South African lab).\n\nThus, within the span of just three years, the world has likely seen not one, but two man-made virus pandemics. After the delta variant, several countries with covid infection rates above 70% had achieved a kind of \u201cherd immunity\u201d and had seen the return of influenza viruses (e.g. India, Brazil and Sweden); yet the immune-evasive (but milder) omicron variant has undone this achievement and has launched several massive new waves within just a few months.\n\nMost recently, the Chair of the Lancet Covid Commission, US professor Jeffrey Sachs, stated that he is \u201cpretty convinced [SARS-CoV-2] came out of US lab biotechnology, not out of nature\u201d and that this is \u201cnot being investigated, not in the United States and not anywhere, for real reasons\u2026 I believe they do not want to look under the rug too much.\u201d Professor Sachs also wrote an in-depth article and a scientific paper on the likely origins of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nA lab-related virus origin either in China or in the US, and either accidental or deliberate \u2013 all of these possibilities remain entirely plausible. In particular, a deliberate release does not even have to be a \u201cconspiracy\u201d, as any single researcher involved in this type of research could decide to release such a pathogen, as the US FBI (falsely) claimed in the case of the 2001 anthrax letters.\n\nSee also: On the Origins of SARS-CoV-2 (SPR)\n\nWhy Face Masks Have Failed\n\nIt has been known for decades that face masks don\u2019t work against respiratory virus epidemics, and the current coronavirus pandemic has once again confirmed this reality. Even N95/FFP2 masks have had no impact on infection rates in the general population, neither in Germany and Austria, nor in Taiwan and South Korea (which saw record infection rates in recent months).\n\nA recent Australian study, published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, has finally shown why face masks fail so badly. The experimental study for the first time used actual virus aerosols (of a virus harmless to humans) and actual human participants (not puppet heads) in an aerosol chamber.\n\nThe study found that neither face masks nor unfitted N95 masks had any measurable effect on virus loads in the nostrils of study participants (fig. 2B); only fit-tested N95 masks significantly and strongly reduced virus loads in nostrils, as they prevent aerosols from bypassing the mask.\n\nThis result is fully consistent with real-world observations that face masks and N95 masks worn by the general population are useless, whereas fit-tested N95 masks worn by medical professionals can make a real difference \u2013 although during an epidemic, medical professionals may then get infected at home or during social activities, as masks cannot be worn 24/7.\n\nSee also: The Face Mask Folly in Retrospect (SPR)\n\nThe Dark Side of Covid Vaccine Trials\n\nHow sincere were the original covid vaccine trials?\n\nIt was already known that the Russian Sputnik vaccine trial most likely forged its results (to achieve an efficacy at least as high as Western mRNA vaccines). It was also known that both AstraZeneca and Johnson&Johnson declared some severe adverse events that were likely related to the vaccine \u2013 a case of transverse myelitis and a case of cerebral sinus venous thrombosis \u2013 as being \u201cunrelated\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, it was known that the Pfizer vaccine trial had strangely excluded, without explanation, five times more people from the vaccine group than from the control group.\n\nPfizer and the US FDA attempted to hide the original Pfizer vaccine trial documents for a full 75 years, but a determined New York lawyer forced them to immediately release the documents on a monthly basis. While almost totally ignored by traditional media, many of these documents have since been analyzed by independent investigators who coordinate themselves on Twitter.\n\nTheir preliminary results indicate that Pfizer and its subcontractors (which ran the trial sites) really may have suppressed some serious vaccine adverse events (by excluding the participants or by miscategorizing the events) and may have exaggerated vaccine efficacy to some extent (by not testing symptomatic participants or by simply excluding positive participants).\n\nThere have also been claims that hidden anti-N antibody data showed that the Pfizer vaccine actually had zero efficacy, but this was not the case: most of these infections occurred prior to the second vaccine dose or shortly thereafter.\n\nTo learn more about the dark side of the Pfizer vaccine trial, take a look at the following articles:\n\nThe covid vaccines may have saved a few million lives in 2021, mainly by mitigating the alpha and delta waves in Europe, the United States and elsewhere (though not \u201c20 million lives\u201d as recently claimed by some Gates-funded researchers). But vaccine protection even against severe disease is rapidly waning: the Netherlands recently reported 75% protection after four doses weeks ago, 60% protection after three doses months ago, and 0% protection after two doses a year ago.\n\nOverall, covid vaccines may yet win a Nobel Prize in Medicine, or turn out to be the biggest medical scandal in recent history, or perhaps both. At any rate, the vaccination of people not at risk of severe acute covid was almost certainly a mistake, and in some cases a crime.\n\nSee also: Covid Vaccine Adverse Events (SPR)\n\nCovid Drugs I: The Failure of Antivirals\n\nTo treat covid, pharmaceutical companies mostly focused on the development of novel and rather expensive antiviral drugs. Yet all of these drugs, sold for billions of dollars to desperate health authorities, ultimately failed.\n\nAntiviral drugs that were given only to hospitalized patients with severe covid had to fail almost by definition, as most of these patients had already progressed to the post-viral, hyper-inflammatory phase of covid. This was the case of convalescent plasma therapy and Gilead\u2019s highly expensive yet toxic and totally ineffective Remdesivir.\n\nMonoclonal antibodies, which were given to high-risk outpatients as quickly as possible, initially proved effective, but they lost the battle against new coronavirus mutations.\n\nMerck\u2019s Molnupiravir was a non-starter, both ineffective against most variants and dangerously mutagenic (\u201cavoid unprotected sex for 30 days after treatment\u201d).\n\nPfizer\u2019s Paxlovid, which directly inhibits the main coronavirus replication enzyme, looked most promising. Yet it soon turned out that it was effective only in unvaccinated high-risk patients, not in standard-risk patients or in vaccinated high-risk patients. Moreover, up to half of all patients experienced a \u201ccovid rebound\u201d immediately after discontinuing the drug; the side effect profile was worse than expected (\u201cPaxlovid mouth\u201d); and SARS-CoV-2 quickly started developing Paxlovid-resistant mutations. Another expensive bummer.\n\nSPR had warned in advance that Remdesivir was a fraud, Molnupiravir was outright dangerous, and Paxlovid might lead to rapid reinfections. The reality is that antiviral drugs may simply not be the ideal choice against a ubiquitous and fast-mutating respiratory virus.\n\nCovid Drugs II: Ivermectin, HCQ, and more\n\nGiven the many issues with antiviral drugs, another approach to tackle covid is to try to improve the immune response and to mitigate the health impact of the virus.\n\nAt the population level, this could be done by reducing obesity rates, since obesity has been shown to be linked to an ineffective and even destructive immune response. It could also be done by removing any deficiencies in vitamins and minerals (e.g. vitamin D and zinc).\n\nTwo of the most controversial covid treatments during the pandemic have been Nobel Prize-winning anti-parasitic drug ivermectin and history-making anti-malaria drug HCQ. Most trials of these and other off-patent drugs were rather pointless, involving low-risk participants, late administration, or unrealistic endpoints (e.g. infections or symptom duration instead of disease progression).\n\nNevertheless, concerning ivermectin, a yet unpublished, updated meta-analysis of non-fraudulent trials indicates that ivermectin is indeed about 30% effective at reducing severe and fatal covid. Furthermore, the lead investigator of the TOGETHER trial acknowledged in a leaked email that \u201cthere is a clear signal that ivermectin works in COVID patients\u201d. The renowned French Institute Pasteur previously found a \u201cmore favorable clinical presentation\u201d in a detailed coronavirus animal study.\n\nThe apparent usefulness of ivermectin is most likely not due to an anti-viral effect, but due to the known immuno-modulatory and anti-asthma effects. This would also explain why Merck, in early 2021, claimed ivermectin was \u201cnot effective\u201d: if anything, they only looked into anti-viral activity.\n\nConcerning HCQ, an updated retrospective study from the group of French professor Didier Raoult found a 30% effectiveness against death in hospitalized patients, and a similar or higher effectiveness in outpatients. A yet-to-be-published meta-analysis also found a 30% effectiveness against hospitalization and death in high-risk outpatients.\n\nIn the case of HCQ, the apparent usefulness is most likely not due to an anti-viral effect, either, but instead due to the known anti-coagulation and anti-autoimmune effects.\n\nIn sum, it looks like some of these medications could really have been beneficial in reducing the risk of severe covid, but they clearly did not \u201ccrush the curve\u201d anywhere.\n\nSee also: On the treatment of covid (SPR)\n\nAsymptomatic Transmission: A Myth?\n\nMany authorities tried to use the idea of \u201casymptomatic transmission\u201d to justify mask mandates and lockdowns, while many skeptics pushed back by arguing that \u201casymptomatic transmission\u201d was a myth. In truth, asymptomatic and especially pre-symptomatic transmission are real and well-known from influenza and other viruses, but due to aerosol transmission, face masks and other restrictions still don\u2019t work.\n\nSome recent press reports claimed that a new meta-study showed \u201casymptomatic transmission\u201d was very rare, but the meta-study in fact showed the opposite: it found that pre-symptomatic transmission was just as likely as symptomatic transmission (risk ratio 1.00) and that it accounted for 30% to 50% of all transmission. Only people that remain fully asymptomatic throughout their infection are less likely to infect others (risk ratio 0.32), likely because of a lower viral load.\n\nIndeed, without insidious pre-symptomatic aerosol transmission \u2013 which doesn\u2019t require any \u201cdroplets\u201d produced by coughing or sneezing \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic would probably not have been possible. Given that aerosol transmission occurs almost only indoors and face masks are ineffective against aerosols, public health policy should likely focus on improving indoor air quality, especially in important public venues.\n\nSee also: Pre-symptomatic transmission is very real (SPR)\n\nLong Covid: Another Myth?\n\nSimilar to the case of \u201casymptomatic transmission\u201d, many health authorities tried to use the risk of \u201clong covid\u201d to justify mask mandates or vaccination mandates even for young people, while many skeptics tried to push back by arguing that \u201clong covid\u201d was a myth or a psychological condition.\n\nYet ever since the summer of 2020, the clinical reality of long covid has been obvious, and it has also been clear that long covid can seriously impact the quality of life and performance even of previously healthy young people who had only seemingly mild covid.\n\nThe pathology of long covid isn\u2019t a total mystery anymore, either. First, there are patients who do not (fully) recover their sense of taste or smell. Second, there are patients who show respiratory problems due to asthma-like conditions, gas exchange abnormalities, or lung perfusion (blood flow) issues (presumably due to endothelial damage). Third, there are patients who develop new-onset neurological or auto-immune conditions that are often difficult to diagnose.\n\nOn the other hand, heart inflammation is not generally a covid or long covid risk, but rather a covid vaccination risk, especially in young males.\n\nStudies that claim \u201clong covid\u201d is a myth typically make one of three mistakes: first, they compare non-specific symptoms unrelated to covid and long covid; second, they rely on unreliable antibody data; or third, they assume that if a general practitioner cannot identify a cause, no cause exists.\n\nIn this regard, a study recently published in Lancet eBioMedicine found that almost 50% of long covid patients that showed no SARS-CoV-2 antibodies did show a SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell response (i.e. they had been infected). It is also known that some widely used antibody tests (e.g. Abbott) have a sensitivity of just 20% one year after mild infection.\n\nThe real questions concerning long covid are rather these: how many people are affected, how severe are these cases, what is the recovery rate, do reinfections increase the risk of long covid or exacerbate long covid, and are there any treatments?\n\nFor instance, a recent German insurance study found that among covid patients in 2020, 1% to 5% received a medical long covid diagnosis in 2021; the average long covid sick leave from work in 2021 was 90 days even in non-hospitalized patients, and 105 days overall.\n\nDenying long covid is about as reasonable as denying vaccine injuries. It is part of the complex reality of this pandemic, unfortunately, even though the condition has indeed in some cases been abused for fearmongering and political ends.\n\nRead more: Post-Acute Covid and Long Covid (SPR)\n\nChildren: Little Heroes or Big Losers?\n\nA comprehensive Icelandic study recently confirmed once more that covid remained asymptomatic or mild in almost all children, and that prior to omicron, almost 90% of infections in children occurred outside of school, mostly at home, and mostly from adults to children, not the other way around (omicron removed this difference to some extent).\n\nOn the other hand, UNESCO found that over 150 million children missed more than half a year of in-person schooling (and up to two years in some countries), which caused reading and math abilities to decline substantially, especially in developing countries. According to the World Bank, the pandemic response has caused \u201cthe worst educational crisis for a century, and certainly since the world wars.\u201d\n\nChildren should have been the little invincible heroes of this pandemic, but unfortunately in many countries they have been turned into perhaps the biggest losers. If there is one lesson to be learned from this pandemic, it is to never repeat this mistake.\n\nSee also: Covid and Kids: The Evidence.

        "Just a year ago if you asked anyone if they would like an experimental vaccine that has only been in trials for a few months, has no significant safety data, negligible efficacy data and 80% of test subjects had moderate to high adverse effects, to help protect against a disease which effects only a small fraction of society, specifically the old and vulnerable, all but the clinically insane would have told you where to go.\n\nHow times have changed. So what happened?\n\nThe Year of Fear\n\nFear is an important human response, it is an emotion with one goal in mind, saving your ass.\n\nFear facilitates adaptation and constitutes a survival and defense mechanism that developed so that individuals could respond to adverse situations quickly and efficiently. In that sense, fear is a normal and beneficial emotion, not just for individual survival but also for the entire human species. Fear is considered \u201cnormal\u201d when its intensity corresponds to the seriousness of the threat. In other words, the object of fear has characteristics that could threaten a person\u2019s life. \u2013 Exploring Your Mind[1]\n\nBut sadly, as with all human emotions, it can be easily exploited.\n\n2020 saw the greatest exploitation of the human fear emotion the World has ever seen. From the early days in Wuhan where we saw people dropping to the floor in pools of blood, to the piles of bodies outside of hospitals and what about those insane prediction models coming out of the Imperial College!\n\nThe facts surrounding the events are unimportant, or at least they have been to the Government and media. What is important is that it generates fear in the population.\n\nFear has been the main driver of this pandemic, it has been the very lifeblood of this pandemic. The actual facts just wouldn\u2019t have been enough to ensure compliance. We needed all-out psychological warfare to keep this baby going.\n\nOver the past year we have seen people become fearful of the very environment they live in and the people that inhabit it, all thanks to the response to this pandemic.\n\nPeople are so scared of the virus that they would choose to neglect someone in need, even a family member, because their fear overshadowed their love.\n\nOur Lord & Saviour, the Vaccine\n\nWith running commentary all the way back from the beginning about how the only way out of this pandemic was with \u2018a vaccine\u2019, is it any wonder this COVID-19 vaccine has developed something of god-like status?\n\nFirst of all, we were told it was our saviour, our only hope. But then we were left hanging with comments from many experts saying \u201cA vaccine before the end of 2021 is unlikely\u201d.\n\nThe vaccine-carrot has been just off in the distance, out of reach, every step of the way. But then, hallelujah, we were seeing promise of a vaccine by Christmas!\n\nBy the New Year we had a choice, we had the Pfizer vaccine or the Moderna Vaccine. People had a choice, people could drool over the one they thought was the best. But hang on, you might have to wait?!\n\nWait in Line\n\nHow exciting it must be to get that letter through the post, much like Charlie receiving his golden ticket to Wonker\u2019s Chocolate factory, the feeling I\u2019m sure is something else. \u2018I was chosen, it\u2019s my turn and I beat you to it!\u2019\n\nBrilliant indeed. How else were they going to convince an entire nation to be the phase three clinical trials of a new experimental vaccine using new technology with absolutely no long-term studies, in fact nothing exceeding just a few months?\n\nMy hat goes off to them. They did good.\n\nWait, there are shortages, we might have to delay the second dose to ensure others can get their first dose?!\n\n\u2026.chief executive of NHS England, said there is a global \u201csupply shortage\u201d of the vaccines, as manufacturers struggle to keep up with demand. \u2013 Sky News[2]\n\nThis type of narrative is all we have heard since even before the vaccines were being manufactured on mass. Leaders around the World were fighting over who had how many, and when \u2013 it has been like watching a soap opera, with a terrible cast and an equally terrible script.\n\nBut it works. This sense of missing out, or FOMO(fear of missing out) really does do the trick regarding demand. When people fear they might be unable to have something offered, they want it even more \u2013 it\u2019s human instinct.\n\nAnd this, my friends, is how you get an entire population scrabbling over an experimental vaccine.\n\nStay Informed\n\nAll I ask of anyone, is that they do their own research and due diligence, your initial thoughts maybe that this decision is a no-brainer \u2013 \u2018of course I\u2019ll have the vaccine\u2019. But this lack of thought is the result of the biased information you have been subjected too. It really isn\u2019t as simple as that.\n\nPeople are dying from the vaccine, people are getting severely injured from the vaccine, as they do with all vaccines. The difference this time is that we do not know what we are dealing with, this time we have literally just a few months of trial data to rely on (all of which is still unreleased by the pharmaceutical companies, so much for their pledge for transparency[3]).\n\nExperts are surprised by the high frequency of adverse effects, countries like Norway have experienced dozens of deaths following vaccination of their elderly. And while health officials and the media may shrug all these issues off as \u2018coincidence\u2019, can we really be sure they are?\n\nHere is the real question you need to ask yourself:\n\nWhat is the risk to benefit ratio?\n\nIf you are under 75 and relatively healthy, there is no point in taking this vaccine, it can offer you nothing your immune system can do better.\n\nIf you are over 75, and/or have health issues, do you think your immune system is ready for the vaccine? Baring in mind the high rate of adverse effects from the shot.\n\nI understand it\u2019s a tough decision for many, the vaccine may feel like an antidote for the perpetual fear you have been going through \u2013 but just know this, all the data on mortality over the past year shows nothing particularly significant is occurring.\n\nExcess deaths are up marginally, but we\u2019ve had worse in the past decade.\n\nEverything we hear about the hospitals being overrun, bodies piling up in the streets \u2013 it\u2019s all due to the reaction and not the problem.\n\nIf you put 40+% of your perfectly healthy medical staff into self-isolation due to a testing system that has been proven to be flawed, you can expect to see hospitals fall into chaos.\n\nIf you reduce your hospital beds every year by 10% for decades (as they have been here in the UK), then you can expect trouble sooner or later.\n\nIf you have more 85 and above year olds than ever before in the population, then isolate them, throw a few COVID infected patients in with them \u2013 reduce the number of people to look after them \u2013 Well, expect a lot of them to die.\n\nThere are a million and one reasons why the excess deaths are marginally higher over the past 12 months, and all of them have very little to do with a deadly virus.",
        "What is the best way to convince the general public into taking an experimental vaccine which has limited safety and efficacy trials?\n\nOf course, you use actors and other performance artists to convince them. Most people do not want the science or data to hand when making important decisions like this, but give them a familiar face from the little box in the room, telling them to be good little girls and boys and hey presto, informed consent complete!\n\nBefore I get into these so-called celebrities who have sold their souls to the devil, I\u2019d like to point out the fact that the NHS & the British media warned the public that this was exactly how they were going to convince the public into being human guinea pigs back in November of 2020:\n\nNHS bosses plan to enlist celebrities and \u201cinfluencers\u201d with big social media followings in a major campaign to persuade people to have a Covid vaccine amid fears of low take-up. Ministers and NHS England are drawing up a list of \u201cvery sensible\u201d famous faces in the hope that their advice to get immunised would be widely trusted, the Guardian has learned. \u2013 The Guardian[1]\n\nThis tactic however is nothing new, some of you may remember singer and full-time drug addict Elvis Presley taking the Polio Vaccine on national television in 1956, which led to a staggering 90% vaccine uptake in no time![2]\n\nOne can only assume that finding \u2018very sensible\u2019 celebrities willing to place the general population into a position of potential harm proved harder than expected.\n\nFirst up, Elton John:",
        "The ongoing so-called \u2018pandemic\u2019 has hit everyone hard, no one has escaped the grip of the tyrannical reaction from Governments around the World, but there is a group of the population which is suffering in silence, in plain view, this group are the future of human society and parents are unknowingly through their own ignorance, destroying them both physically and mentally.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the Children.\n\nAnother Brick in The Wall\n\nWitnessing children going to school was a shocking sight to behold, as the bused loaded with fully masked children parked up outside the school gates, children were ushered off the bus by a team of teachers who ensured social distancing was achieved as the children made their way to their new pandemic modified classrooms.\n\nWith all over 12-year-olds now expected to wear Face Masks throughout the day, social distancing maintained where possible and the constant reminder of the big bad scary COVID-19 lurking around every corner; School is quite the little house of horrors.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t end there. Parents are shamefully allowing their children, and likely encouraging them either directly or indirectly to wear face masks out in public, when shopping or at the park.\n\nVirtue Signalling\n\nWhile shopping the other day at my local supermarket, I witnessed multiple parents with children as young as 5 fully masked, in one case they had matching pink face masks. Ugggh!\n\nUsing your children as part of your ridiculous virtue signalling games is disgusting.\n\nUnder any other circumstances, this unquestionably would be considered as \u2018Child Abuse\u2019. Covering a child\u2019s airways and thus restricting airflow to the child\u2019s lungs is clearly an issue. Where are those lovely child-snatchers over at social services now?\n\nBut the physical abuse is just a very small part of the problem. It is the ongoing psychological abuse on children that really is at a scale never witnessed before.\n\nFear is the Mind Killer\n\nFor over a year, children have been placed in a perpetual state of fear, the fear of the killer bug, the fear for their own lives, but even more so, the fear of killing those they love \u2013 their parents, their grandparents.\n\n\u201cStay Safe!\u201d. When people I deal with say this to me in closing our conversation I want to scream.\n\nIt\u2019s everywhere, from billboards to motorway information displays. Everywhere I go, \u201cStay Safe\u201d, \u201cStay Safe!\u201d, \u201cStay Safe!\u201d. Please enough, if it makes me feel like I\u2019m loosing my sanity, god only knows how young children are feeling right now.\n\nFilthy Little Rats!\n\nWe live in unprecedented times, a time where social division is promoted and human contact is condemned.\n\nFor the first time in history, a child is now made to feel guilty for cuddling up to their parents, a time when a hug is needed more than ever.\n\nBritons should not hug their children even once they\u2019ve been vaccinated, an expert has stressed \u2013 The Evening Standard[1]\n\nAnd keep away from your much loved Grandparents, don\u2019t touch them \u2013 you might kill them:\n\nGrandparents who have received the Covid vaccine should not yet hug their families, a professor has warned, amid fears that those who have had the jab will abandon the lockdown rules. \u2013 The Telegraph[2]\n\n\u201cKeep those filthy little child hands to yourself, you are a potentially deadly weapon and you wouldn\u2019t want to kill your own loved ones, would you? Stay Safe!\u201d\n\nMental Abuse\n\nI cannot begin to imagine how all this feels for children right now, but new data is emerging and it doesn\u2019t look pretty.\n\nDr. Richard Delorme heads the psychiatric department at one of the largest children\u2019s hospitals in France and what he is seeing is devastating:\n\n\u201cWe are very surprised by the intensity of the desire to die among children who may be 12 or 13 years old,\u201d Delorme said. \u201cWe sometimes have children of 9 who already want to die. And it\u2019s not simply aprovocation or a blackmail via suicide. It is a genuine wish to end their lives.\u201d \u2013AP News[3]\n\nDepression in children grew exponentially just through the UK\u2019s first lockdown:\n\n\u201cTo give an indication of how large this effect is, imagine ranking the children into 100 \u2018centiles\u2019 depending on their scores,\u201d explained Dr Duncan Astle from the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit and senior author of the study. \u201cA child in the 50th centile would be exactly at the middle of the distribution. But a child at this position before the pandemic, could expect to be at the equivalent of the 77th centile during the lockdown. \u201cPut differently, if you randomly selected a child from the sample there is a 70% chance that their depression symptoms were worse during lockdown than before the pandemic.\u201d \u2013 University of Cambridge[4]\n\nThat was the observation of children just after a few months of the pandemic. What are the effects a year on?\n\nIgnorance is Bliss\n\nIn many cases parents play a large part of this abuse, by participating in this pandemic fiasco, reinforcing the lies and fears presented by the Government and media, they are validating fear and confusion in their children.\n\nIt\u2019s disgusting and unforgiveable. There is no excuse for lack of research and critical thinking, particularly when this neglect to one\u2019s own knowledge results in the abuse of your own children.\n\nParents who pander to these false fears in front of their children should be shamed, they should be held accountable. Not by Government, they\u2019ve done quite enough damage, but by society.\n\nGood is Bad; Black is White\n\nBut in this topsy-turvy World it is I that is shamed; shamed for taking my children out shopping; shamed for failing to sanitize my children\u2019s hands and my own at every entry and exit point; failure to wear a mask or prevent my children from running around like lunatics as if there was nothing to fear.\n\nWe are the lepers, the freaks, the odd ones out. We who have ensured our children remain free, happy and emotionally satisfied both mentally and physically. We are the parents of concern, simply for loving our children first and foremost.\n\nTake this piece from the teen propaganda publication Teen Vogue entitled \u2018Young People on Holiday Risks With Parents Who Ignore COVID-19 Restrictions'[5] for example:\n\nSelena\u2019s mom hasn\u2019t tempered her activities because of COVID-19restrictions \u2014 she\u2019s still going on out-of-town trips and gambling in casinos. Selena\u2019s aunt, a nurse, doesn\u2019t wear her mask dependably. She says her mother\u2019s side of the family doesn\u2019t know anyone who has gotten sick or died from COVID, so it\u2019s easy for them to pretend it isn\u2019t real. Plus, she says, they don\u2019t listen to reliable news sources \u2014 \u201csome of them still claim that the election was a fraud, so it\u2019s one of those situations.\u201d \u2013 Teen Vogue[5]\n\nThis shameful piece of propaganda continues to vilify the parents while validating and indeed amplifying children\u2019s fears using unconfirmed science:\n\nBut there are now reports of people contracting the virus twice, suggesting immunity may not last. Teen Vogue[5]\n\nIt is true that there are cases of people contracting the virus twice, but we are talking about a small handful of cases from the millions that have contracted the virus. The article intentionally fails to elaborate on this topic, they simply make the statement that you can catch it twice, and leave it there.\n\nThis article is just one of thousands designed to turn children against their parents. Its psychological warfare against your children, you and the family unit as a whole.\n\nPlease, I urge you, no matter what your views on the pandemic are, please put your children first, second and third. There is nothing more important in this world than our children, they are our future, our legacy.\n\nPlease leave your comments below.",

        "(Natural News) The Spanish government sprayed lethal chemtrails on its citizens under a United Nations program to fight the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) barely a month after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global pandemic.\n\nThe chemtrail operation was actually authorized by a royal decree on March 14, 2020, just three days after the official announcement of the pandemic. The Boletin Oficial del Estado (BOE) \u2013 Spain\u2019s official state gazette \u2013 published the order the following day and was acknowledged by Madrid on April 16, 2020.\n\nThe UN-backed project was done under the cover of the \u201cstate of emergency for the management of the health crisis situation caused by COVID-19.\u201d\n\nSpain\u2019s State Meteorological Agency (AEMET) took part in the biocide spraying operation. The entirety of Spain was locked down to stop the spread of COVID-19 \u2013 and to facilitate the aerial spraying operations. (Related: Spanish government admits to spraying chemtrails on citizens, at behest of the UN.)\n\nThe decree authorized all units under the Spanish Armed Forces, including military emergency units, to use biocide chemicals approved by the Ministry of Health (MOH) for disinfection in order to deal with the COVID-19 health crisis.\n\nIt also declared \u201ca state of emergency for the management of the health crisis situation caused by COVID-19, which includes a series of measures aimed at protecting the welfare, health and safety of citizens and the containment of the progression of the disease and strengthen the public health system.\u201d\n\nSalvador Illa, the Spanish health minister, was given the authority to \u201cdictate\u201d orders to the \u201cmilitary\u201d for the duration of the \u201chealth emergency.\u201d\n\nThe order explicitly called for the use of \u201caerial media\u201d and \u201caerial disinfection techniques\u201d to reach all surfaces quickly via techniques of nebulization, thermo nebulization and micro nebulization.\n\nSpain previously involved in a chemtrail scandal\n\nPrior to the April 2020 aerial spraying, Madrid had been involved in a chemtrail scandal as attested by former Member of the European Parliament (MEP) Ramon Tremosa i Balcells.\n\nThe MEP testified in Brussels back in May 2015 that four AEMET workers blew the whistle on chemtrails. According to the whistleblowers, planes were regularly spraying chemicals throughout the country.\n\n\u201cTremosa announced in the European Parliament that four workers from [AEMET] had confessed that Spain is being sprayed entirely from planes that spread lead dioxide, silver iodide and diatomite through the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nAccording to the MEP, the operation sought to ward off rains and allow temperatures to rise. This subsequently resulted to a summery environment for tourism and more favorable conditions for corporations in the agricultural sector growing their crops. In turn, the resulting aerial spraying to geo-engineer the climate is producing cold drops of great intensity.\n\nAreas located in southeastern Spain such as Murcia, Valencia and Almeria suffered the most \u2013 to the extent that not a drop of rain has fallen there in more than seven months. The chemtrails also gave rise to catastrophic \u201cgota fria\u201d storms. Worse, respiratory diseases among the population emerged since most of them inhale the lead dioxide and other toxic compounds sprayed by the aircraft.\n\nVisit ChemtrailsNews.com for more news related to deadly chemtrails on air.\n\nWatch the video that talks about Spain admitting to chemtrail spraying as part of a UN secret program.\n\nThis video is from the TNTVNews channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nThe COVID-19 extinction level event.\n\nToxic chemicals in the environment are making children dumber.\n\nTop 10 DRUG, CHEMICAL and TOXIN delivery devices used for population reduction and genocide.\n\nFive ways to clear the body of chemtrail toxins.\n\nSources include:\n\nGlobalResearch.ca\n\nPhilosophers-Stone.info\n\nBrighteon.com",

        "(Natural News) Abir Ballan has put together a 43-page thesis called \u201cThe WHO Review and Why It Matters to You\u201d that exposes the World Health Organization (WHO) as a highly corrupt political organization pushing tyranny in the name of \u201cpublic health.\u201d\n\nPublished on the Pandemics Data & Analytics (PANDA) website, the thesis directly challenges WHO\u2019s alleged authority as a leader in global public health. It reveals that almost nothing WHO does has anything to do with public health as pretty much all of it is politically driven.\n\n\u201cThis review empowers you with key information to help you assess the WHO\u2019s candidacy as an authoritative global public health organization,\u201d PANDA said. \u201cIt provides background information on public health and pandemic management principles as previously agreed upon by this branch of the United Nations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe PANDA analysis will allow you to evaluate the soundness of the WHO-recommended response to [Wuhan coronavirus] COVID-19 and monkeypox, and to determine how faithfully the WHO followed its own previously developed recommendations. It goes on to summarize the assumptions underlying their Covid-19 recommendations, followed by a summary of the final recommendations.\u201d\n\nWHO is supposed to protect medical freedom and support individual bodily autonomy\n\nWHO is supposed to follow the 10 Public Health Principles outlined in its official policies whenever dealing with a public health emergency. Instead, the United Nations arm scrapped them all when COVID-19 arrived.\n\nThe first principle, which deals with human dignity and personal freedoms, was pretty much a no-go as WHO supported lockdowns, business closures, masks and other forms of medical fascism. (Related: WHO has also been implicated in possibly building and releasing the coronavirus bioweapon.)\n\nThe second principle deals with health in a holistic way, addressing not only physical but also mental, spiritual and social wellbeing. Was any of this a consideration when WHO endorsed more than two years of absolute plandemic hell?\n\nThe third \u2013 and this one is really important \u2013 deals with the right to bodily autonomy. In essence, WHO is supposed to respect the right of every individual to choose his own path to health \u2013 meaning no mandates, period.\n\nFourthly, WHO is supposed to support only those health interventions that a person chooses individually. Building on the third principle, the fourth stresses once again that sovereignty and individual liberty is to be upheld at all costs.\n\n\u201cHealth professionals must obtain informed and voluntary consent from individuals before any medical intervention,\u201d reads the fifth point. \u201cInaccurate information, psychological manipulation and any form of coercion render consent invalid.\u201d\n\nThe sixth deals with medical information remaining private. For instance, nobody else has any right to know your vaccination status because it is none of their business.\n\nThe last four principles deal with closely evaluating the needs of a community based on the alleged threat; looking at the long-term implications of any new health policy; utilizing the input of individuals and communities in forming those policies; and only forming policies based on truth rather than politics.\n\nDid WHO follow any of these guidelines throughout the plandemic?

        "(Natural News) Steve Kirsch attempted to create a Google Surveys questionnaire about Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccines,\u201d only to have Google censor it.\n\nIt turns out that Google does not allow any Google Surveys to mention anything about covid, the jabs or associated adverse events. An email Kirsch received from Google explained that \u201cinformation related to certain medical topics,\u201d in this case the Fauci Flu, \u201care a non-starter.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this scenario,\u201d the email adds, \u201cwe must reserve the right to allow or not allow surveys with these topics at our sole discretion. Please remove this question to make it compliant.\u201d\n\nKirsch\u2019s first question \u2013 he only created two \u2013 and the one that Google is referring to, here, asks whether anyone in the household, including oneself, has ever had covid, is now unable to work because of a covid infection, or has died from covid.\n\nThis would seem to be a generally innocuous question, which makes Google\u2019s objection to it somewhat dubious. (Related: Google has been on a censorship spree for many years.)\n\nIn his second question, Kirsch asked if anyone in the household, including oneself, has taken the covid injection, had a diagnosis of myocarditis following injection, or died from a covid injection. Here is what Google had to say about this one:\n\n\u201cSurveys with questions including offensive, obscene, gruesome, shocking or distasteful content are not allowed to run.\u201d\n\nIs Google the government\u2019s Ministry of Truth?\n\nGoogle pretty much sent the same response to both of Kirsch\u2019s questions, mainly suggesting that they are inappropriate and not something that Google wants to allow on its platform.\n\nIn order to publish the survey, the tech giant explained, both of Kirsch\u2019s questions need to be removed \u2013 which means there is no survey left to publish.\n\nKirsch says that he and his team \u201cwere floored\u201d by the response, as all they are attempting to do is take the pulse of public health post-plandemic.\n\n\u201cClearly, they don\u2019t want anyone to know the truth,\u201d Kirsch says about Google. \u201cThe only truth they want you to know is what the government tells you.\u201d\n\nOther platforms have published these same questions without issue, but not Google. In essence, Google is working on behalf of the government to silence all truth about covid and the injections.\n\n\u201cIn short, Google Surveys will not allow us to question the government narrative,\u201d Kirsch further writes.\n\n\u201cClearly, Google doesn\u2019t want anyone in America to know how safe the vaccines are. You simply are not allowed to question the government narrative.\u201d\n\nBased on the results of his many other surveys, Kirsch is convinced \u2013 as we are \u2013 that Chinese Virus shots are in no way safe, left alone effective. Google apparently knows this, too, which is why Kirsch\u2019s surveys are not allowed there.\n\nWhat this means, of course, is that Google is complicit in the mass genocide of humanity via covid injections, which are still being pumped into people\u2019s bodies on a daily basis \u2013 with young children as the latest victims.\n\nGoogle\u2019s latest code of conduct reads: \u201cAnd remember \u2026 don\u2019t be evil, and if you see something that you think isn\u2019t right \u2013 speak up!\u201d Kirsch is trying to do just that.\n\n\u201cI think this isn\u2019t right,\u201d Kirsch writes. \u201cWill anyone at Google speak up? Wouldn\u2019t it be great if Google acknowledged the error and ran the survey and published the results? Don\u2019t hold your breath on that ever happening!\u201d\n\nKirsch also attempted to post his survey to the Nextdoor app, which also removed it within 24 hours. According to Kirsch, almost everyone on the Nextdoor app is \u201cpro-vaccine,\u201d and he is considered to be \u201can evil person there.\u201d\n\nThe latest news about Fauci Flu shots can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nSteveKirsch.substack.com\n\nNaturalNews.com",
        "(Natural News) Big Food and Big Pharma have the candle burning at both ends when it comes to the health of the majority of Americans. It\u2019s one big cash cow, and what you don\u2019t know WILL hurt you. Today\u2019s children are at the forefront of this evil scheming, and the food they eat regularly fuels the \u201cdisorders\u201d that are all now described in great detail in the DSM \u2013 the psychiatry \u201cbible\u201d used for slinging dangerous, prescription anti-psychosis drugs at everyone, including children and toddlers.\n\nDoes your child suffer from depression, panic attacks, or \u201cbipolar disorder?\u201d It could all be because of the aspartame\n\nNearly all \u201csugarless\u201d and \u201csugar-free\u201d chewing gum and candy contains a health-decimating food-drug called aspartame. The same goes for those \u201cdiet\u201d and \u201czero\u201d sugar sodas and drink mixes. Most parents severely underestimate the power of this genetically modified artificial sweetener to wreck the mental health of a human being, especially and young, developing one.\n\nAspartame can cause changes in neurotransmitter precursors, having a profound effect on cognition and mood, leading to \u201cclinical depression\u201d (as the psychiatry industry loves to label it), anxiety, panic attacks, irritability and impairment of concentration and memory.\n\nAspartame is the perfect \u201cprescription\u201d for the need of anti-psychotics medications later. See the formula? It\u2019s clear as day, and millions of people, including teens, children and toddlers, are consuming aspartame all day, every day, in multiple ways.\n\nAspartame has also been shown to deplete serotonin, triggering manic depression, paranoia, insomnia and suicidal tendencies.\n\nStudy published in the journal Experimental Neurology found MSG causes injury to the neuronal cell bodies in the hypothalamus\n\nMonosodium glutamate, a.k.a. \u201cMSG,\u201d causes lesions in the brain according to multiple studies, which can result in brain swelling and death. Way back in 2008 and 2009, several studies were done on lab animals that revealed MSG causing hypothalmic lesions caused by early onset obesity, all caused by MSG consumption. Results and conclusions of this evidence-based science were published in the journal Experimental Neurology.\n\nScientists said that MSG consumption had a significant and shocking impact on brain cell swelling, and that mature neurons were the most susceptible to the toxic effects of the concentrated salt found in thousands of FDA-approved food and medicine products, plus it\u2019s found in certain vaccines. Imagine the horrific effects of injecting this known neurotoxin. You\u2019ll find it in multi-dose flu shots and the infamous MMR vaccine.\n\nMSG can also be found in many common products, including chips, dips, salad dressings, soups, frozen meals, processed meats, seasoning blends, instant noodles and of course, most of the spicy Chinese food.\n\nPsychiatry industry takes advantage of bad childhood consumption habits by slinging experimental drugs using false diagnosis\n\nOh, the psycho-industrial complex of America. How evil they are. One of the scariest things any parent can do in this country is take their child to a psychiatrist for help with mental issues. It\u2019s like swimming in a swamp at night while wearing a meat suit.\n\nThe crocodiles and alligators will come, but in the form of pharma shills who get bonuses for \u201cattacking\u201d your child with experimental drugs (SSRIs) that exacerbate the problems caused by the toxic food, medicine and vaccines the pediatricians and CDC highly recommend (and the FDA approves). Children eat high-fructose-corn-syrup loaded cereals and pop tarts for breakfast, then can\u2019t sit still at school or daycare all morning. This is diagnosed by psychiatrists as ADD and ADHD.\n\nKids chew gum, eat candy and drink diet drinks (because most are overweight and/or obese), and the aspartame causes CNS imbalances. This is diagnosed by psychiatrists as clinical depression and panic attacks. It\u2019s a vicious cycle and it just goes round and round. What a cash cow for the crooked doctors, big food and big pharma in general.\n\nTop 8 ways childhood health is disturbed by toxic food and medicine\n\n#1. Aspartame \u2013 causes nervousness and anxiety\n\n#2. Monosodium Glutamate \u2013 causes severe migraines and brain damage in toddlers\n\n#3. High Fructose Corn Syrup \u2013 causes ADD and ADHD\n\n#4. COVID-19 masks \u2013 deprive the person of up to 20% of needed oxygen, all day\n\n#5. COVID-19 \u201cvaccines\u201d \u2013 can cause blood clots in the body and brain\n\n#6. Industrial-based food dyes \u2013 cause ADD and ADHD\n\n#7.

The Covid injection has been reported to potentially cause or worsen diabetes, the study authors wrote.\n\n\u201cFour weeks after the second vaccination, [the 73-year-old\u2019s] glycaemic control began to deteriorate, and 8 weeks after the second vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with new-onset type 1 diabetes that was strongly positive for autoantibodies and showed a disease-susceptible human leukocyte antigen haplotype, DRB1*04:05:01-DQB1*04:01:01. \u201cAlthough most of the cases concluded to be the onset or exacerbation of type?2 diabetes occurred early after the first or second vaccination, the diagnosis of type?1 diabetes took a relatively long period (4\u20138?weeks) after the second vaccination, including the previously reported case as well as the present case. The difference in the duration between the vaccination and the onset of hyperglycaemia could imply multiple and complicated mechanisms for the development of hyperglycaemia associated with the vaccination. \u201cThe administration of adjuvants to individuals genetically predisposed to the disease can cause serious adverse effects through activation of autoimmune cascades and pathways, which is called autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA syndrome). \u201cAlthough Moderna Covid-19 vaccine does not contain any additional adjuvants, polyethylene glycol lipid conjugates contained in the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines might act as an adjuvant and induce autoimmune responses, and mRNA appears to have self-adjuvant properties. \u201cIn recipients with the disease-susceptible haplotypes, one should be cautious about autoimmune responses for several months after the vaccination.\u201d Sasaki H, Itoh A, Watanabe Y, Nakajima Y, Saisho Y, Irie J, Meguro S, Itoh H.

Current lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health,\u201d the declaration continued.\n\n\u201cThe results (to name a few) include lower childhood vaccination rates, worsening cardiovascular disease outcomes, fewer cancer screenings and deteriorating mental health \u2013 leading to greater excess mortality in years to come, with the working class and younger members of society carrying the heaviest burden. Keeping students out of school is a grave injustice,\u201d it added.\n\nThe declaration also predicted, essentially, that \u201c[k]eeping these measures in place until a vaccine is available will cause irreparable damage, with the underprivileged disproportionately harmed.\u201d\n\nTurns out that they were right.\n\nAccording to new studies, the closures \u201chave had a devastating impact on children\u2019s mental health, development and future earnings potential,\u201d Fox News reported earlier this week, adding: \u201cAccording to data released last month by the National Center for Education Statistics, 70% of U.S. public schools have reported an increase in students seeking mental health services since the start of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nWe wish the plaintiffs luck in holding big tech accountable as well as any government official who had a role in the insanity.\n\nSources include:\n\nReclaimTheNet.org\n\nFoxNews.com",
        "(Natural News) Not satisfied with merely destroying the U.S. economy and American families\u2019 ability to earn a living, Joe Biden\u2019s Obama handlers are now going after the U.S. military as well.\n\nAccording to Russia Today (RT), the Pentagon\u2019s website shows 268,858 \u201cpartially vaccinated\u201d individuals across the Army, Marines, Navy and Air Force, plus another 50,710 civilian employees.\n\nThat said, the figure does not include the number of service members who have yet to get even one jab, which means that the overall number of military personnel who could be negatively impacted by the Biden regime\u2019s vaccine mandates is no doubt significantly higher.\n\nUnvaccinated personnel who have made requests for medical and religious exemptions are currently exempt from the requirement, but that is just a court decision away from changing. Besides, according to Marine reservist Mike Berry, exemptions for religious beliefs have only been granted so far for personnel who are on their way out of the military and won\u2019t be available to be deployed anyway.\n\n\u201cSome 6,400 servicemembers have already been kicked out for refusing to get the shot, with the majority being Marines, according to statistics cited by Breitbart. That\u2019s despite the fact that a court injunction has barred the Navy from discharging any sailor seeking a religious exemption. While political pushback has stopped the Pentagon from labeling the departed with a dishonorable discharge, even a \u2018general\u2019 discharge can mean a loss of benefits and a black mark on a soldier\u2019s disciplinary record,\u201d the RT report added.\n\n\u201cThe Army began stepping up administrative proceedings against the partially- and un-vaccinated last week, explaining the noncompliant would no longer receive pay as of July or be allowed to participate in \u2018federally funded drills and training.\u2019 A statement by the military branch warns those who refuse the mandatory vaccination order \u2018may be subject to additional adverse administrative action, including separation.'\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon-imposed deadline for U.S. Army Reserve and National Guard troops to get their vaccines came and went last week. Overall, some 12 percent of reservists, or about 22,740 members, have not yet been fully vaccinated. Meanwhile, around 13.1 percent of Army National Guard troops, or about 44,000, also have not been vaccinated, a military spokesperson told the Army Times.\n\nWhen asked about the Pentagon potentially having to discharge tens of thousands of soldiers who aren\u2019t vaccinated, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Army Gen. Mark Milley said that \u201cthe numbers are very low, by the way, of those that are refusing to be vaccinated.\u201d He also claimed that soldiers should stop complaining and simply take the vaccine, regardless of any other concerns.\n\nThis is from a general and military branch that makes uniform and other exemptions for soldiers and officers of various other religions not of the Christian faith.\n\n\u201cHowever, a recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association confirmed servicemembers are suffering serious side effects from the vaccines, including myocarditis,\u201d RT reported.\n\nAt the same time, there has been some relief for troops who are resisting the vaccine.\n\nU.S. District Judge Matthew McFarland, a Trump appointee, ordered the Air Force to pause discharging members who requested religious exemptions from the service\u2019s vaccine requirement, according to Fox News. The current pause is set for 14 days.\n\nThe initial lawsuit was launched by just 100 plaintiffs at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, but the ruling now applies to thousands of Air Force personnel around the world.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased by the judge\u2019s decision protecting the constitutional rights of service members who have dedicated their lives to protecting our constitutional rights,\u201d attorney Chris Wiest told local outlet FOX19. \u201cWe will continue to litigate this case to its conclusion and look forward to continuing this battle with the federal government.\u201d\n\nThank goodness for Trump\u2019s commitment to putting constitutionalists on the federal bench. Otherwise, our national security would be completely compromised by vaccine lunacy.\n\nSources include:\n\nRT.com\n\nFoxNews.com",
        "(Natural News) The Spanish government sprayed lethal chemtrails on its citizens under a United Nations program to fight the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) barely a month after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global pandemic.\n\nThe chemtrail operation was actually authorized by a royal decree on March 14, 2020, just three days after the official announcement of the pandemic. The Boletin Oficial del Estado (BOE) \u2013 Spain\u2019s official state gazette \u2013 published the order the following day and was acknowledged by Madrid on April 16, 2020.\n\nThe UN-backed project was done under the cover of the \u201cstate of emergency for the management of the health crisis situation caused by COVID-19.\u201d\n\nSpain\u2019s State Meteorological Agency (AEMET) took part in the biocide spraying operation. The entirety of Spain was locked down to stop the spread of COVID-19 \u2013 and to facilitate the aerial spraying operations. (Related: Spanish government admits to spraying chemtrails on citizens, at behest of the UN.)\n\nThe decree authorized all units under the Spanish Armed Forces, including military emergency units, to use biocide chemicals approved by the Ministry of Health (MOH) for disinfection in order to deal with the COVID-19 health crisis.\n\nIt also declared \u201ca state of emergency for the management of the health crisis situation caused by COVID-19, which includes a series of measures aimed at protecting the welfare, health and safety of citizens and the containment of the progression of the disease and strengthen the public health system.\u201d\n\nSalvador Illa, the Spanish health minister, was given the authority to \u201cdictate\u201d orders to the \u201cmilitary\u201d for the duration of the \u201chealth emergency.\u201d\n\nThe order explicitly called for the use of \u201caerial media\u201d and \u201caerial disinfection techniques\u201d to reach all surfaces quickly via techniques of nebulization, thermo nebulization and micro nebulization.\n\nSpain previously involved in a chemtrail scandal\n\nPrior to the April 2020 aerial spraying, Madrid had been involved in a chemtrail scandal as attested by former Member of the European Parliament (MEP) Ramon Tremosa i Balcells.\n\nThe MEP testified in Brussels back in May 2015 that four AEMET workers blew the whistle on chemtrails. According to the whistleblowers, planes were regularly spraying chemicals throughout the country.\n\n\u201cTremosa announced in the European Parliament that four workers from [AEMET] had confessed that Spain is being sprayed entirely from planes that spread lead dioxide, silver iodide and diatomite through the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nAccording to the MEP, the operation sought to ward off rains and allow temperatures to rise. This subsequently resulted to a summery environment for tourism and more favorable conditions for corporations in the agricultural sector growing their crops. In turn, the resulting aerial spraying to geo-engineer the climate is producing cold drops of great intensity.\n\nAreas located in southeastern Spain such as Murcia, Valencia and Almeria suffered the most \u2013 to the extent that not a drop of rain has fallen there in more than seven months. The chemtrails also gave rise to catastrophic \u201cgota fria\u201d storms. Worse, respiratory diseases among the population emerged since most of them inhale the lead dioxide and other toxic compounds sprayed by the aircraft.\n\nVisit ChemtrailsNews.com for more news related to deadly chemtrails on air.\n\nWatch the video that talks about Spain admitting to chemtrail spraying as part of a UN secret program.\n\nThis video is from the TNTVNews channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore related stories:\n\nThe COVID-19 extinction level event.\n\nToxic chemicals in the environment are making children dumber.\n\nTop 10 DRUG, CHEMICAL and TOXIN delivery devices used for population reduction and genocide.\n\nFive ways to clear the body of chemtrail toxins.\n\nSources include:\n\nGlobalResearch.ca\n\nPhilosophers-Stone.info\n\nBrighteon.com",

        "A horrifying compilation of vaccine-injured individuals exposes the extent of the damage caused by the experimental COVID-19 mRNA shots since their rollout in 2021.\n\nThe lengthy video from March 2022 highlighting the extent of COVID jab injuries across America was shared by Dr. Joseph Mercola on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cTheir struggle, their pain, their deaths deserve to be acknowledged for what they are \u2014 the result of medical malfeasance, regulatory corruption and societal \u2018mass formation\u2019 insanity driven by media fearmongering and outright lies,\u201d Mercola wrote.\n\n\u201cA common thread in these stories is the consistent dismissal by the medical community.

Pfizer is committing crimes against humanity, specifically against our children.\n\nThe vaccine has resulted in cardiac arrest not in an elderly person but in a two month old baby.\n\n\u201cWhy did they not follow up on the 2-month-old baby\u2019s condition, after going into cardiac arrest an hour after receiving an experimental vaccine? Why is there no further information? Is it because he died? Or was the baby removed from an experiment? Why would the author of the report not mention this?\u201d\n\nWe call upon the US Department of Justice to undertake a criminal investigation against Pfizer.\n\nWe call upon governments worldwide to immediately suspend the mRNA vaccine.\n\nA class action law suit is also required on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of victims of the mRNA vaccine.\n\nNever mentioned by the media, Pfizer has a criminal record with the US Department of Justice.\n\nIn 2009 Pfizer was indicted on charges of \u201cfraudulent marketing\u201d.\n\nMichel Chossudovsky, Global Research, August 6, 2022\n\n***\n\nFirst published by globalresearch.ca on July 6, 2022\n\n***\n\nAn analysis of VAERS reports shows that contrary to the FDA\u2019s briefing document claiming that the majority of adverse events in Pfizers\u2019 clinical trial were non-serious \u2013 at least 58 cases of life-threatening side effects in infants under 3 years old who received mRNA vaccines were reported. For some, it is unclear if they survived. It is also unclear why the infants were vaccinated, and whether they were part of the clinical trials. However, in the upcoming FDA meeting on Wednesday, the FDA will not be able to argue it did not know\n\n\u201cChest pain; cardiac arrest; Skin cold clammy\u201d. This short description of a cardiac arrest, which occurred one hour after receiving a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, is taken from the VAERS system \u2013 the US Vaccine Adverse Eve Reporting System ( case number 1015467), and it does not refer to an elderly person, nor to a young adult, or even a teenager. It is hard to believe, but this report refers to a two-month-old baby.\n\n\u201cA 2-month-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BioNTech COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EL 739, via an unspecified route of administration on 02 Feb 2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation\u201d, thus stated in the report. \u201cPatient administered vaccination, observed for 15 minutes left the clinic then returned one hour later on 02 Feb 2021, presenting as skin cold, clammy and with chest pain, cardiac arrest event then developed, patient stabilised and transferred for further medical treatment\u2026 The outcome of the events was unknown. This case was reported as serious with seriousness criteria-life threatening from HA. No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected\u201d.\n\nHow did a 2-month-old baby receive the mRNA vaccine? These vaccines have not yet received EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) for approved use in children ages five and under by the FDA, or any other regulatory authority, and even if it will, the EUA will only include babies 6 months and older.\n\nWas this baby a participant in Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s clinical trials, testing efficacy and safety among babies?\n\nThe answer is unclear. According to the person who wrote the report \u201cUnsure if patient was enrolled in clinical trial\u201d. However, the author of the report also states that the report was \u201dreceived from a contactable Other Health Care Professional by Pfizer from the Regulatory Agency\u201d. This note implies that the infant might have actually participated in Pfizer\u2019s trial. The regulatory agency report Safety Report Unique Identifier GB-MHRA-ADR 24687611 \u2013 indicates that the report came from Great Britain (the first 2 letters in the report ID stand for the country of origin, GB- Great Britain, and MHRA indicate that the source of reporting was its\u2019 drug authority).\n\nWhy did they not follow up on the 2-month-old baby\u2019s condition, after going into cardiac arrest an hour after receiving an experimental vaccine? Why is there no further information? Is it because he died? Or was the baby removed form an experiment? Why would the author of the report not mention this?\n\nShockingly, it turns out that this incident is not isolated, but in fact one of many in the VAERS system, describing babies and children under five exposed to mRNA Covid vaccines, who suffered life-threatening adverse reactions.\n\nEven though children under five were not considered eligible for these vaccines unless they were part of a clinical trial, astonishingly, it appears that there are many reports in the system describing babies and toddlers who were vaccinated. Some of the children suffered from life-threatening adverse events. In some cases, it is not clear what happened to them; did they survive and recover, do they still suffer from health problems, or did they die.\n\nIn a couple of days, on June 15, the FDA\u2019s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee will discuss Moderna and Pfizer\u2019s EUA requests for vaccines for infants and toddlers aged 6 months to 4 years \u2013 the only group not yet eligible for COVID-19 vaccination today.\n\nAccording to the FDA\u2019s briefing document released today ahead of the VRBPA committees\u2019 meeting, there were \u201c245 US reports\u201d to the VAERS system \u201cin children 6 months through 4 years of age\u201d, who were injected (\u201cproduct administered to patient of inappropriate age\u201d or \u201coff-label use\u201d) or exposed to the vaccine \u201cvia breastmilk\u201d. Nevertheless, both companies announced already in May that their findings indicate that their vaccines are safe and effective.\n\nThe VRBPAC Briefing Document lists a variety of adverse events reported following the exposure to the vaccine in this age group, including \u201cpyrexia\u2026, body temperature\u2026, cough, headache, rash, diarrhea\u201d. According to the document, \u201cAmong US VAERS reports for individuals aged 6 months through 4 years, which may reflect unauthorized use of the vaccine or may reflect a reporting error, the majority (96.3%) were non-serious\u201d.\n\nWhile the document specifies safety concerns identified from post-authorization safety surveillance data in VAERS, including anaphylaxis, myocarditis, and pericarditis, it does not relate to these safety concerns identified in the younger age group. Instead, it states: \u201cNo unusual frequency, clusters, or other trends for adverse events were identified that would suggest a new safety concern\u201d.\n\nBut is that really the case? It seems that regardless of the results, and despite the disturbing and shocking findings that are being exposed from Pfizer\u2019s documents, it is expected that both companies will receive the desired EUA very soon. In fact, the CDC website, already in April, had advertised a protocol regarding children\u2019s vaccination, which included babies 6 month to 4 years as well.\n\nIn light of this expected approval, RT Magazine conducted an analysis of the cases reported in the VAERS system referring to babies up to 3 years old.\n\nDuring the analysis, cases were removed in which it was stated that the exposure to the vaccine was through breastfeeding (these cases were analyzed separately and will soon be presented in a follow-up article), as well as cases that were identified as errors in the age registration.\n\nThe analysis shows there were at least 58 cases of severe and life-threatening adverse reactions among babies and toddlers 3 years old and younger. This finding is especially puzzling considering the fact that they weren\u2019t supposed to be vaccinated at this age to begin with. Sadly, similarly to the case reported above, most VAERS reports do not indicate how and under which circumstances they were exposed to the vaccine \u2013 were they participants in the companies\u2019 trials? And if not, why and in which circumstances were they vaccinated?\n\nBoth companies have not yet released the safety data from their trials on this age group. However, one thing is clear from the VAERS reports: there were many babies who were injured after receiving the vaccine. Whether they were vaccinated in the trials or illegally in their communities, Pfizer and Moderna will defiantly not be able to claim, when presenting their data to the FDA, that the vaccine is safe for babies, and that there weren\u2019t any severe adverse events in this age group. Moreover, the FDA\u2019s committee experts who will discuss the EUA approval will not be able to ignore those cases and argue that they did not know. The data presented in this article demonstrate beyond any doubt the complete opposite, and this time \u2013 these data are presented to the public in advance, before the EUA is granted and ahead of the VRBPAC discussion.\n\nThe outcome of the events: Did not recover\n\nOne of the most chilling reports refers to a 43-day-old female baby, who on January 30, 2021, received Pfizer\u2019s Comirnaty vaccine. In the incident description (report no. 1133837) it is clearly stated that she was vaccinated and that the vaccine was injected to the muscle: \u201cA 43-days-old female patient received bnt162b2 (COMIRNATY), intramuscular on 30Jan2021 (Lot Number: EK9788) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation\u201d. Right after the vaccination, the baby suffered a variety of life-threatening multi-system injuries, such as \u201cAnaphylactic reaction (broad), Asthma/bronchospasm (narrow), Anticholinergic syndrome (broad), Acute central respiratory depression (broad), Pulmonary hypertension (broad), Cardiomyopathy (broad), Eosinophilic pneumonia (broad), Vestibular disorders (broad), Hypersensitivity (broad), Respiratory failure (narrow), Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (broad)\u201c. Although in the section reporting death the statement states \u201cNo\u201d, the section reporting recovery also states \u201cNo\u201d \u2013 meaning the baby has not recovered. What then happened to her? Is she alive or did she die?\n\nIn addition, this report, like many others, raises some difficult questions. How did a 43-day-old baby receive a vaccine not yet approved for use in babies? Furthermore, the current clinical trials conducted are supposed to include babies and children over 6 months. Was this baby a participant in Pfizers\u2019 trial? The report does not answer to this question.\n\nJust like this baby, it turns out that in most of the reported cases several life-threatening side effects were recorded for the same baby. The most common severe adverse events were dangerous hemorrhaging; anaphylactic shock \u2013 a life-threatening allergy that can damage the respiratory system and cause dizziness, fainting, and even death; anticholinergic syndrome- a condition that occurs when the receptor sites for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine are blocked, which can lead to coordination problems, increased heart rate, and other symptoms; encephalitis \u2013 a brain infection, that can cause headaches, vomiting, loss of consciousness and death; hypoglycemia \u2013 very low blood sugar, a condition that can quickly escalate to death in infants; and neuroleptic syndrome \u2013 which is also life-threatening , and can damage the heart muscles, other muscles, and the kidneys.\n\nFrom the summary of the findings of the analysis according to age and gender groups, the following picture emerges:\n\nIn the age group of 0-6 months \u2013 there are 28 reports, in which 10 are males, 16 are females, and 2 whose gender was not specified.\n\n9 of them (32%) suffered an anticholinergic syndrome, 9 (32%) had an anaphylactic shock, 8 (28.6%) suffered Neuroleptic syndrome, 5 suffered from heart rhythm irregularities, and 5 had hypoglycemia.\n\nIn the age group of 6-12 months \u2013 in this group, 5 reports were found \u2013 3 males, one female, and one whose gender was not specified. This group is small compared to the other groups. The list of adverse reactions included: anaphylactic shock, anticholinergic syndrome, and Neuroleptic syndrome.\n\nIn the age group of one-to-three year old \u2013 in this group 25 cases were reported, of which 5 related to males, 19 related to females, and one to a baby whose gender was not specified.\n\n6 of the babies (24%) had an anaphylactic shock, 6 (24%) suffered anticholinergic syndrome, 5 (20%) suffered from Neuroleptic syndrome, 4 (16%) suffered encephalitis, 3 (12%) had irregular heartbeats, one baby was hemorrhaging and one suffered from hypoglycemia.\n\nIt should be noted that the adverse events listed above are only some of the ones reported in VAERS with respect to babies. We have chosen to focus only on life-threatening and common adverse events.\n\nTable No. 1: Analysis of reports by age and gender\n\nTable No. 2: Analysis of reports by adverse events\n\nAre the babies alive?\n\nSimilarly to the previous case described, another baby, two months old, also went through anaphylactic shock after being exposed to a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on January 6, 2021, and just like her, according to the report (no. 976433), she suffered from an array of multi-system symptoms. Regarding the method of administering the vaccine, it was stated \u201dvia an unspecified route of administration\u201d, meaning it is not clear in what circumstances the baby was exposed to the vaccine.\n\nWas she part of Pfizers\u2019 clinical trial? Again, it is unclear from the report.\n\nHowever, the more important question that should be asked, just like in the previous case, is what happened to the baby? Did she survive? Is she alive?\n\nAnd again, in the section reporting death, it states \u201cNo\u201d, meaning the baby did not die. However, in the report description it says, \u201cThe patient had not recovered from the event. No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected\u201d.\n\nIt is hard to believe, but this basic question \u2013 what happened to a baby after suffering such severe and life-threatening adverse reactions \u2013 also arises from other serious cases, such as the case of a 6-month-old baby (report # 2084418) who \u201creceived bnt162b2 (COMIRNATY), intramuscular\u201d on December 29, 2021, and went through anaphylactic shock, anticholinergic syndrome, Neuroleptic syndrome, infectious pneumonia, other infections, and multi-system symptoms.\n\nIn this case as well, the section reporting death states \u201cNo\u201d, meaning supposedly the baby did not die, while in the event description it says \u201coutcome \u2018unknown\u2019\u2026 No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected\u201d.\n\nIn another case (report no. 1012508) a one-year-old baby who also received a Pfizer vaccine, in January 19, 2021 (this case it is specified that the baby did not take part in a trial) developed a pain in her left ear that escalated to full paralysis, which was diagnosed as Guillain Barre syndrome. In the case description it was stated that the baby suffered Guillain Barre Syndrome, face paralysis, non-infectious encephalitis, non-infectious meningitis, earaches and hearing disorders. Nonetheless, in the summary of the report, it was written, again, that \u201cNo follow-up attempts are possible\u201d.\n\nAnd another shocking case (report number 1379484) emerges from the report of a baby who was only one month old, who suffered \u201cVaginal bleeding/ Constant heavy vaginal bleeding with chunks of clot\u201d the following day after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on May 19, 2021.\n\nAlthough the symptoms the baby suffered from were defined as \u201cserious as medically significant\u201d, in the incident description it is stated that the result is \u201cunknown\u201d and that \u201cNo follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected\u201d.\n\nAs mentioned, in some of the cases it is stated the babies were not part of a clinical trial, while in others it is not clear whether they participated in a clinical trial or were vaccinated in other unknown circumstances. But whether they were part of the trial or not, the report does not explain the absence of this critical information; what happened to these babies? Did they survive? And if so, did they recover? Why was there not a follow-up on the medical condition of babies who suffered from severe and life-threatening adverse events, while it was clearly stated that they did not recover? Is it not required in such severe cases by the FDA that the company should make every effort to locate these babies, find out what their condition is and follow up on them?\n\n\u201cRedness in the injection area: the clinical trial protocol does not mention severe adverse reactions\u201d\n\nThe press release issued in February 11, 2022, in which Pfizer-BioNTech announced that they intend to apply to the FDA for approval for infants from 6 months to 4 years of age, the safety findings from the company\u2019s clinical trials in babies and toddlers at these ages are not mentioned, not even in a word. The information brochure regarding the clinical trials testing the safety and efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine in adults, children and babies, on the FDA website, clearly states \u201cNo Study Results Posted on ClinicalTrials.gov for this Study\u201d. And as noted above, the newly released The VRBPAC Briefing Document only lists a handful of non-serious adverse events reported in this age group, including, and concludes that there is nothing that would suggest a new safety concern. How could the FDA not know about so many serious adverse events that were reported to the CDC\u2019s reporting systems? Alternatively, if they do know about them \u2013 why are they ignoring them?\n\nHow were adverse events in babies tested than in the clinical trials? In an attempt to answer this critical question, intended to address the safety issues and to assure parents that the vaccine is safe for babies, we examined the study protocol found on the FDA clinical trial website.\n\nIt appears that no potential severe adverse events were listed. The list of potential adverse events that the study was supposed to evaluate according to the protocol (\u201coutcome measure\u201d) did include both local and systemic reactions. However, these are relatively non-serious adverse events.\n\nThe list of local adverse events that the trial was supposed to monitor includes: \u201cPain or tenderness at the injection site, redness and swelling\u201d, and the systematic reactions included \u201dFever, fatigue, headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, new or worsened muscle pain, new or worsened joint pain, decreased appetite, drowsiness, and irritability\u201d. Moreover, although the study is scheduled to end only on June 14, 2024, the time frame set for examining adverse events is limited to seven days after each of the doses \u2013 the first and the second dose.\n\nThe vaccine is ineffective in infants. The solution: lower the efficiency threshold and add a third dose\n\nIn addition to the substantial concerns regarding the vaccines\u2019 safety for babies, their efficacy in this age group is questionable by and large. According to the available data, healthy children are at almost zero risk for severe illness, hospitalization, or death due to COVID-19.\n\nHospitalization due to COVID-19 is very rare among children, and death cases are even rarer. In Germany, for instance, a large study found that not even one child died of COVID-19 among 5-11 age group without pre-existing conditions. Under these circumstances, even one case of a serious adverse event, let alone death, is crucial and outweighs any possible benefit of the vaccine.\n\nNot surprisingly, Pfizer clinical trials in babies under 4 proved that 2 vaccine doses do not increase their antibody count significantly. The FDA commissioner, Dr. Janet Woodcock, admitted in an interview in early April 2022 that \u201cThe antibodies that were developed were not as high, so they didn\u2019t have the same antibody response to the two-shot series in the older kids. It wasn\u2019t as high as what we would have hoped for the younger as it was for the older kids\u201d. According to Woodcock, this is why Pfizer, which planned to apply for EUA approval for babies in February, postponed the submittal date and decided to add a third dose to the trial and wait for the findings after all babies got their third dose.\n\nFurthermore, in a statement given on May 11, Dr. Peter Marks, director of the Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research at the FDA, announced that infant and toddler vaccines will not need to pass the 50% efficacy rate against Covid. A 50% efficacy rate is the threshold adult vaccines need to pass. However, Marks explains that despite the previous guidelines, the FDA will not deny companies now approval for babies and toddlers just because it did not reach the 50% efficacy in preventing symptomatic infections.\n\nPfizer issued a press release on May 23 announcing that \u201cVaccine efficacy of 80.3% was observed in descriptive analysis of three doses during a time when Omicron was the predominant variant\u201d. According to the press release, \u201cThe study suggests that a low 3-ug dose of our vaccine\u2026, provides young children with a high level of protection against the recent COVID-19 strains\u201d.\n\nYet, the FDA\u2019s briefing document reveals that the claim for a \u201chigh level of protection\u201d is based on a total of 10 symptomatic cases of COVID-19 identified in the trial, that occurred at least 7 days postDose 3. Three of them occurred among participants 6-23 months of age (which included 555 participants \u2013 376 in the vaccine group and 179 in the placebo group) \u2013 with 1 case in the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine group and two in the placebo group. Seven other cases occurred among participants 2-4 years of age (which included 860 participants \u2013 589 in the vaccine group and 271 in the placebo group) \u2013 with 2 cases in the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine group, compared to 5 in the placebo group. Nevertheless, the vaccine\u2019s efficacy was framed by the FDA as 80,4%, and the document concludes that \u201cAvailable data support the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine 3-dose primary series (3 \u00b5g each dose) in preventing COVID-19 in the age group of 6 months through 4 years\u201d. In addition, the document states that \u201cAmong infants and children 6 months through 4 years of age, rates of hospitalization and death due to COVID-19 are higher than among children and adolescents 5-17 years of age, and comparable to individuals 18-25 years of age, underscoring the benefit of an effective COVID19 vaccine in this age group\u201d.\n\nHow ethical is it to give a baby a vaccine for a disease that the chances of getting severely ill or dying from it is almost zero, while the benefits of the treatment are unclear and, and life-threatening adverse reactions are very significant?\n\nThis question was the topic of an article published in March this year in Bioethics. The researchers stated that not even one of the main claims argued to justify approval for babies is valid. According to them, the benefits of the vaccine for healthy children are minimal, and therefore, even though complications are rare, they outweigh the vaccine\u2019s benefits, especially since it is highly unclear what the short and long-term risks are, and the experience with the vaccine is very short. The altruistic claim of protecting the environment is also very problematic, since as a vaccine exists, the groups at risk can defend themselves, and it was proven already that children are not the main transmitters of the virus.\n\nCongress members demand answers\n\nThis ethical issue has been raised in recent days by 18 members of Congress in a letter issued to the FDA on June 7, demanding answers before the authority\u2019s decision to grant an emergency permit for the infant vaccine. Members of Congress demanded to know why COVID-19 vaccines are necessary for this age group in light of the fact that the disease poses a very small risk to infants and young children, that vaccines have little efficacy, and that there are many unanswered questions regarding these vaccines\u2019 safety and adverse events.\n\nThe letter presents 19 questions to the FDA, including, among others \u2013 why did the FDA delay the publication of the hundreds of thousands of data pages from the manufacturers\u2019 studies, the state of adverse events, and when can all FDA data be expected to be made public? The FDA was also asked to provide the public with more details regarding children who were severely injured or died from COVID-19, and how many children in general became seriously ill. Legislators also addressed the issue of cardiac risks in giving the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to children, noting that following vaccinations given to large numbers of children aged 5-18, an increase in myocarditis and pericarditis was observed, with some cases ending in death, and the long-term effects of heart-related inflammation not yet quantified by health authorities. What\u2019s more, lawmakers demanded to know why the FDA lowered the threshold of efficacy for the vaccines specifically for infants and youngest children, thus actually allowing companies to apply for EUA without any justification.\n\nThe FDA will not be able to argue it did not know\n\nAs stated, the data emerging from the analysis presented in this article demonstrate beyond any doubt that the vaccine is not safe for babies and toddlers. Whether these children were part of the study or not \u2013 these reports have been in the VAERS system for many months, so there is no chance that the FDA does not know them. Unfortunately, the fact that the FDA was aware of at least some of the serious adverse events, including increased risk of morbidity in the first days after vaccination, myocarditis, and increased risk of miscarriage and fetal malformations, and yet approved the vaccine for teens, children, and pregnant women, was later revealed too late \u2013 long after the EUA was granted to Pfizer and Moderna, when many have already been harmed. It only became clear thanks to FOIA (Freedom of Information) requests submitted to the FDA and other health authorities, and only after the FDA was forced by the court to disclose the documents. This time, the VAERS data presented here makes it possible to reveal this fact even before the approval. The FDA will not be able to claim that it did not know.\n\n*\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

        "Part 1\n\n\n\n1st Hour.mp3\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 2\n\n\n\n2nd Hour.mp3\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the book from the interview here or read all about it here.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is Revelation\u2019s mysterious overlooked star \u201cWormwood\u201d (Rev 6-8) the key to understanding Revelation? Answer\u2026",
        "The Book of Revelation may be a confusing book overall, but it is crystal clear on \"don't take the Mark of the Beast\" (Rev 14:9). Yet how do you obey that? Can they force the mark on you or trick you into taking it? Find out everything you need to know about the Mark of the Beast today\u2014plus a startling new insight on the months of torture awaiting those who take action too late.\n\nIf the Antichrist is the most dreaded threat of the Book of Revelation, then his mark would have to be a close second. Just as people wonder who might be the Antichrist today, they also wonder whether the Mark of the Beast is already here, such as in the COVID vaccines or passports. As a result, the following passage from Revelation about the Mark of the Beast is one of the most quoted passages in the Bible:\n\nThe Mark of the Beast Passage\n\nRevelation 13:16-18 (HCSB) \u2014 16 And he [the False Prophet] requires everyone \u2014small and great, rich and poor, free and slave\u2014 to be given a mark on his right hand or on his forehead , 17 so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark : the beast\u2019s name or the number of his name. 18 Here is wisdom:, The one who has understanding must calculate the number of the beast, because it is the number of a man. His number is 666.\n\nThis passage is talking about the Great Tribulation (Mt 24:21) or the time when the Antichrist (or first Beast of Revelation 13) rules the entire earth. The second beast of Revelation 13, also called the False Prophet (Rev 16:13; 19:20; 20:10), will put in place a system of total control. They will attempt to brand every human with a mark that is needed for commerce. Obviously, without being able to buy or sell anything, you are not going to function in society or last long.\n\nIt's very important to note two things that everyone seems to ignore: the mark cannot be here until the Antichrist and False Prophet rule. Most mark theorists overlook that.\n\nNot A Warning to Bible Readers! (New Insight)\n\nMore importantly, everyone misses that this passage is not a warning to us, the readers about the mark. It is a prophecy of a warning being proclaimed to the entire world at the start of the Great Tribulation! It goes out because the mark is then present. The warning prophecy gives readers a concept of what it will be like, but not enough detail to figure out exactly what it will be in advance; yet there's no need to, right? When it is here, then the warning will go out. Also, there will be no need for more \"clues\" to identify it as it will be made plainly clear that the mark is what the False Prophet is pushing on people. See how different that is from speculating about what it is today? You see then, there is no need to worry about the mark being here today nor any pressure to identify it now. You can't take it, and \"precursors\" (if such a thing were to exist) don't count!\n\nDespite the negatives to refusing the mark, it's plain from another passage that you do have the freewill choice to do that:\n\nRevelation 20:4 (HCSB) \u2014 Then I saw thrones, and people seated on them who were given authority to judge. I also saw the people, who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of God\u2019s word, who had not worshiped the beast or his gf image, and who had not accepted the mark on their foreheads or their hands .\n\nThis passage should reassure those who worry that they can be tricked into taking the mark or forced to take it without their permission. It seems that the False Prophet will need your permission. Otherwise, there would be nobody who \"had not accepted the mark.\" The bad news is that they will not accept your response of \"no, thank you\" kindly. They will try to persuade all people to take the mark through at least four separate pressures or methods of persuasion.\n\nClick here to jump to the update on Covid in prophecy\n\nFour Powerful Pressures For Taking the Mark\n\nThe first pressure is what Paul calls the strong delusion (2Th 2:11). The Antichrist will actually succeed in pawning himself off as God on earth ruling from the Third Temple in Jerusalem (2Th 2:4). Jesus said that this deception would be so convincing that even the \"very elect\" would be taken by it if it were possible. Thankfully, it's not possible because God intervenes with the Two Witnesses and 144,000 to preach the truth as an alternative to the popular lie (Mt 24:24). Despite God's counter-programming, the vast majority of the people are going to be convinced that the Antichrist is indeed God. This is due to the convincing signs performed at the hand of the False Prophet. These include calling fire down from heaven and making the image (statue) of the Beast that speaks (Rev 13:13-15).\n\nThe second pressure takes care of the minority of defiant skeptics who do not fall for the strong delusion. It appears from the passage above that the False Prophet will command death for those who refuse the mark. This is just as he does to those who refuse to worship the image/statue of the beast (Rev 13:15 = Rev 20:4). Many Christians will have read their Bibles or heard and believed the warning of the mark, but they simply are not martyr-material. They will crumble under the pressure. As Jesus said, the love of believers will wax cold and believers will betray each other to save their own skin (Mt 24:12, 10).\n\nUnderstanding the third and fourth pressures requires a correct understanding of the prophetic roadmap and especially where the Great Tribulation fits in it. Most believe or have been taught that the Great Tribulation begins at the 1st seal. While the white horseman does indeed seem to fit the Antichrist, that's an incorrect conclusion; it actually refers to what Jesus said about the many (religions) that would come in his name, talk about him, and deceive many (Mt 24:5). The real match for the rise of Antichrist and the start of the Great Tribulation is the 5th trumpet. When someone shows you the proof of how the Great Tribulation starts when Satan is cast out of heaven (he has not been cast out yet) as the start of three \"woes,\" the Great Tribulation / 5th trumpet connection becomes pretty self-evident (cf. Dan 12:1=Rev 12:7-17=Mt 24:15,21=Rev 9:1-6, 11-13).\n\nOnce you get that crucial point correct, it opens up the possibility of seeing a couple of other key insights. First, obviously, the 5th Trumpet follows the 4th Trumpet. The 4th Trumpet concludes the sequence of severe global catastrophes on earth caused by near-earth objects (such as Star Wormwood) starting at the 6th seal. This will leave the world in a state of devastation (Rev 6:14; 8:7, 9), fear, panic, chaos (Rev 6:15-16), dark , cold (Rev 8:12), smoke, fires (Rev 8:8-9), water scarcity (Rev 8:10-11) and famine (Rev 8:7, 9, 12). Second, this answers how the Antichrist comes to power. It provides the perfect scenario for the Antichrist as the would-be God and \"Savior of the world\" to appear as the only solution to so many problems\u2014including the severe food shortage. Probably the mark will be presented as part of his plan to solve both the security (identification) and shortages of basic necessities (rationing). (Americans saw a similar thing after the 9-11 attack with the push for a national ID called Real ID.)\n\nThus, the third pressure would be that, given the clear scarcity of food and clean water prior to the rise of the Beast, you will not get your basic living needs met without accepting the mark. The threat of death from thirst and starvation will already be mounting by the time the mark is presented to offer relief. If you do not take it, death will be knocking at the door. Principles and skepticism go out the window in such extreme situations.\n\nBut there are always stubborn, crafty, and prepared people who would still refuse the mark and scratch out an existence \"off the grid.\" There is apparently another, fourth pressure that will take care of even them. At the 5th Trumpet, we are told that an army of deadly scorpion-like locusts with teeth and stingers are released from imprisonment in the Abyss (Rev 9:1-3). Although lethal-looking (Rev 9:7-9), they do not go out to kill people; they only go out to torture everyone except the 144,000 and the other gathered-protected servants of God (Rev 9:4-5; 7:3-4; 12:13-17). It actually says people will seek death but be unable to find it (Rev 9:6). These demonic creatures will be able to search out every nook and cranny where survivalists and other resistors with stashes of food and ammunition are hiding (Joel 2:9). Their fortification, walls, and weapons will not protect them from the locusts (Joel 2:9). The torture will no doubt be very effective in getting them to accept the mark.\n\nRefuse the Mark = 5 Months of Painful Torture\n\nThe passage telling us that these tortured people \"will seek death and not find it\" during the five months seems like a contradiction with what we said above that the False Prophet will cause those refusing the mark to be killed. But if you think it through carefully, you'll see there is a resolution.\n\nIt points to a terrifying new realization about the mark that you probably never heard of before: Refusing the mark is not rewarded instantly with death. On the contrary, it is rewarded first with up to five months of torture to persuade you to accept the mark. At the end of the five months of the locusts' torture tour, they finally will put you to death. Why the delay? They may be sadists or they may simply prefer to have Beast kingdom subjects than dead defeated martyrs.\n\n(Note, that the locusts passage does not say all people besides God's sealed are tortured. It just says the power is there to do so. Since it makes no sense for the new Antichrist \"God\" to make his first order of business the torture of his admiring subjects, even those who accept him as \"God,\" I think it's a fair deduction that the power to torture is not used on those who take the mark. If he really wanted to capture, mark and torture everyone, then why stop after five months? But if the torture is to force the mark, then it makes sense that the torture is only used for a short time in the beginning. It only takes a few months to find and capture every single living human on earth who is trying to avoid the mark and to try to convince them to change their mind.)\n\nArticle continues below... The End In 2026? It's Now Possible Since learning in 2001 that Yeshua must return in a Sabbath year, I've had to rule out three Sabbath year cycle windows for the final 7 years (2003-2009, 2010-2016, 2017-2023). With the next window (2024-2030) less than 7 years away, I'm ready to share why I believe, based on the real end time sign of Mt 24:14, that this can be the one. If it is, the \"birth pains\" (WW3 + Wormwood, Lk 21:10-11) would hit near its middle in 2026 with Yeshua returning in 2030. Find out what's changed to convince me about 2026 and what you can do about it...\n\nIn summary, then, here are the four pressures on people that will make most people accept the mark:\n\nThe 4 Reasons Why Most People Will Take the Mark\n\nConvinced Antichrist is God on earth To avoid beheading To avoid starvation To avoid (up to) five months of torture\n\n\"Mark\" Only Figurative? Or Literal?\n\nTerrifying, isn't it? Anyone understanding just a fraction of the pressures coming to push the mark on people will naturally want to know exactly what it is now so they can be sure to see it coming. Actually, we'll see later why it is that if you want to successfully avoid it (and keep your life), you must never see it.\n\nYet people still persist in wanting to know what it is now. The first question, then, is to ask is what is the intended meaning of the passage describing the mark? Should we read it literally, as a visible marking on the skin of the hand or forehead or figuratively as something completely different (such as, say, \"Sabbath-breaking/Sunday worship\" like the Seventh Day Adventists and others believe)?\n\nA big reason for doubt about the interpretation of the mark passage comes from an uncannily similar instruction to ancient Israel recorded in the Torah about a sign/symbol in their forehead and hand (Ex 13:9, 16; Dt 6:8; 11:18):\n\nExodus 13:16 (HCSB) \u2014 So let it be a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead , for the LORD brought us out of Egypt by the strength of His hand.\n\nOrthodox Judaism uses this command to justify their tradition of binding \"phylacteries\" to the forehead and hands. However, most agree that ancient Israel did not follow this verse the way modern Judaism does. Instead, they understood it figuratively as telling them to keep the Torah firmly in mind (\"forehead\") and in their actions (the \"hand\"). If you agree with this interpretation, then it's natural to read the very similar passage in Revelation exactly the same way: figuratively (especially in a book like Revelation that is already assumed to be mostly symbolically figurative).\n\nBut we have to decide how to read a verse individually and in its own context. We cannot assume that every instance of every construct will be used the same, or misinterpretation will result. For example, there are at least three different meanings for the word translated \"star\" in the Book of Revelation alone (angels, meteors/\"shooting stars\", and literal stars)! In fact, the use of similar constructs for different purposes seems to be one of the ways that God made the Bible tricky on purpose as Isaiah and Jesus declared about God's word (Isa 6:9-10; Mk 4:11; Mt 13:11; Lk 8:10; 10:21-24).\n\nWhy Only a Literal Mark Works\n\nWhenever you are in doubt after carefully considering a verse in context, you can usually resolve it by looking at related passages or in other words by looking at it in the greater Biblical context. Revelation 14:9 is another passage dealing with the Mark of the Beast which we can consult for help. Using it, we can dispel any doubt about the literal meaning of the Mark of the Beast.\n\nThis passage is the third of three angel's warnings delivered to mankind. This third message specifically warns everyone about the grave consequences of receiving the Mark of the Beast in the \"forehead\" or \"hand:\"\n\nRevelation 14:9-10 (HCSB) \u2014 9 And a third angel followed them and spoke with a loud voice: \" If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand ...10... he will also drink the wine of God\u2019s wrath , He will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the sight of the holy angels\n\nNow think about the theory of a figurative mark in the context of this dire warning. The unsuspecting general public is going to be given this warning so that they are able to know what to do to avoid God's wrath, a very serious thing indeed. They will need simple clear understandable instructions that they can act on. But a message referencing a forbidden figurative mark is not clear but requires further explanation or thought before people can know what it is they must avoid. This would leave people uncertain and unable to follow the instructions.\n\nIf the warning tells you to reject any future leader who wants to put a literal mark on your skin (forehead or right hand), that's very understandable and actionable. If it's figurative, where the mark can be anything like keeping Sunday vs. Sabbath, how would you be sure?\n\nSince a figurative mark does not work in the warning here, then why did God use figurative language to \"warn\" Israel about keeping Torah in their thoughts and deeds? It worked for that because that earlier hand/forehead sign referenced something that he had already told them volumes about: the Torah. He wanted to communicate to them how integral they needed to make Torah to their life and he did so using a powerful metaphorical illustration. In contrast, the Mark of the Beast warning is a stand-alone command to the general public to whom God has only spoken two other messages ever in total. Metaphorical language does not get the job done. The warning about receiving a \"mark in the head or hand\" can only refer to a literal marking on the forehead or hand which people can readily understand, identify, and know what to do when they encounter it.\n\nBut Wait...If There Will Be a Universal Warning, Why Won't Everyone Just Listen and Avoid the Mark?\n\nWith that question settled by the third angel worldwide warning text, another question is raised. If the warning about the mark is going to be as global and clear as stated above, then why will anyone get trapped into taking the mark?\n\nThis is a simple question with a not-so-simple answer. It requires knowing several aspects of the end times in order to understand it. To help with that, let me outline the distinct categories people will fall into when the mark is out:\n\n3 Categories of People When the Mark Comes\n\nMark accepters (alive, but destined for God's wrath) Mark rejecters/martyrs (dead or soon-to-be-dead(see below) but destined for the First Resurrection) Mark evaders (alive and destined for the rapture)\n\nThe first two categories are obvious and self-explanatory, but the last one, of mark evader, requires explanation. The mark evaders are obviously similar to the mark rejecters in wanting to heed the universal warning about not taking the mark. However, they differ from the mark rejecters in the two aspects of proactivity and of faith. We shall see that to evade the mark is not as simple or foolproof as it may seem to you now.\n\nFaith Needed To Obey the Warning\n\nBy way of illustration, you could compare it to the challenge of getting a girl to evade teen pregnancy by giving her a warning about it when she is ten years old. She may agree at that age that teen pregnancy is a bad outcome which she does not want. Yet, after she passes puberty, certain temptations must be resisted or certain actions be taken for the teen pregnancy warning to work out well.\n\nSimilarly, when you hear the warning about the mark, you must take a specific action before the mark even arrives. If you do not do so, it will be too late and you will get pregnant, as the analogy goes, or be left with choices 1 and 2 above only. That's the proactive aspect of evading the mark.\n\nThe faith aspect of evading the mark comes in because the action required to avoid the mark will be to \"come out of Babylon\" (Rev 18:4; Jer 50:8; 51:6, 9, 45). The end-time prophecies of the Bible repeatedly speak of God leading his faithful servants out of their home countries to a place he prepares to feed them during the Great Tribulation (Rev 12:12-17). However, it will not be so clear that this is right to do, as it is to, say, exit a burning house when someone shouts \"Fire! Get out!\" Probably everything in the world will look as fine (if you can call it that) as it does today. It will be counter-intuitive.\n\nIt has been my experience that when this clear (future) travel prophecy from the Bible is shared with normal church-going Christians, they reflexively reject it. It sounds ridiculous to the average Christian that God would ever require his people to do something so radical as to leave their homes. Many of them miss the obvious irony in their objection to a future God-given travel command in light of the fact that God has done this very thing repeatedly in the past with his faithful servants as the OT records. He told Abraham to leave his country. Lot had to leave Sodom. He told the entire nation of Israel to leave Egypt. Sure, they were slaves there anyway, but there are many parallels to their literal slavery and our modern slavery to sin, addictions, distractions, etc. in our home countries that an end-time exodus would release us from, too.\n\n(Note: A major reason that many despair upon hearing about needing to move to escape the end times, is that, again, they are not remembering the lessons of the Exodus. When God commanded Israel to leave Egypt, he did not abandon them but gave them tremendous \"provision to go along with the commission\" as the saying goes. They had great leadership, divine protection, payment of back wages through spoiling of the Egyptians and miracles such as the Red Sea crossing, shoes not wearing out, healings, manna from heaven to feed them, water from the rock to drink, victory over their enemies, etc. We can expect the same thing again when God again commands his servants to march out. Passports, money, illnesses unwilling spouses, and children will all be worked out (cf Ex 19:4 = Rev 12:14). Hope this helps)\n\nNo Visible Angels\n\nAnother reason that faith will tie in greatly is that most likely, the instructions of the three angels will be spoken to people not by the three angels themselves, but by humans; prophets. This probably sounds ridiculous at first but if you read the passage carefully you'll note that it never quite says that the angels themselves do the preaching of their own messages (Rev 14:6). It simply says they \"have\" the messages to be preached. This leaves room for someone else to do the preaching. This phrasing is good because it does not make the passage break with precedent for how angels are tasked by God in the Bible. Angels usually interface only with the righteous or small groups of the public. When God deals with the general public or nations, he uses men exclusively.\n\nI think the answer to which men it will be this time is found, by no coincidence, in the verses immediately preceding (Rev 14:1-5). If you ever wondered who the 144,000 are and why they are given such special protection so that the Beast's forces cannot touch them, this would answer that. Their message of warning must go out without encumbrance to counteract the powerful dragnet that the Beast will be allowed to unleash on humanity. However, like all prophets before them, they are mere men and not as fearsome and compelling as an angel of light speaking before your eyes. People will be able to doubt and ignore the warnings and call to action of the 144,000 men.\n\n\"My pastor said not to go\"\n\nIt should not be hard for the reader to imagine how most Christians will scoff at even a real miracle-working Bible-conforming prophet sent by God telling people to \"come out of Babylon\" per the prophecies. Christians by nature rely on their pastors and other Christians to tell them what is right or what to do. They sincerely believe \"all these churches can't be wrong.\" Thus, when most churches advise people to ignore the crazy prophet message to leave and just stay \"safe in Jesus\" where they are and/or await the \"pretrib rapture,\" it will be largely followed. They will not have the faith or guts to obey the command to leave early enough in order to avoid the mark.\n\nThen, when they actually see the Abomination of Desolation (military takeover of Jerusalem and the Temple by the Antichrist) that they were warned would come, they will want to obey the \"crazy\" instructions they ignored years before. However, if they are not close to the location that God told them to move to, there will be no chance of them making it there in time before the Great Tribulation begins (30 days later).\n\nThe mark edict will soon be issued and they will be faced with the tough choice of option 1 or option 2.\n\nOption 3, of mark evasion, will have expired.\n\nWhy It's Not Already Here\n\nYou may have noticed that this article so far has not even touched on what most articles about this topic center on: speculation about which technology today is the Mark of the Beast. This is what is called \"newspaper exegesis,\" the popular practice of trying to interpret prophecy by the current events. As already covered, the mark does not come until the Antichrist rises after we leave. It's that simple.\n\nThat said, it would not hurt for me to share some other reasons why things popularly pushed as the mark cannot be it. Because, if you had not noticed, practically every popular new consumer technology ever invented, whether it be barcodes, credit cards, bio-chips, and RFID, have at one point been proposed as \"mark technology\" or a sign that the mark and Antichrist are near. Of course, after those technologies become prominent, ubiquitous and prove harmless and the Antichrist \"delays his coming\" (Lk 12:45) nobody remembers the speculation and people move on to newer technology.\n\n\"COVID Vaccines/Passports Are the Mark!\"\n\nAlong those lines, these days the latest theory is that the COVID vaccines or passports are the mark or a \"precursor.\" Again, precursors don't count. But here's why COVID does not fit:\n\nPeople say COVID passports stop you from buying and selling if you don't submit to get the vaccine. But you can still buy anything online and most everything offline like groceries. You may also have to change jobs. When you don't have the mark, you can buy or sell nothing. You starve. Quite different! More importantly, the mark is first and foremost about submitting to worship of the Beast as God; not about the ability to trade, which is a benefit to that worship. Vaccines have no such component of a person you must worship as God. The mark is put on the skin of the forehead or hand (Rev 20:4). Vaccines are injected under the skin typically in the shoulder and are not at all an identifying mark related to the beast's name or 666.\n\nSo you see, the only way to make a vaccine or its passport fit the mark of the beast is to ignore the most important characteristic of the mark. That's not good exegesis. A theory for the mark must fit all the details given on it, not just one.\n\nWhat Do I Think the Mark Is?\n\nThen what is my pick for the mark? In short, it's something we have not seen yet because the power of the mark is beyond our comprehension today. I say that because when you consider the Mark of the Beast verse, it's not so simple as people understand it, such as a cashless society.\n\nRev 13:17 \u2014 so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark: the beast\u2019s name or the number of his name.\n\nConsidering that verse you can rule out a few things right off:\n\nThe mark is not mainly a currency: It always seemed odd to me that the mark was needed for selling, not just buying. If the mark were simply a new currency that everyone must adopt, there is no need to mention \"selling.\" You don't need currency to sell; you only need currency to buy as the seller receives currency from the buyer. (That's another reason why Bitcoin/cryptocurrency does not fit the mark.). So I rule out \"only currency\" off of that.\n\nIt always seemed odd to me that the mark was needed for selling, not just buying.

(That's another reason why Bitcoin/cryptocurrency does not fit the mark.). So I rule out \"only currency\" off of that. The mark is not (only) identification : I've used to think of the mark as an identification required to do (digital) commerce. Much like how a credit card number is needed for online purchases. Cash only works in person; you can't slide it into your PC or phone to buy something online. In fact, you could say \"no one can buy or sell [on the internet] unless he has a credit/debit card.\"\n\n: I've used to think of the mark as an identification required to do (digital) commerce.

In fact, you could say \"no one can buy or sell [on the internet] unless he has a credit/debit card.\" Is trade/bartering stopped, too?: What I also ask myself is can you get away with trade and bartering without the mark? If the mark is only an ID/currency account, then I doubt trade/bartering by people without the mark can be stopped. How powerful is it then and why mention its part in (some) economic transactions? I tend to think that the power policing and enforcing the mark will make it absolutely required to buy or sell anything just as the simple words imply. If it's that powerful then a simple digital technology like a chip does not really do it justice.\n\nWhat I also ask myself is can you get away with trade and bartering without the mark?

If it's that powerful then a simple digital technology like a chip does not really do it justice. Beast UBI? With the talk these days \"universal basic income\" (UBI) or a default minimal income for all citizens from the government, I wonder if the mark won't tie into something like that. Given the world will be devastated for the Antichrist to come to power, a UBI might be needed for people to survive while the economy rebuilds using the supernatural/nephilim help of the Antichrist. Perhaps the mark will be tied to your UBI (Univeral Beast Income) and the currency it is issued in and the account you depend on for any commerce.\n\nAll that to say, when I consider the buying/selling power of the mark and the power of the Beast behind it, I lean towards the mark being like nothing we have seen today. To compare it to optional, voluntary, technologies like credit cards, chips, RFIDs, and the like, to me, vastly underestimates what Revelation is trying to convey about the mark and its necessity to commerce under the Beast.\n\nWhat To Do Today To Escape the Mark\n\nClearly, every believer prefers to avoid ending up in that no-win situation of having to choose between martyrdom and markdom. We all want choice 3: neither! To have that option, the challenge at that point of no return will be in having the discernment to recognize which way God is leading; \"should I stay or should I go?\" Even if you do recognize the truth spoken by God's prophets on leaving, you will also need the faith to go ahead with the minority in following such radical and hard instructions.\n\nThe question, then, is how do we develop the faith and boldness needed to take the hard early action required to avoid the mark? Jesus gave us the clearest advice I know:\n\nLuke 18:8 (HCSB)\u2014 I tell you that He will swiftly grant them justice. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find that faith on earth ? Luke 17:5-6 (HCSB) \u2014 5 The apostles said to the Lord, \u201c Increase our faith .\u201d 6 \u201cIf you have faith the size of a mustard seed,\u201d the Lord said, \u201cyou can say to this mulberry tree, \u2018Be uprooted and planted in the sea,\u2019 and it will obey you. Luke 21:36 (ESV) \u2014 But stay awake at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.\u201d\n\nEver notice that nowhere in the Gospels can you find Jesus directly answering the question of how one increases their faith? I was frustrated at that for a while when I was wanting more faith, like the apostles. Finally, I realized that the Bible gives us the answer elsewhere and everywhere.\n\nIn the many stories of the Bible, we see God's servants walking prayerfully with him through hardships and learning several things in the process. They learn how to recognize his hand leading. This normally does not consist of voices, dreams, and visions, but of coincidences or \"God-incidences\" or \"open doors\" (Rev 3:8, 20) and \"closed doors\" (Rev 3:7). They learn what he is likely to do or lead us to do and what he is not likely to do nor lead us to do. They learn how to trust him when the situation looks like he has abandoned them and just wait in patience and peace until the clear direction to act comes if any action is required. In other words, they learn faith and how to act on it.\n\nIf you pray daily about having faith and strength as Jesus instructed, then you can be sure that God will hear that prayer according to his will. In response, he will direct you just as he did the servants in the Bible who wanted the same thing. You will be put in sometimes uncomfortable situations like they were which require you to be bold and radical at times, and to be inactive or meek at other times; the whole gamut. This will prepare you for all situations including the coming crisis of decision over leaving your home country early enough to escape the Mark of the Beast.\n\nBy the way, as far as finances and other logistics, when the time to escape comes, God has a plan to give provision to all those who choose in faith to obey the command to escape. See my article on the faith to escape to understand that situation.\n\nWhat Not To Do...\n\nLastly, a warning: Emigration to Israel for non-Jews is generally not possible today. The way must be opened up, not just for our move, but several end-time events also require a major change in Israel. For example, the construction of the Third Temple or the sealing of the 144,000 on the Temple Mount can't happen today without Arab control of the Temple Mount being eradicated. I expect the prophesied M.E. nuclear war against Israel where Damascus is laid waste to bring that about.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Mark of the Beast is going to be far more irresistible than most Christians can imagine. But the solution to its challenge is not to get distracted today by trying to figure out exactly what it is in advance. Even if you did figure that out, it would do you no good. If you see the mark, it will already be too late to escape it with your life intact.\n\nThe proper escape plan will instead require faith and proactive, radical action. Unfortunately, as Jesus insinuated, faith will be a rare trait in the end times (Lk 18:8). Further, you do not learn bold and radical action by just going to church every Sunday and listening to your pastor. The answer is to follow Jesus' advice to stay awake and to pray daily for \"the strength to escape what is coming\" (Lk 21:36). God will be sure to answer that prayer by guiding your life so that you get the experiences and information which will develop the faith and radical streak you will need when the time comes. What's more, these two things will help you to serve God and shine your light even better every day along the way, just like the faithful maverick Jesus did.\n\nFor help on what aspects to focus on changing in your life, from Jesus' words, see my article on Rapture Requirements.\n\nP.S.

        "Delta Force Operators Monday morning intercepted an 18-wheeler packed with pistols and bound for the Internal Revenue Service Building in Washington, D.C., a source in General David H. Berger\u2019s office told Real Raw News.\n\nHours after Kabula Harris\u2019s tie-breaking vote on the regime\u2019s climate, health, and tax bill empowered the IRS to hire and arm 87,000 new agents\u2014to the tune of $80bn\u2014an inconspicuous tractor trailer departed a government-leased warehouse in Jessup, Maryland. The obsidian cab and attached trailer swerved through the city\u2019s industrial district and was preparing to veer onto the Baltimore-Washington Parkway when it met an obstacle: four SUVs, each as black as the trailer, blocked its path, two on the road and one on each shoulder. Under ordinary circumstances, the trailer could\u2019ve steamrolled the blockade. But these were not ordinary circumstances. Behind each SUV stood four men garbed in military attire, every one of them brandishing rifles aimed at the cab\u2019s windshield.\n\nAs the truck screeched to a halt, four of the 16 Delta Force Operators approached and commanded the driver and passenger to show their hands and exit the vehicle. They complied and were gagged and zip tied, then pushed into the lead SUV. Wordlessly, two Operators climbed aboard the now seized cab and keyed the ignition. Within seconds, the vehicles had dispersed. The intercept and seizure had taken only minutes to complete.\n\nThe tractor trailer had left Maryland at 2:00 a.m. and, under current traffic conditions, been scheduled to arrive in D.C. no later than 4:00 a.m. By then, however, Special Forces had driven the trailer to safehouse/warehouse they had prepared in advance, and were already inventorying the load against a shipping manifest found in the cab.\n\nAccording to the manifest, the trailer held 23,500 crated Sig Saur P229s and 160,000 rounds of .40 caliber ammunition, ostensibly intended for the IRS\u2019s enhanced police force.\n\nA week before the seizure, U.S. Army Cyber Command had intercepted communications between IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, Chuck Schumer, and Joe Manchin. Rettig had said on a conference call that \u201cthe purchase has been made,\u201d which caused a somewhat agitated Schumer to inadvertently expose the nature of the shipment. \u201cWhy now? You were supposed to wait until we passed the bill and its made law. You jumped the gun, and mean that literally and figuratively, and this could come back at us,\u201d Schumer said. Manchin bowed out of the conversation, saying, \u201cI really don\u2019t need to hear any of this,\u201d and disconnected. But Schumer and Rettig bantered on. \u201cWe know the bill will pass muster, Kamala will see to it. It isn\u2019t a problem. We\u2019ll just say later on that we bought the guns after the bill got passed and ratified,\u201d Rettig blabbered. \u201cDon\u2019t take possession until Biden makes it law,\u201d Schumer said, to which Rettig blurted, \u201cThey can\u2019t sit where they are that long, too risky. I\u2019m moving them here from Maryland storage when it passes. If there\u2019s any blowback, it\u2019ll fall on me.\u201d\n\nU.S. Army Cyber Command at once forwarded a recording of the call to both Marine Corps General David H. Berger and a Delta Force commander whose name remains classified. Together, they greenlit a mission to confiscate the IRS\u2019s would-be arsenal. Research revealed that the federal government had contracts with several shipping and warehouse facilities in the Maryland area, and Delta Force Operators soon began surveillance on those locations, hitting pay dirt rather quickly. The Jessup warehouse, they discovered, was guarded by a throng of treasury agents whose blue windbreakers with IRS Special Agent stenciled on the back conspicuously betrayed their identities.\n\nDelta Force had a choice to make: raid the warehouse and risk a firefight, or continue surveillance until the warehouse\u2019s contents had been loaded onto a trailer, and seize it enroute to its destination.\n\nAccording to our source, Delta Force had watched treasury agents fill the trailer with rectangular wooden crates, the contents of which had been stamped in blank ink on the wood\u2014pistols, lots of them, and ammo.\n\n\u201cDelta expected security would go with the truck, but it was only the driver and one IRS agent in the passenger seat. No tailing vehicles. The IRS is an enemy of the people, and those pistols\u2026why would they need them? Think about that? This is victory but a small one because they have $80bn to play with.

        "On Wednesday 22 June 2022, the United Kingdom declared a national incident after vaccine-induced poliovirus was found in sewage samples in North and East London. Wild polio currently exists in only two countries\u2014Pakistan and Afghanistan\u2014and was declared eradicated in the UK in 2003. We are told that positive sewage tests have been found since February 2022, which would suggest that scientists are looking at a hypothesis of \u2018ongoing transmission\u2019 around the country.\n\nBut is polio the only unusual virus detected in the UK in the last six months, and was it entirely unexpected? Is it sheer coincidence that our very own MHRA is collaborating with the World Health Organisation's Polio Eradication Initiative and houses its polio laboratory at the heart of Britain's medicines regulation complex, at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation?\n\nNot surprising\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), in a March 2019 blog post written when the agency was still designated as Public Health England, warned that a resurgence of Victorian diseases was expected\u2014and that is exactly what we appear to be seeing now, according to current press releases. Professor Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, describes what we are seeing as \u2018chatter\u2019. \u2018Chatter\u2019 is the term regularly used by counter-terrorist officers (a not insignificant context, given that the UKHSA\u2019s new name combines the concepts of public health and national security) to describe the small signals that may signify some more major calamity on the horizon. Infectious disease prevention works in much the same way as counter-terrorism. Currently, we are being alerted that \u2018chatter\u2019 is getting louder; perhaps this increased volume stems from the heightened awareness of the risks since Covid-19. Even though we have seen the world strengthen its security systems, the world\u2019s best-known public health official, Professor Anthony Fauci, warns of a new \u2018pandemic era\u2019.\n\nScabies, rickets, scarlet fever, whooping cough, tuberculosis and typhoid fever, amongst others, are returning to Western nations\u2014but not as we remember them. Some of these old terrors will return with a vengeance, as a new variant or strain. Will our old-fashioned belt-and-braces medications that we have come to rely on for so long be effective, if they even prove to be widely available? What is driving the spread of new, old and existing viruses\u2014or is it simply that we are searching every corner of the planet expecting to track down the next pandemic\u2014a case of seek and ye shall find? Perhaps we should brace ourselves, as the blame for resurgent infections is likely to be attributed in public discourse to a variety of reasons: climate change, population growth, rainforest destruction, intense farming, the increased trade in wildlife combined with the exponential rise in zoonotic disease.\n\nAs the United Kingdom has been extricating itself from the European Union, non-EU immigration has increased, with large numbers of people travelling to and from Africa and Asia. Despite a couple of years of draconian travel restrictions and Covid lock-ups (sic), travel is still always named as the biggest driver of disease importations. The recent outbreak of monkeypox has been linked to Nigeria, with many more cases attributed to music festivals, adult saunas and orgies around the world. The 2022 British polio outbreak is thought to have been derived from another country, one which still uses a vaccine containing a live weakened strain of the polio virus; this is why the health authorities are describing the strain of poliovirus that they have detected in London as \u2018vaccine-derived\u2019. The UK itself has not used this particular vaccine, the Sabin oral vaccine, since 2004; we have reverted to the injectable Salk vaccine for our polio immunisations.\n\nMany would care to argue that polio has been given the perfect opportunity to reappear due to the Covid-19 pandemic, because of increased vaccine hesitancy and a major shift towards funding Covid-19 campaigns at the expense of other precious public health resources. Furthermore, disruptions to normal childhood immunisation schedules due to lock-ups, and a failure to provide face-to-face appointments with health professionals, will no doubt have contributed to the opportunity for polio. In the UK, vaccine administration to children has decreased in the past couple of years, especially in parts of London.\n\nOver-informed\n\nPharmaceutical research is currently travelling at a million miles an hour, with \u2018information cascades\u2019 bubbling with details of the thousands of novel drugs currently in development. This massive volume of information is designed to confuse and overwhelm the general population. As genomic medicines travel down the brand new experimental pipeline at the speed of light, many will relax and participate in clinical trials from the comfort of their armchairs, and millions will come to expect and to rely on brand new drugs which will be delivered in record speed to their door (probably by drone). The norm will be a much shorter delay between demand and delivery. The 100 Days Mission announced by Britain, the vision of Sir Patrick Vallance and Melinda Gates, would appear to be the answer. To put that into context, until 2020 a clinical trial would take years in three back-to-back phases, up to a timescale of 3,652 days. The first Covid vaccine was delivered in 300 days.\n\nGeneric medicines that the majority of us are used to will start to disappear from pharmacy shelves. Novel \u2018super-smart\u2019 genomic medicines will replace them at alarming speed\u2014but at what cost to our health? Does anyone supplying them actually care? Looking at the serious adverse reactions thus far, it seems not.\n\nThe new buzzphrase that we will have to get used to will be antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Fortunately for Britain, we have our very own UK Envoy for AMR, in the form of Dame Sally Davies, Master of Trinity College, Cambridge\u2014England\u2019s previous Chief Medical Officer, who was responsible for Generation Genome.\n\nWhat is AMR anyway, and should we be concerned? According to the World Health Organisation, AMR occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change over time and no longer respond to medicines, making infections harder to treat and increasing the risk of severe illness and death. As a result of drug resistance, antibiotics and other antimicrobial therapies become ineffective, making infectious diseases impossible to treat. The world has neglected to research new antibiotics. Is that an oversight or a deliberate omission at a high level?\n\nWith no new antibiotics riding to our rescue in this heralded pandemic era, many will find themselves reliant on new experimental heavy-duty cocktails. Those wishing to opt out of the new pharmaceutical armoury that is offered to them will undoubtedly move away from allopathic medicine entirely and opt for alternative naturopathic remedies. New variants of concern, mutants and more virulent viruses will call for super-smart medicine\u2014but not necessarily super-smart patients or super-smart medics.\n\nBut ultimately, where does that leave us all? What to expect next\u2014Marburg, polio, typhoid, Ebola, Nipah, or perhaps a combination of several? Could we be about to see the elusive Disease X that experts have been warning of? Time will tell. Pandemics create panic and pandemonium; they can even open Pandora\u2019s box.",
        "We publish the below anonymously for self-evident reasons.\n\nI wrote an article for UK Column a year ago which accused legacy media newspaper proprietors of being criminally negligent for allowing Covid disinformation and fear-based propaganda in their titles.\n\nSince that time, levels of hatred have increased against journalists who operate in this industry that I myself have been part of for a quarter of a century.\n\nIn this second anonymous whistleblower account of what it is like to work in UK newspapers during the Covid era, I hope to direct some of that hatred away from the journalists and to refocus it on the newspaper industry chiefs who serve Big Pharma before truth.\n\nCensorship? What censorship?\n\nNearly all of the journalists I know are completely unaware of global censorship; they are often new in their roles and are thrust into a working world of increasingly aggressive public relations officers.\n\nOne community reporter, whom I class as a friend, listened to my concerns about tech giants censoring scientists and health professionals who went against World Health Organisation guidelines for the alleged pandemic. This reporter\u2019s wages are paid for by Facebook, so I was expecting they would be aware of this, but they responded with: \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAdd to this ignorance the chronic levels of understaffing we endure, with redundancies being announced most years across all editorial departments, and we have an industry where press releases are pumped out without challenge.\n\nAs an example of this, I had one editor ask me to upload directly onto our newspaper website an NHS press release urging pregnant women to take the Covid injection, as it was \u201csafe and effective\u201d. This same editor was too fearful to return to the office early this year, even though others were coming back in, so I genuinely believe the editor thought the press release was nothing more than legitimate public health advice.\n\nIn sum, the entire backbone has been ripped out of the news industry\u2014and that happened more than a decade ago.\n\nAnd we are dealing with clueless individuals who work within it, many of them programmed to be \u201cwoke\u201d by their \u201ctrusted\u201d news sources like the BBC and the Guardian, but do they deserve our hate and scorn?\n\nAt the time of writing my last whistleblower account, I was angry, frustrated and scared about where the world was heading and how my industry was pushing it there. I hated my colleagues for their ignorance and their blind faith in authority.\n\nBut after another year of continuing to take pay cheques from what I still believe is the PR unit for globalist billionaires, I have become sorry for these foot soldiers who have caused so much harm by failing to challenge authority. And I fear for them as well.\n\nBewitched\n\nIt won\u2019t be long before a British journalist is physically hurt (if it hasn\u2019t happened already) for their role in what has happened in the Covid era, and I have experienced some of this public hatred towards journalists myself.\n\nDuring a recent public meeting highlighting the documented life-changing harm and death caused by the Pfizer Covid injections, I had some audience members turn on me, shouting that I was a disgrace and that I should quit my job when I announced that I worked in the mainstream media.\n\nIf it had not been for a senior local politician, who knows me, speaking up for my integrity, I would have had to have made a sharp exit for my own safety.\n\nThe mainstream news has become one of the country's most hated professions during the last two years, especially among those who have either recently learned or already knew not to trust authority on global issues.\n\nHaving now returned to the office on a sporadic basis, I have had the chance to speak face-to-face with colleagues for the first time in more than a year\u2014and it has dawned on me how ignorant they are. They are not stupid, they are not controlled opposition, they are not just being told what to write, they are just completely unaware of any counter-narratives about Covid.\n\nThey are under a spell, a spell of remarkable simplicity that has just two elements\u2014censorship and propaganda\u2014which brings about the end product of fear.\n\nMost of my colleagues are fairly low down in the editorial structure of the global mainstream behemoth, but they represent a microcosm of what is happening further along the corridors of power. This hierarchical consideration goes some way to explain the absolute ignorance among those reporting the news.\n\nThere is a handful of my colleagues who are aware that the human race is being railroaded into a new world order controlled by technocrats. A few others are starting to realise that politicians have no problems lying to us about the most important global issues.\n\nThis second group, although aware of something bad happening around them, recoil at the thought of a global conspiracy to enslave humanity. When discussing Covid, especially, they make it clear they do not subscribe to conspiracy theories and are not conspiracy theorists.\n\nThese comments are made because they are fearful their reputations could be harmed by discussing Covid through the lens of holding authority to account, following the money, and asking who benefits. I have noticed that mainstream media managers are far more fearful of being branded a \u201cconspiracy theorist\u201d than a reporter. And I know of one reporter who was branded the \u201coffice conspiracy theorist\u201d for writing an article detailing a woman\u2019s Covid injection harm.\n\nSome of my colleagues I also count as friends, and many of them I still have not seen since our offices were shut down across the country more than two years ago.\n\nBut recently we have been returning to our desks\u2014which we have to book online beforehand\u2014and this has allowed me to be able to speak to some of them and to look them in the eye as I hear their thoughts about what has been going on.\n\nIt has been a shocking experience, and disheartening. The propaganda pumped out by the Government, and regurgitated by the national newspapers and television news networks, has done a good job of scaring them\u2014to such an extent that real psychological trauma has been caused to some of them. Several colleagues have admitted to me they are \u201cpro-vax\u201d and are worried about any \"messaging\" that could reduce Covid injection uptake. Another just felt it was their \u201ccivic duty\u201d to receive all their injections, and thought no more about it. One colleague even messaged me to urge me to be injected, as they were so worried for my wellbeing.\n\nSome months later, I provided that colleague with evidence from the Office for National Statistics of the increased levels of death among those who did get injected, and I urged them not to continue taking any Covid boosters offered. I received no response.\n\nCloud of unknowing\n\nMore shocking examples of ignorance came from a colleague who told me how fortunate it was that a reporter we worked with had been triple injected, as they had become seriously ill with Covid. No connection between the injections and becoming ill was made.\n\nThis same colleague had written an opinion piece some months earlier, pleading with people to continue taking their Covid injections, despite referencing a report of a woman dying in agony from blood clots\u2014after being injected\u2014which featured in that same day\u2019s newspaper. Is this cognitive dissonance? Mass formation? I don\u2019t pretend to know, but it is isolating and lonely to be working among these people who are so programmed by the television news. And they certainly do not like be challenged about their beliefs. I have done it, and have been victimised for it.\n\nOne seasoned reporter who prided themselves on knowing the ways of the world was talking to me about the alleged pandemic. I asked them what they knew about midazolam, and they replied they had never heard of it.\n\nThis censorship in the legacy media has left my colleagues and former colleagues blissfully unaware of Covid counter-narratives. Some truly believe in Bill Gates as a charitable benefactor for humanity and Chris Whitty as a responsible scientist looking to help guide the UK out of troubled waters.\n\nThey are living in a different reality to myself and do not want to dip their toes in the information streams of those who disagree with them so fundamentally. As one colleague recently told me, they only get their information on global affairs from the mainstream media. I told her I didn\u2019t get any of my information on global affairs from the mainstream media.\n\nThe conversation ended there. We were both so wrapped up in our own worlds that to even engage in debate with someone who thought so differently would be too uncomfortable.\n\nThese types of people who build their understanding of the world from the television, radio and mainstream newspapers do not just work in the mainstream media. They exist in health, education, politics, councils, entertainment, sport, church, you name it. Whatever the sector of employment, there are people who trust those with the loudest microphones.\n\nBut in the mainstream news, there are more of these people; a lot more. Careers in this industry depend on consuming other mainstream outlets: especially so at a local level, where \u201cnews sense\u201d is guided by what the national news is saying.\n\nVictims\n\nSo here I am, a journalist of 25 years who has worked only in the mainstream news arena. I have been unable to wake up the vast majority of colleagues and have withdrawn into my shell, apart from occasional spats with them over e-mail or, on rare occasions, in person.\n\nI know what is going on in the world and they don\u2019t. I have been restricted from writing about what I know about, or even to ask questions of authority that my editor does not want asked.\n\nI am not giving up, though; I am not walking away. I am staying at my post, as I know things are very likely to get worse; and when things get worse, more of my colleagues will start waking up, and I\u2019ll be here to guide them and point them towards official documents that they will know nothing about, since the national newspapers and the broadcast news have chosen to ignore them. Ask a journalist about what they know about PCR test cycle rates or a SPI-B Government document recommending the use fear-based propaganda in the media to turn civilians against each other, and you will just get a blank stare.\n\nA friend consoled me recently that the way to bring down an edifice of unchecked control that operates under the power of censorship and propaganda is to set just one mouse gnawing away at the foundations.\n\nEventually, that one mouse becomes two, and then four, then eight, and so on. That is how we get out of this mess, from the bottom of whatever corporate pyramid we operate in. There is no point in hoping for change from above: as I can tell you with absolute certainty, and experience, it is not coming. Journalists whom I work with, trust, and respect, and have known for years are just as clueless about Covid now as they were at the start of 2020.\n\nDon\u2019t hate them; feel sorry for them. They are victims in all this.\n\nI concluded my last UK Column article with a plea: a plea to those who made the editorial decisions, to allow for debate. That plea was never answered, but I make another plea now, to the reporters, to those venturing out of the office to speak to those in authority, building contacts and getting the stories. (And above all else, keep an open mind.) My plea is this:\n\nPlease, please, do not be afraid of asking difficult questions, and make it your business to seek out information that is being censored and then to decide for yourself whether that information has any validity.\n\nThe fight against tyranny has to come from the bottom, not the top. Don\u2019t wait for a knight in shining armour; there isn\u2019t one coming. It is up to you\u2014the coalface journalist\u2014to get out there and hold authority to account. And then, perhaps, our industry will become less hated than it is today; it could even become a profession again.",
        "It\u2019s April 2020, and since March, the UK has swiftly commissioned and built vast, temporary, intensive care hospitals, in readiness for a predicted epidemic number of severe COVID-19 cases.\n\nThey are called NHS Nightingale Hospitals, and to date there are seven of them, either open or planned. The first one was announced on 24 March by the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, and was opened almost immediately on 3 April at the London Excel Centre. It has a capacity of some 4,000 beds. The other temporary field hospital sites are in Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Bristol, Exeter, Harrogate, and Washington.\n\nAdditionally, over the last month, some 8,000 beds in private hospitals have been re-assigned for Covid-19 use, along with other NHS beds in hospitals all over the UK. By the beginning of April, one third of all non-ICU NHS beds had been converted into potential ICU beds for possible Covid-19 patients. Yet, by 12 April, the London Nightingale had treated just 19 patients, and to date, only 41 patients have been treated.\n\nThis sudden blitz is both unusual and unprecedented. We regularly have seasonal infectious illnesses spread throughout the population; in fact in recent years, some of these epidemic diseases were also predicted well in advance. Yet no new mega-hospitals, temporary or otherwise, were ever built to cope with them, nor were they seen to be needed. Why now?\n\nAccording to the King\u2019s Fund, over the last thirty years, the number of ICU beds has declined, at a time when the population has risen. Over that period, around 34% of general and critical care beds in England have been lost.\n\nPeter Donaghy, an independent data analyst, reports that the UK now comes near the bottom of the world league in the number of hospital beds per head of population: in 2019, and across the four UK nations, he found that there are about 5.7 ICU beds per 100,000 of the population [interpolation of his figures mine]. Cyprus has double that number, Germany has 29, the USA 34, and even Kazakhstan and Mongolia do better than the UK.\n\nBed shortages are not news, however. In 2008, it was revealed that 32,000 beds of all types had been cut in the decade since 1997, when, ironically, the Blair government came into power on a ticket of increasing the number of hospital beds.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2017 there were 70,000 fewer intensive care beds in the UK:\n\nIn 2016, the Royal College of Surgeons had complained of chronic bed shortages, so much so that the occupancy rates had gone beyond 89%, when 85% is considered the maximum safe level. This complaint was made just before the British Medical Association chimed in, reporting on the shortage of beds being more severe than in other Western countries, and that such overcrowding can lead to the spread of infections.\n\nAnd in 2018, the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine (FICM) astonishingly reported that across the UK, 80% of intensive care units were sending patients to other hospitals, either because of a lack of beds or a shortage of staff, particularly nurses.\n\nTo cap things off, by 2019, it was being reported by the British Medical Association that ICU beds had begun to be used for patients recovering from routine operations, and that when more emergency beds were needed, a policy of \u201cescalation beds\u201d came into force. The BMA drily reported that there was \u201clittle sign of this practice ending\u201d.\n\nWhen one thinks of the NHS, intensive care is at the heart of most people\u2019s perceptions of it. Yet the decline in the number of ICU beds over the last 30 years is so counterintuitive that it\u2019s as if some monster deus ex machina has intervened and decided not only that the general numbers of hospital beds are of little import, but that intensive care beds are even more expendable. But whatever the case, in the event of a mass epidemic, the consequences of ICU bed shortages were indeed grim prior to 2020.\n\nWhat official policies have the post-Blair governments been maintaining throughout this decline in the number of ICU beds?\n\nTo get a general feel, looking back to 2011, the government published the UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy Paper, outlining what the official response to a hypothetical pandemic should be.\n\nThis paper appears to have been written largely in response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak. Its precautionary approach stresses that actions following the emergence of a pandemic, which could occur suddenly at any time:\n\nmust be evidence based\n\nbe proportional to the level of threat\n\nbe flexible\n\nbe based on ethical principles.\n\nemergency powers must last no longer than 30 days\n\nSignificantly, it states that during any pandemic, it should be \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d and notes that its recommendations are in line with an earlier, 2007, National Framework paper\u2019s \u201cdefence in depth\u201d approach to a pandemic.\n\nThe Pandemic Preparedness Strategy Paper also makes clear that military personnel are not to be redeployed during a pandemic, but must remain on their normal defence duties. So of course, this means that they were not to be used to help build vast temporary hospitals, transport patients, or manage the public.\n\nMilitary convoy off the coast at Devonport on the morning of 23 March, the day Boris Johnson announced the lockdown\n\nIn fact, the paper is silent on any hospital bed policies; it takes it as read that there would be enough UK ICU beds for the treatment of pandemic disease patients \u2013 for in 2009\u2019s H1N1 swine flu outbreak, generally, hospitals may have just coped with finding enough beds for acute H1N1 patients. There were 540,000 cases of swine flu in England, and 138 fatalities at the time, or 0.026% of those infected.\n\nExercise Cygnus\n\nFollowing the publication of the 2011 preparedness paper, however, the number of ICU beds continued to fall. Then, five years later, government held an unusual and secretive event called Exercise Cygnus.\n\nIt involved all government departments, all local authorities, and the NHS, right across the UK. Its report has not been published for \u201cnational security reasons\u201d and so as not to \u201cfrighten the public\u201d. However, according to those with first-hand knowledge of the operation, Cygnus\u2019 script contained a scenario of a patent lack of capacity in ICU beds and personal protective equipment.\n\nBased on its given hypotheses, it predicted that thousands more critical care beds would be required, large parts of the NHS would need to be switched off to redeploy staff, frail patients would be denied care, and mortuaries would be overwhelmed.\n\nWas this just an experiment to see how the public sector actors involved would react to each other, like some kind of Grand Guignol? Did the exercise take its inspiration from the memorably twisted 2012 London Olympics ceremony, in which rows of thousands of NHS patients in hospital beds, in a dark auditorium looking like a Nightingale Hospital, were danced around by strange beasts and actors wearing scrubs?\n\nThe modelling of Cygnus was done by Imperial College, London, under the aegis of Neil Ferguson, who is also now doing the modelling of Covid-19.\n\nTellingly, it is said that last month\u2019s Coronavirus Act, the emergency legislation which underpins the lockdown, is based on his modelling in Exercise Cygnus. Ferguson\u2019s involvement in the Coronavirus crisis does raise other questions \u2013 for further coverage see Vanessa Beeley\u2019s article: Who controls the British Government response to Covid\u201319?\n\nOutside of the strange artificial world of Exercise Cygnus, the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Surgeons continued to complain about bed shortages. So why was there no turnaround policy introduced at least by 2016 after these professional outcries?\n\nThe Health Secretary at the time was Jeremy Hunt. Simon Stevens was Chief of NHS England. Both had been involved in cutting bed numbers. Yet, since 2016, and prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, with Sir Simon Stevens still at the helm, there appears to have been no general improvement in ICU bed capacity.\n\nFollowing Exercise Cygnus, in 2017, the NHS Board published a short internal paper called Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response (EPRR). Its approach is centred on three Acts of Parliament: the Civil Contingencies Act (2004), the NHS Act (2006), and the Health and Social Care Act (2012).\n\nDrawn up by Director of Operations and Information for the NHS Board, Matthew Swindells (sic), it asks the Board to agree that progress had been made in EPRR over the last year, and that the NHS was in a state of pandemic readiness. EPRR was rubber stamped, but as we have seen above, the somewhat rosy, self-congratulatory picture that was approved by the NHS Board was shown to be completely incorrect by Statista in 2017, and later, by the Faculty of Intensive Care in 2018, the BMA in 2019, and Peter Donaghy in 2020.\n\nBack to Exercise Cygnus. This was supposed to be merely a computer simulation. So why would it be an issue of \u201cnational security\u201d? Why would it \u201cfrighten the public\u201d? Perhaps because it was intended to change the real world into its simulated image?\n\nIt\u2019s an uncanny coincidence that, after the Coronavirus pandemic was declared, it was announced that there were not enough ICU beds or personal protective equipment, that NHS staff have been redeployed to other areas, that hospitalised elderly patients have been denied care through the use of \u201cDo Not Resuscitate\u201d orders, and large, temporary, mortuaries have also been built up and down the country, just as in the simulation.\n\nTemporary mortuary set up in Ernesettle Fort, Plymouth\n\nSince the first reported UK Covid-19 case, there has been non-stop media coverage propagandising the numbers of cases and deaths, and its threat. All the while, there have been regular reports that many ICU beds are empty, that beds of other sorts are empty, and that although accident and emergency visits are down, people with serious conditions telephoning the NHS advice and triage number, are being told to \u201cStay at home \u2013 Save the NHS \u2013 Save Lives\u201d. Many of these callers have then died for lack of care.\n\nIt has also emerged that standards in death registration have been lowered by the government, and that there has been encouragement to register anyone who dies, of any underlying condition, as a Covid-19 death. There need be no objective verification of the existence of Covid-19 to register a death as being caused by it.\n\nDespite these efforts to inflate the death rate, actual mortality rates since the beginning of this crisis do not show that we are in the middle of a pandemic, and actual critical case numbers are not overwhelming the NHS's depleted intensive care units. In that regard, Covid-19 is not mirroring Exercise Cygnus\u2019 computer-generated scenario.\n\nThe government response, however, seems to match it exactly."

        "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nLast Updated on August 5, 2022\n\nThe current Lt. Governor and Democratic candidate for Senate in Pennsylvania, John Fetterman, has been under fire recently for traveling to the Jersey shore in 2020. In the summer of 2020, while Lt. Governor Fetterman was preaching about social responsibility and the need to stay inside and quarantine, he decided that he was exempt from these actions.\n\nNot only did John Fetterman exempt himself from the regulations he enforced on others, he actually took his family on a three-day vacation to Ocean City, New Jersey from June 24-27. Due to his position in the state government, he also brought along state police for protection which costed the PA taxpayers $3500 according to the Washington Free Beacon.\n\nDuring the summer of 2020, The Pennsylvania Department of Health issued multiple guidelines recommending against nonessential travel. Not only did the PA state government issue guidelines against nonessential travel, just days before Fetterman\u2019s travel, there was a spike in cover cases in New Jersey. This prompted Governor Phil Murphy to issue a statement threatening disciplinary action against people coming to the Jersey Shore and not following the covid rules in place.\n\nIn May 2020 Murphy said that \u201crenegade\u201d counties in his state had caused Covid-19\n\noutbreaks by breaking the quarantine orders.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIronically, Fetterman has made carpetbagger accusations against Dr. Mehmet Oz the centerpiece of his campaign. Fetterman has run several ads that accuse Oz of being a New Jersey resident, as the former TV doctor does in fact have a residence in the state.\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon could weigh heavy on the current Senate race, as lockdown policies have proven to be quite unpopular throughout the commonwealth. In 2021, Pennsylvania became the first state in the union to take away their governor\u2019s lockdown powers at the ballot box.",
        "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nLast Updated on August 5, 2022\n\nDr. Kenji Yamamoto, a Japanese cardiovascular surgeon, has penned a letter to the peer-reviewed journal Virology that calls for an end to the COVID-19 vaccine booster program in the country. \u201cAs a safety measure, further booster vaccinations should be discontinued,\u201d Yamamoto wrote. The highly regarded surgeon cited the fact that COVID-19 vaccines have been linked to vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, which has been fatal in a number of patients.\n\nYamamoto works at Okamura Memorial Hospital in Shizuoka, Japan, according to The Epoch Times. In the letter he explains that he and his colleagues have \u201cencountered cases of infections that are difficult to control,\u201d including some that occurred after open-heart surgery and were still not under control after several weeks of treatment with multiple antibiotics.\n\nAccording to Yamamoto, affected patients showed signs of being immunocompromised. For some patients, vaccine-induced side effects proved fatal, the letter explains. In addition, Yamamoto believes the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine has suppressed the immune systems of a number of patients.\n\nThe Japanese surgeon\u2019s move is highly irregular, as doctors don\u2019t often submit opinions that fly in the face of the medical status quo.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn his letter to Virology, Yamamoto cited a Swedish study that reported that eight to nine months after vaccination with two doses, the vaccinated subjects were more likely to contract COVID-19 than their unvaccinated controls. This study also hinted at possible immune-suppression effects as a result of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nVaccine-induced immune disruption is further supported by Israeli and Indian studies that demonstrated an increased likelihood of shingles following COVID vaccination. The Israeli study reported a risk ratio of 1.43, meaning that vaccination raised the risk of developing shingles by 43 percent.\n\nAt the hospital where Dr. Yamamoto works, patients are screened for Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibodies prior to surgeries. Heparin is a drug commonly used to prevent clotting, including during open-heart surgery.\n\nPeople exposed to Heparin sometimes develop antibodies that attack their own platelets, which reduces the available number. The platelets can then clump together as clots, an outcome the drug is supposed to guard against.\n\nYamamoto became alarmed due to the fact that his hospital has seen an unusually high number of positive tests for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibodies since COVID vaccination began, The Epoch Times reported.\n\nAccording to a September 2021 letter published in the journal Thrombosis, Heparin exposure is not the only contributing factor to HIT. The letter found that COVID-19 vaccination can cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia as well. When this condition follows COVID vaccination, however, it is known as vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT).\n\nVITT is one of the few adverse events that vaccine compensation review boards in various countries have acknowledged to be caused by COVID-19 vaccines. While government officials have stressed that the condition is \u201crare,\u201d a large number of individuals who developed it have died.\n\nAccording to Yamamoto, Okamura Memorial Hospital in Shizuoka, Japan has seen several waves of VITT cases since COVID-19 vaccination began.\n\nDue to the increased likelihood of thrombosis, as well as a spike in infections due to suppressed immune function, are two main reasons Yamamoto argues that doctors must record vaccination status prior to performing surgeries. In addition, he has called for the booster program to be halted outright.",

        "As bad as the coronavirus and the COVID-19 sickness it causes are, warning cries are increasing over a much bigger threat with the potential to kill 90% of the U.S. population. And, unlike the virus, Washington has known of the threat for decades and done little to nothing.\n\n\u201cWe have seen this movie before and are living through it now,\u201d said Peter Pry, one of the nation\u2019s leading experts on electromagnetic pulse, the electric grid killer that threatens naturally from the sun and from weapons held by China.\n\n\u201cIf we are not even prepared for the coronavirus, imagine the consequences if we get hit with a real existential threat, like EMP,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvocates for protecting the nation\u2019s electric grid and other vital systems, including military bases, from an EMP attack are seizing on the virus crisis to inject urgency into budgeting to protect electric transformers, transfer stations, and wires from disruption or meltdown.\n\n\u201cFor the $2 trillion that will be spent on the coronavirus, we could harden all critical infrastructures against EMP, deploy space-based missile defense Brilliant Pebbles before the end of a second Trump term, modernize the U.S. nuclear deterrent from top to bottom (delivery vehicles, weapons, scientific-industrial base), and have over $1 trillion to spare,\u201d said Pry, a key member of congressional EMP commissions and author of the new book The Power and the Light: The Congressional EMP Commission\u2019s War to Save America 2001 \u2013 2020.\n\nBrian Sullivan, a government and military security analyst, said, \u201cCan you imagine if our grid went down and we lost electricity for an extended period of time? As bad as our current situation is, it could always be a lot worse. We relied on our government leaders to prepare our country for a pandemic, and we see what that got us. We rely on that same leadership now to protect our electric grid.\u201d\n\nWhile warnings of the current pandemic have been around for less than a year, reports have been written about EMP attacks for decades.

        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nRates of cancer have exploded following the COVID-19 mass vaccination programs, with doctors and scientists all over the world now sounding the alarm.\n\nJust today a reader contacted us with the following tragic story:\n\nSubject: Cancer after Pfizer vaccine Hello, My husband prior to the vaccine was fit and healthy, strong, active. We both had the vaccination on 12.11.2021. about 10 hours kater we spitted first swollen node in his left armpit. Doctors ignored the symptom. Then second node, third\u2026 With 6 swollen nodes he was diagnosed with Mantle cell lymphoma. He\u2019s during very aggressive chemotherapy called Nordic regime. He\u2019s only 36 in May, so he was 35 when it all has started. MCL affects people after 60 usually. Before the vaccination our children brought from school many different viruses, from common flu, tummy bug, chicken pox, ear infections to covid. My husband was totally fine that time. His immune system worked brilliantly during September and October when me and our daughters suffered from mentioned diseases. He was working and taking care of us at that time. If he would have MCL then he wouldn\u2019t be able to fight all these viruses. Everything has changed within the hours from the first dose of Pfizer. At first my husband was ignored by GP as he claimed it was typical side effect which should disappear. When more nodes started swilling gp still claimed we should wait yet in January my husband was advised not to have second dose of the vaccination due to the side effects. In March I requested blood test to check whether it was cancer. Results returned completely fine. I immediately booked next blood test. Also returned completely fine. So without hesitation I booked appointment with go but this time I asked for different gp. During this appointment my husband was referred for ultrasound scan. From there to cancer clinic. 3 days later biopsy took place. Couple if days later we learnt the diagnosis mantle cell lymphoma. At this stage we were told it has nothing to do with the vaccination, yet for months we were expected to wait for side effects to disappear. Also, if the cancer is not in connection to vaccinate then how come my husband survived the 8 waves if different diseases starting from September ? In August we spent holidays in Scotland. Lots of walking and driving. My husband was in a very good shape. Let me say it again, prior to the vaccination my husband was strong, fit, active and healthy. Our life as a family has been literally ruined. We cannot go anywhere, we can\u2019t work, my husband us to weak, I have to care for him now and children. We are facing financial difficulties heading to a place where we won\u2019t be able to cover winter bills. MCL is incurable. Only treatable. If we are lucky, we may be back to temporary normality by March/April 2023. MCL comes back. Noone knows when. Second time it hits stronger\u2026 We can\u2019t take girls for holidays, we can\u2019t mix with other people as my husband\u2019s immune system is compromised. I am on standby all the time as I may need to take him to hospital in emergency like it happened already. Most of days we travel to hospital anyway. Sometimes even twice a day. I have never returned to myself after COVID and vaccination. Before I was very active and fit. Now Im not even at 50% of what I used to be. Our children will never be vaccinated!\n\nI did a search in the U.S. government Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) to see how many cases of the most common cancers had been reported following COVID-19 vaccines, and it returned a result of 837 cases of cancer, including 88 deaths, 66 permanent disabilities, and 104 life threatening events. (Source.)\n\nAnd this not an exhaustive list, as I tried to include ALL cancers listed in VAERS, but the database could not handle the query.\n\nI listed the cases by age, and of the 837 cases, 375 of them had no recorded age, although often the age can be found in the description.\n\nSo I put those 375 cases on the first page of the results, and starting on the second page you can see how young some of these cancer patients are following COVID-19 vaccines. (Source.)\n\nIt begins with a 12-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy, followed by many young adults in their 20s.\n\nUsing the exact same search terms for cancer, I then searched ALL FDA-approved vaccines for the previous 30 years and found only 140 cases of cancer reported. (Source.)\n\nThat result is for 360 months (30 years), whereas the 837 cases following the experimental COVID-19 vaccines were reported in just 20 months, since the roll out of the COVID-19 shots beginning in December of 2020.\n\nThat is an increase of 10,661.4%!\n\nA pathologist who lives in Sweden was just interviewed recently about the increasing rates of cancer she is seeing in her patients following the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nHer name is Dr. Ute Krueger, and the video is found on the Doctors For Covid Ethics Rumble Channel.\n\nThis is an amazing interview! Dr. Krueger is highly credentialed in her field, and yet few of her colleagues are willing to follow where the evidence leads, even though everyone is seeing a huge surge in cancer cases, and her reports to the Swedish Drug Administration have not been addressed. She states:\n\nI studied medicine because I wanted to help people. But now it feels like I am watching people being killed, and there\u2019s little I can do.\n\nThe Expos\u00e9 has also just published an excellent review of some of the scientific literature showing how the spike proteins are interfering with \u201cthe DNA repair mechanism in lymphocytes.\u201d\n\nThe COVID-19 mRNA \u201cVaccines\u201d cause Cancer; here\u2019s the evidence\u2026\n\nby Joel Smalley; Professional Data Analyst\n\nThe Expos\u00e9\n\nThe homologous recombination DNA repair pathway is one of the mechanisms that the body uses to stop your cells turning cancerous in response to environmental stress.\n\nOne of the most important components of this pathway is Tumor protein P53 (p53), the \u201cguardian of the genome\u201d. It protects our cells from cellular damage. Under cellular stress, p53 jumps into action, regulating gene expression to control DNA repair, cell division and cell death. It is the most commonly mutated gene in cancer.\n\nIn October 2021, two revered scientists, called Jiang and Mei, had a paper published, after peer review, in MDPI, showing that the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein obliterated the DNA repair mechanism in lymphocytes.\n\nEffect of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on homologous repair (HR) efficiency in lymphocytes\n\nThe viral spike protein was so toxic to this pathway that it knocked 90% of it out. If the whole spike protein got into the nucleus (in the ovaries), and enough of it was produced and hung around long enough before the body was able to get rid of it all, it would cause cancer. Fortunately, in the case of naturally infection, this is unlikely to occur.\n\nUnfortunately, the experimental mRNA toxshot induces spike protein to be produced (the full length spike exactly matching \u2013 amino acid for amino acid \u2013 the full length of the viral spike protein\u00b9) in and around the cell nucleus\u00b2 and is produced for at least 60 days and almost certainly longer\u00b3.\n\n\u201cFact checkers\u201d said the viral spike protein doesn\u2019t get in the nucleus despite the expert scientists showing that it absolutely does.\n\nConfocal microscopy study showing the spiker protein (green) proliferating the cell nucleus (blue)\n\nPublic health authorities and regulators said the vaccinal spike protein doesn\u2019t get in the nucleus despite the mRNA manufacturers submitting pictures of it doing so to them as part of their emergency use application.\n\nOK, so it gets into the nucleus but the official narrative says it doesn\u2019t stay in the body for more than a few hours. But, a huge study by one of the most respected molecular biology groups in the world at Stanford university\u2074 showed that the mRNA (producing the vaccinal spike antigen) was still present and active in the body after 60 days.\n\nJiang and Mei, quite logically and reasonably, cautioned that the mRNA spike protein would likely have the same effect as the viral spike protein on p53 and therefore cause cancer.\n\nTwo months after this revelation was highlighted by my friend, Jikky the Mouse, the Jiang and Mei paper was retracted due to spurious \u201cexpressions of concern\u201d (EOC) about the methods of the study despite them being standard practice.\n\nMoreover, the authors of the EOC were Eric Freed, the head of the US National Institute of Health (NIH) that funded Moderna, the patent holder of the COVID mRNA toxshot\u2075 and Oliver Shildgen, the actual editor of the journal that originally accepted the paper! And neither of them declared the conflicts of interest.\n\nWell, despite the retraction, the spike protein circulating in large quantities, in the direct vicinity of the cell nucleus, for elongated periods of time, still has the potential to induce cancer in those cells (ovary, pancreas, breast, prostate, lymph nodes). These cancers can take years to develop and so it\u2019s possible that we don\u2019t see much of a safety signal for 5 or 10 years.\n\nSources/References\n\nhttps://sciencebasedmedicine.org/spike-proteins-covid-19-and-vaccines/\n\nhttps://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/foi-2183-09.pdf\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35148837/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8786601/\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/moderna-covid-vaccine-patent-dispute-national-institutes-health/\n\nRead the full article at The Expos\u00e9.\n\nComment on this article at HealthImpactNews.com.\n\nSee Also:\n\nCOVID-19 \u201cVaccine\u201d Casualties List\n\nSee Also:\n\nUnderstand the Times We are Currently Living Through\n\nLeaving a lucrative career as a nephrologist (kidney doctor), Dr. Suzanne Humphries is now free to actually help cure people.\n\nIn this autobiography she explains why good doctors are constrained within the current corrupt medical system from practicing real, ethical medicine.\n\nOne of the sane voices when it comes to examining the science behind modern-day vaccines, no pro-vaccine extremist doctors have ever dared to debate her in public.",
        "by The Expos\u00e9\n\nThe UK Medicine Regulator has confirmed that over a period of nineteen months the Covid-19 Vaccines have caused at least 5.5x as many deaths as all other available vaccines combined in the past 21 years.\n\nThis means, that when compared side by side, the Covid-19 injections are a shocking 7,402% more deadly than every other vaccine available in the UK.\n\nA Freedom of Information request was made via email to the Medicine and Healthcare product Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on the 6th August 2021 in which a Mr Anderson asked the MHRA the following questions \u2013\n\nHow many Deaths have there been from all Covid-19 vaccines?\n\nAre there any other reporting AI system monitoring systems like the Yellow Card scheme?\n\nAre Covid-19 Vaccines still in trials?\n\nHow many deaths has there been in last 20 years by previous Vaccines without Covid-19 Vaccines?\n\nWhat happens if a there is a new vaccine or new drug? What process and monitoring do they go through?\n\nWhat cut off point will the MHRA say a vaccine or drug is unsafe for humans?\n\nThe MHRA responded with the usual \u201cwe do not hold this information\u201d, as seen time and time again from Government departments.\n\nHowever, they did confirm that they are using other epidemiological studies, anonymised GP-based electronic healthcare records and international experience to proactively monitor safety alongside the spontaneous reports received via the Yellow Card scheme.\n\nThe MHRA also confirmed that the current Covid-19 vaccines on offer in the United Kingdom are only under a temporary authorisation and that these authorisations do not constitute a marketing authorisation.\n\nIn answer to the question asked on the number of deaths due to all other vaccines in the past twenty years the MHRA provided the usual robotic response about how great the Covid-19 vaccines are and how they are the \u201csingle most effective treatment for preventing serious illness due to Covid-19\u201d but what they did not do is say that they \u201cdo not hold this information\u201d.\n\nInstead, they revealed that they had received a total of 404 reported adverse reactions to all available vaccines (excluding the Covid-19 injections) associated with a fatal outcome between the 1st January 2001 and the 25th August 2021 \u2013 a time frame of 20 years and 8 months.\n\nBut how does that fare against the number of reported adverse reactions to all temporarily authorised Covid-19 vaccines associated with a fatal outcome?\n\nWell, since the Pfizer injection was rolled out in December 2020 there have been 808 reported deaths as of 13th July 22, meaning that in just 19 months, this \u201cvaccine\u201d alone outnumbers the deaths due to all other vaccines combined in the past 20 years.\n\nHowever, the AstraZeneca viral vector injection has fared much worse with 1,294 deaths being reported to the MHRA since January 2020, more than three times as many deaths as what has been reported due to all other vaccines in the past 20 years.\n\nThere have also been 62 reported deaths due to the Moderna jab since it was first administered in June 2021, and 49 deaths where the brand of Covid-19 vaccine was not specified in the report.\n\nTherefore, up to July 13th 2022, there have been a grand total of 2,213 deaths reported to the MHRA as adverse reactions to all available Covid-19 vaccines in the United Kingdom since the beginning of 2021.\n\nMeaning there have officially been 5.5x as many deaths in just 19 months due to the Covid-19 vaccines than there have been due to every other available vaccine combined since the year 2001.\n\nTwenty years and 8 months is a period that is 13.7 x longer than the nineteen-month period where the Covid-19 vaccines have been rolled out.\n\nTherefore, the number of deaths reported to all other vaccines combined in the same time frame of nineteen months equates to 29.5 deaths.\n\nThis means the Covid-19 injections are proving to be a shocking 7,402% more deadly than every other vaccine available in the UK.",
        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nA recording of a phone call between an irate father and a pharmacist who injected his 7-year-old son with a COVID-19 vaccine after his wife brought him to the pharmacy behind his back, and is now allegedly in the hospital due to myocarditis, has been circulating in the alternative media today.\n\nThe father and his family apparently live in New Zealand, while his work originates in New York, and what is remarkable about the call is that the father asks the pharmacist if parents are warned about the risks to myocarditis and heart disease before giving the COVID-19 shots to children, and the pharmacist replies:\n\nWe might scare the parents, and they don\u2019t want to get their child vaccinated.\n\nThis is on our Bitchute channel, and is also on our Odysee channel and Telegram channel as well.\n\nI found a couple of transcripts of the dialog, and this one (I found it on The Vigilant Fox) seems to be the most complete:\n\nFather: Are you a pharmacist?\n\nPharmacist: Yes, how can I help?\n\nFather: Yeah. Hey, I\u2019ve got a question. My wife, against my wishes, brought my seven-year-old son a few days ago for a COVID jab, and he\u2019s now in the hospital with myocarditis. And I was obviously not very happy with you guys or with my wife. She told me that she was not told that was a potential side effect. So why wouldn\u2019t you have told her that?\n\nPharmacist: Okay \u2014 sorry. So it\u2019s quite a rare side effect as well.\n\nFather: No, it\u2019s not. No, it\u2019s not because I\u2019ve been doing research; it\u2019s common. In the US, there\u2019s tens of thousands of them [myocarditis cases] reported to the CDC site. So why are you not telling parents this?\n\nPharmacist: We might scare the parents, and they don\u2019t want to get their child vaccinated.\n\nFather: So you don\u2019t want to scare the parents with something that is actually happening, that\u2019s happened to my kid? Are you out of your mind? Are you out of your mind? You don\u2019t want to scare them? You need to give them the right information so they can make a proper decision! What is wrong with you? You don\u2019t want to scare them. I\u2019m recording this conversation as well, and this is going to a lawyer next. Thank you for admitting that. So why don\u2019t you tell them? When someone comes in there and says, \u201cHey, what can go wrong?\u201d What do you say? \u201cSore arm\u201d? Have you seen the amount of dead people? Have you seen it?\n\nPharmacist: Has your wife asked before giving consent to give [the child the shot]?\n\nFather: She asked what the side effects are!\n\nPharmacist: She asked? I\u2019m not sure because I wasn\u2019t there.\n\nFather: It doesn\u2019t matter! You\u2019re supposed to tell people this can happen. So you know what the prognosis is? You know what it is? Possible death within five years. 20% of people with myocarditis die! It is a permanent, damaged heart. It is not temporary! He\u2019s facing a heart transplant because of you! Because you didn\u2019t want to scare her! You know no kids have died from COVID, not a single healthy kid, and you\u2019re giving this stuff out, and you\u2019re not warning people? What is wrong with you?\n\nPharmacist: So there are information online that you can look up \u2014\n\nFather: No! No! You gave the shot. When someone comes in there and asks what the side effects are, you don\u2019t NOT say because it might scare them from the shot. What is wrong with you?\n\nPharmacist: So the benefit of getting a vaccination is \u2014 solely giving a vaccination because the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nFather: No, it isn\u2019t! Do you know I\u2019m looking at a Johns Hopkins study? There have been 400 people under 18 die in the United States. 330 million people. Not one of them was healthy. They had cancer, leukemia, obesity, something wrong with them. Not one kid has died or ended up in the hospital. So the benefits are ZERO to my kid! Why did you not tell them? It\u2019s up to you to tell them. Then we make a decision. Not you! You tell us, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s rare, but it happens. You didn\u2019t tell her that, did you?\n\nPharmacist: I\u2019m not sure. I wasn\u2019t the vaccinator \u2014\n\nFather: You said you\u2019re not doing it. So when the next kid walks in there with a mother for a shot, are you going to tell them, \u201cHey, I just got a call from someone; their kid\u2019s heart is destroyed. Keep that in mind; that can happen.\u201d Are you going to tell them that? Are you?\n\nPharmacist: I cannot answer you that.\n\nFather: Well, why can\u2019t you because it\u2019s going to go in a court, and you\u2019ll answer it. You just admitted that you don\u2019t tell people because you don\u2019t want to scare them. It\u2019s recorded; I\u2019ve recorded everything.\n\nPharmacist: Sorry, I wasn\u2019t the pharmacist that did the vaccination.\n\nFather: It doesn\u2019t matter; you just said it! You just said that you don\u2019t tell people.\n\nPharmacist: I don\u2019t know what the situation is, so I don\u2019t know what she told in the vaccination error. I\u2019m not sure. I cannot speak on behalf of the pharmacist that vaccinated.\n\nFather: You just told me you don\u2019t tell people because you might scare them. I have it on a recording. You want me to play it back? Every call \u2014 because I\u2019m in finance \u2014 every call is recorded. Every email I sent is recorded. Every message I sent must be recorded because I work out of New York, and I live in New Zealand. It\u2019s all recorded because the SFC requires it. You are recorded. So you\u2019re telling people \u2014 you\u2019re not telling them they could get damaged, so in case you scare them from taking a shot that can kill them, right? Is that correct? Are you brain dead? What is wrong with you?\n\nPharmacist: Sorry, I don\u2019t think we should con \u2014 continue this conversation.\n\nFather: No, we should because are you going to tell people this is a risk when they come through there? My kid\u2019s screwed! You screwed him. What about everyone else? What are you going to do? You ruined a life! It\u2019s on you for the rest of your life. This kid is screwed because of you because your policy there is to not tell people that these vaccines are dangerous and deadly. Have you seen all the people dying in their sleep? Hundreds of them? Have you seen yesterday? An NFL first-round draft pick, 24 [years old] died? An NBA first-round draft pick died four days ago, dead after the shot. Are you seeing that? Are you sitting there in your bubble collecting your 50 bucks every shot you give, you murderer? So what are you going to do? Are you going to tell parents? Are you going to say, \u201cLook, this is what can happen; it\u2019s not a sore shoulder\u201d? That\u2019s usual, but they can ruin their lives. How do you feel about that you\u2019re ruining lives? Are you going to tell them or not? Are you going to continue to do this?\n\nPharmacist: Um \u2014 that\u2019s not the decision that I make.\n\nFather: It isn\u2019t? So you\u2019re just going to tell people, \u201cOh, nothing can go wrong,\u201d and more kids are going to end up in the hospital with ruined hearts, right? That\u2019s the plan? Because you can\u2019t make that decision. And you\u2019d hate for them not to take the shot, eh? Because then you don\u2019t get your 50 bucks, do you?\n\nPharmacist: So we always ask consent for the parent before we do the vaccinations.\n\nFather: Yeah, but you don\u2019t tell them what can go wrong! Of course, you asked consent. The parent came there with that kid. It\u2019s obvious consent. Why are you not telling them what can go wrong? I\u2019m sure they\u2019re asking. But you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, no. Nothing goes wrong. Just a sore shoulder.\u201d Right? You don\u2019t tell them that the crazy guy called you and said his kid\u2019s life is ruined because of what you did a few days ago. Do you or will you? You are sick! You are sick! You are twisted. You are evil. You\u2019re a monster. You\u2019re wrecking lives. You\u2019re killing babies. You\u2019re killing children. You\u2019re killing mothers. You\u2019re disgusting. Totally disgusting. Do you not see that? You need to at least tell them \u201cThis can go wrong,\u201d because when you don\u2019t, this happens! Don\u2019t you see that?\n\nThe next part is very expletive. I do not agree with the name-calling here, but I do understand the frustration from the parent.\n\nFather: Are you so f*cking stupid? You f*cking murdering bitch! F*ck! And you\u2019re going to continue to do it! \u201cOh, I don\u2019t make that.\u201d You f*cking moron. You are f*cking sick in the brain.

No, it\u2019s not because I\u2019ve been doing research; it\u2019s common. In the US, there\u2019s tens of thousands of them [myocarditis cases] reported to the CDC site. So why are you not telling parents this?\n\nPharmacist: We might scare the parents, and they don\u2019t want to get their child vaccinated.\n\nFather: So you don\u2019t want to scare the parents with something that is actually happening, that\u2019s happened to my kid? Are you out of your mind? Are you out of your mind? You don\u2019t want to scare them? You need to give them the right information so they can make a proper decision! What is wrong with you? You don\u2019t want to scare them. I\u2019m recording this conversation as well, and this is going to a lawyer next. Thank you for admitting that. So why don\u2019t you tell them? When someone comes in there and says, \u201cHey, what can go wrong?\u201d What do you say? \u201cSore arm\u201d? Have you seen the amount of dead people? Have you seen it?\n\nPharmacist: Has your wife asked before giving consent to give [the child the shot]?\n\nFather: She asked what the side effects are!\n\nPharmacist: She asked? I\u2019m not sure because I wasn\u2019t there.\n\nFather: It doesn\u2019t matter! You\u2019re supposed to tell people this can happen. So you know what the prognosis is? You know what it is? Possible death within five years. 20% of people with myocarditis die! It is a permanent, damaged heart. It is not temporary! He\u2019s facing a heart transplant because of you! Because you didn\u2019t want to scare her! You know no kids have died from COVID, not a single healthy kid, and you\u2019re giving this stuff out, and you\u2019re not warning people? What is wrong with you?\n\nPharmacist: So there are information online that you can look up \u2014\n\nFather: No! No! You gave the shot. When someone comes in there and asks what the side effects are, you don\u2019t NOT say because it might scare them from the shot. What is wrong with you?\n\nPharmacist: So the benefit of getting a vaccination is \u2014 solely giving a vaccination because the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nFather: No, it isn\u2019t! Do you know I\u2019m looking at a Johns Hopkins study? There have been 400 people under 18 die in the United States. 330 million people. Not one of them was healthy. They had cancer, leukemia, obesity, something wrong with them. Not one kid has died or ended up in the hospital. So the benefits are ZERO to my kid! Why did you not tell them? It\u2019s up to you to tell them. Then we make a decision. Not you! You tell us, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s rare, but it happens. You didn\u2019t tell her that, did you?\n\nPharmacist: I\u2019m not sure. I wasn\u2019t the vaccinator \u2014\n\nFather: You said you\u2019re not doing it. So when the next kid walks in there with a mother for a shot, are you going to tell them, \u201cHey, I just got a call from someone; their kid\u2019s heart is destroyed. Keep that in mind; that can happen.\u201d Are you going to tell them that? Are you?\n\nPharmacist: I cannot answer you that.\n\nFather: Well, why can\u2019t you because it\u2019s going to go in a court, and you\u2019ll answer it. You just admitted that you don\u2019t tell people because you don\u2019t want to scare them. It\u2019s recorded; I\u2019ve recorded everything.\n\nPharmacist: Sorry, I wasn\u2019t the pharmacist that did the vaccination.\n\nFather: It doesn\u2019t matter; you just said it! You just said that you don\u2019t tell people.\n\nPharmacist: I don\u2019t know what the situation is, so I don\u2019t know what she told in the vaccination error. I\u2019m not sure. I cannot speak on behalf of the pharmacist that vaccinated.\n\nFather: You just told me you don\u2019t tell people because you might scare them. I have it on a recording. You want me to play it back? Every call \u2014 because I\u2019m in finance \u2014 every call is recorded. Every email I sent is recorded. Every message I sent must be recorded because I work out of New York, and I live in New Zealand. It\u2019s all recorded because the SFC requires it. You are recorded. So you\u2019re telling people \u2014 you\u2019re not telling them they could get damaged, so in case you scare them from taking a shot that can kill them, right? Is that correct? Are you brain dead? What is wrong with you?\n\nPharmacist: Sorry, I don\u2019t think we should con \u2014 continue this conversation.\n\nFather: No, we should because are you going to tell people this is a risk when they come through there? My kid\u2019s screwed! You screwed him. What about everyone else? What are you going to do? You ruined a life! It\u2019s on you for the rest of your life. This kid is screwed because of you because your policy there is to not tell people that these vaccines are dangerous and deadly. Have you seen all the people dying in their sleep? Hundreds of them? Have you seen yesterday? An NFL first-round draft pick, 24 [years old] died? An NBA first-round draft pick died four days ago, dead after the shot. Are you seeing that? Are you sitting there in your bubble collecting your 50 bucks every shot you give, you murderer? So what are you going to do? Are you going to tell parents? Are you going to say, \u201cLook, this is what can happen; it\u2019s not a sore shoulder\u201d? That\u2019s usual, but they can ruin their lives. How do you feel about that you\u2019re ruining lives? Are you going to tell them or not? Are you going to continue to do this?\n\nPharmacist: Um \u2014 that\u2019s not the decision that I make.\n\nFather: It isn\u2019t? So you\u2019re just going to tell people, \u201cOh, nothing can go wrong,\u201d and more kids are going to end up in the hospital with ruined hearts, right? That\u2019s the plan? Because you can\u2019t make that decision. And you\u2019d hate for them not to take the shot, eh? Because then you don\u2019t get your 50 bucks, do you?\n\nPharmacist: So we always ask consent for the parent before we do the vaccinations.\n\nFather: Yeah, but you don\u2019t tell them what can go wrong! Of course, you asked consent. The parent came there with that kid. It\u2019s obvious consent. Why are you not telling them what can go wrong? I\u2019m sure they\u2019re asking. But you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, no. Nothing goes wrong. Just a sore shoulder.\u201d Right? You don\u2019t tell them that the crazy guy called you and said his kid\u2019s life is ruined because of what you did a few days ago. Do you or will you? You are sick! You are sick! You are twisted. You are evil. You\u2019re a monster. You\u2019re wrecking lives. You\u2019re killing babies. You\u2019re killing children. You\u2019re killing mothers. You\u2019re disgusting. Totally disgusting. Do you not see that? You need to at least tell them \u201cThis can go wrong,\u201d because when you don\u2019t, this happens! Don\u2019t you see that?\n\nThe next part is very expletive. I do not agree with the name-calling here, but I do understand the frustration from the parent.\n\nFather: Are you so f*cking stupid? You f*cking murdering bitch! F*ck! And you\u2019re going to continue to do it! \u201cOh, I don\u2019t make that.\u201d You f*cking moron. You are f*cking sick in the brain. You are f*cking mentally retarded.\n\nComment on this article at HealthImpactNews.com.\n\nSee Also:\n\nUnderstand the Times We are Currently Living Through\n\nSee Also:\n\nCOVID-19 \u201cVaccine\u201d Casualties List\n\nLeaving a lucrative career as a nephrologist (kidney doctor), Dr. Suzanne Humphries is now free to actually help cure people.\n\nIn this autobiography she explains why good doctors are constrained within the current corrupt medical system from practicing real, ethical medicine.\n\nOne of the sane voices when it comes to examining the science behind modern-day vaccines, no pro-vaccine extremist doctors have ever dared to debate her in public.",

        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) database of adverse drug reactions is now reporting 46,999 deaths and 4,731,833 injuries following COVID-19 vaccines (details below).\n\nIn the United States, the Vaccine Adverse Events Recording System (VAERS) is now reporting 29,790 deaths and 1,357,940 injuries following COVID-19 vaccines. (Source.)\n\nA 2011 report by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Inc. for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) stated that less than 1% of all adverse events following vaccines are ever reported to VAERS.\n\nAlthough 25% of ambulatory patients experience an adverse drug event, less than 0.3% of all adverse drug events and 1-13% of serious events are reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Likewise, fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported. Low reporting rates preclude or slow the identification of \u201cproblem\u201d drugs and vaccines that endanger public health. New surveillance methods for drug and vaccine adverse effects are needed. (Source.)\n\nThere have now been more deaths and vaccine side effects reported during the past 20 months to VAERS following COVID-19 vaccines than there have been for the entire previous 30 years for all FDA-approved vaccines before the Emergency Use Authorization of the COVID-19 shots in December of 2020.

        "by The Expos\u00e9\n\nThe UK Medicine Regulator has confirmed that over a period of nineteen months the Covid-19 Vaccines have caused at least 5.5x as many deaths as all other available vaccines combined in the past 21 years.\n\nThis means, that when compared side by side, the Covid-19 injections are a shocking 7,402% more deadly than every other vaccine available in the UK.\n\nA Freedom of Information request was made via email to the Medicine and Healthcare product Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on the 6th August 2021 in which a Mr Anderson asked the MHRA the following questions \u2013\n\nHow many Deaths have there been from all Covid-19 vaccines?\n\nAre there any other reporting AI system monitoring systems like the Yellow Card scheme?\n\nAre Covid-19 Vaccines still in trials?\n\nHow many deaths has there been in last 20 years by previous Vaccines without Covid-19 Vaccines?\n\nWhat happens if a there is a new vaccine or new drug? What process and monitoring do they go through?\n\nWhat cut off point will the MHRA say a vaccine or drug is unsafe for humans?\n\nThe MHRA responded with the usual \u201cwe do not hold this information\u201d, as seen time and time again from Government departments.\n\nHowever, they did confirm that they are using other epidemiological studies, anonymised GP-based electronic healthcare records and international experience to proactively monitor safety alongside the spontaneous reports received via the Yellow Card scheme.\n\nThe MHRA also confirmed that the current Covid-19 vaccines on offer in the United Kingdom are only under a temporary authorisation and that these authorisations do not constitute a marketing authorisation.\n\nIn answer to the question asked on the number of deaths due to all other vaccines in the past twenty years the MHRA provided the usual robotic response about how great the Covid-19 vaccines are and how they are the \u201csingle most effective treatment for preventing serious illness due to Covid-19\u201d but what they did not do is say that they \u201cdo not hold this information\u201d.\n\nInstead, they revealed that they had received a total of 404 reported adverse reactions to all available vaccines (excluding the Covid-19 injections) associated with a fatal outcome between the 1st January 2001 and the 25th August 2021 \u2013 a time frame of 20 years and 8 months.\n\nBut how does that fare against the number of reported adverse reactions to all temporarily authorised Covid-19 vaccines associated with a fatal outcome?\n\nWell, since the Pfizer injection was rolled out in December 2020 there have been 808 reported deaths as of 13th July 22, meaning that in just 19 months, this \u201cvaccine\u201d alone outnumbers the deaths due to all other vaccines combined in the past 20 years.\n\nHowever, the AstraZeneca viral vector injection has fared much worse with 1,294 deaths being reported to the MHRA since January 2020, more than three times as many deaths as what has been reported due to all other vaccines in the past 20 years.\n\nThere have also been 62 reported deaths due to the Moderna jab since it was first administered in June 2021, and 49 deaths where the brand of Covid-19 vaccine was not specified in the report.\n\nTherefore, up to July 13th 2022, there have been a grand total of 2,213 deaths reported to the MHRA as adverse reactions to all available Covid-19 vaccines in the United Kingdom since the beginning of 2021.\n\nMeaning there have officially been 5.5x as many deaths in just 19 months due to the Covid-19 vaccines than there have been due to every other available vaccine combined since the year 2001.\n\nTwenty years and 8 months is a period that is 13.7 x longer than the nineteen-month period where the Covid-19 vaccines have been rolled out.\n\nTherefore, the number of deaths reported to all other vaccines combined in the same time frame of nineteen months equates to 29.5 deaths.\n\nThis means the Covid-19 injections are proving to be a shocking 7,402% more deadly than every other vaccine available in the UK.",

The virus was initially identified in people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Since then, human cases of monkeypox have been reported in nearly a dozen African nations.\n\nIn reality, monkeypox disease is incredibly rare, has rarely been seen outside of Africa, and indeed never appeared in multiple countries outside of Africa simultaneously.

Add up all the coronavirus shots by the end of the year, and the total might be in the double digits. It is only fair to question whether such a litany of shots will negatively impact the human immune system.\n\nTheoretically, the coronavirus vax is designed to train the immune system to recognize the coronavirus spike protein of the original strain by turning your cells into a spike protein factory, spurring the generation of antibodies for potential use down the line. The immune system is then tasked with battling the virus, yet the vax efficacy ultimately dissipates.\n\nRegardless of the supposed vax mechanism of action, one need not look any further than the data about coronavirus deaths based on vax status to realize that immune deficiency syndrome acquired through the vax has the potential to cause the activation of inactive herpes.\n\nStay tuned as more details about the possible links between the coronavirus jab and other health problems are revealed in the months ahead.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nAssets.publishing.service.gov.uk\n\nExpose-News.com",

        "(NaturalHealth365) The U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has been around for over 30 years. Co-managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), \u201cVAERS is not designed to determine if a vaccine caused a health problem,\u201d explains the Department of Health and Human Services, \u201cbut is especially useful for detecting unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse event reporting that might indicate a possible safety problem with a vaccine.\u201d Such detection will allow public health officials to \u201cfurther assess a possible safety concern\u201d with a given drug, HHS continues, including the mRNA COVID shots.\n\nBut if VAERS is indeed so critical for providing \u201cvaluable information\u201d to public health officials regarding vax safety, then why did the CDC reportedly just admit that it\u2019s not looking at this data at all for these gene-based COVID jabs?\n\nIs the CDC turning a blind eye to glaringly obvious safety signals in the U.S. vax safety passive reporting system VAERS?\n\nIn late June of this year, Children\u2019s Health Defense (CHD) submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the CDC following a bombshell article published on CHD\u2019s website in which Josh Guetzkow, PhD used the CDC\u2019s own methodology to reveal glaring safety signals within the current VAERS data set regarding COVID injections.\n\nAccording to his bio on the Children\u2019s Health Defense website, Dr. Guetzkow is a senior lecturer in the Department of Sociology & Anthropology and the Institute of Criminology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and completed a post-doctoral fellowship at Harvard University in Health Policy Research Program. Unlike many three-letter organizations running this country, Dr. Guetzkow has no financial conflicts of interest to declare.\n\nSafety problems that shook out from the VAERS data, according to Guetzkow\u2019s analysis, included \u201cacute myocardial infarction, anaphylaxis, appendicitis, Bell\u2019s palsy, coagulopathy, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A), stroke, and death.\u201d Yet the CDC, FDA, Fauci, and other officials have continued to deny any such safety problems exist and insist that these shots are overwhelmingly \u201csafe and effective.\u201d How is this possible?\n\nThis question is what prompted CHD to submit the FOIA request. Incredibly, in response to the request, the CDC allegedly admitted that it hasn\u2019t analyzed VAERS data for COVID shot safety signals at all. To explain further:\n\nOne of the CDC\u2019s primary methods for analyzing safety data is a pharmacovigilance calculation known as proportional reporting ratios (PRRs). PRRs compare the number and type of adverse event reports for new vaxxes to the number and type of adverse events for older, more established vaxxes. Safety signals are triggered if the reports of adverse events for new vs. old vaxxes are significantly disproportionate.\n\nYet, in their official response to CHD\u2019s FOIA request, the CDC writes, \u201cno PRRs were conducted by CDC. Furthermore, data mining is outside of the agency\u2019s purview.\u201d\n\n\u201cOutside of the agency\u2019s purview.\u201d This is a blatant lie. In an official document titled \u201cVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS): Standard Operating Procedures for COVID-19,\u201d the CDC\u2019s Immunization Safety Office clearly states that \u201cCDC will perform Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) analysis \u2026 to identify [adverse events] that are disproportionately reported relative to other [adverse events].\u201d\n\nIt seems this egregious oversight explains why \u201cloud and clear\u201d safety signals were found within VAERS by Dr. Guetzkow yet completely missed and denied by Rochelle Walensky and her fellow elitist public health cronies.\n\nCDC dropped the ball \u2013 will further information reveal FDA did, too?\n\nIn addition to VAERS, the CDC and related agencies rely on other sources of information to make their claims about the safety and efficacy of COVID shots, including various CDC-funded studies which utilize the so-called Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), a \u201ccollaborative project\u201d between the CDC and nine health care organizations that uses electronic health data to monitor vax safety. However, concerns have been raised about the limitations and methodological flaws of these studies.\n\nPlus, while data mining with PRRs is imperfect, it is a well-established method that can be used to quickly alert officials to major safety concerns regarding new-to-the-market drugs. It is shameful and bordering on criminally negligent for the CDC to ignore this critical step.\n\nGuetzkow hints that another FOIA request will be coming from CHD \u2013 this one directed to the FDA. Let\u2019s keep an eye out to see whether the administration will be transparent.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nHHS.gov\n\nNIH.gov\n\nCDC.gov\n\nCDC.gov\n\nMedpagetoday.com\n\nChildrenshealthdefense.org\n\nChildrenshealthdefense.org\n\nShouselaw.com",

It is only fair to question whether such a litany of shots will negatively impact the human immune system.\n\nTheoretically, the coronavirus vax is designed to train the immune system to recognize the coronavirus spike protein of the original strain by turning your cells into a spike protein factory, spurring the generation of antibodies for potential use down the line. The immune system is then tasked with battling the virus, yet the vax efficacy ultimately dissipates.\n\nRegardless of the supposed vax mechanism of action, one need not look any further than the data about coronavirus deaths based on vax status to realize that immune deficiency syndrome acquired through the vax has the potential to cause the activation of inactive herpes.\n\nStay tuned as more details about the possible links between the coronavirus jab and other health problems are revealed in the months ahead.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nAssets.publishing.service.gov.uk\n\nExpose-News.com",
        "(NaturalHealth365) Will a COVID-19 vaccine return us to a sense of \u201cnormalcy,\u201d quelling the global pandemic and putting an end to one of the worst years in human history? Or, is it destined to be just another rabbit hole in which roll-out and distribution are a logistical nightmare, negative side effects more common than initially predicted, and where pharma giants make huge profits from free-riding on research carried out by the public sector?\n\nEven worse, thought of by many people, this \u201csolution\u201d could very well be part of a depopulation agenda by the global elite. Whatever you think, there is one simple problem being overlooked \u2013 that we\u2019ll point out today\u2026\n\nAccording to researchers and environmental health scientists, a successful COVID-19 vaccine could be hindered by the widespread contamination of PFAS chemicals found in everyday products. These man-made chemicals, or forever chemicals, have been used in industry and consumer products worldwide since the 1950s and exist in everything from non-stick pans and waterproof clothes to pizza boxes and fast-food wrappers.\n\n\u201cForever chemicals\u201d are inside 99% percent of Americans and can influence the results of a COVID-19 vaccine\n\nOnce hailed as a miracle of modern chemistry, PFAS are now a public scourge and national health crisis, having been linked to liver damage, decreased fertility, and cancer. Scientists are now warning that PFAS might reduce the effectiveness of certain administered vaccines.\n\nCurrently, it\u2019s uncertain if PFAS contamination will disrupt the messenger RNA genetic material in the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. However, research has shown that children exposed to PFAS had significantly reduced antibody concentrations after given tetanus and diphtheria vaccinations. (Why does this matter? Keep reading\u2026)\n\nHow confident should we be in a vaccine? Take this news with a grain of salt\n\nIn a recent press conference, the German company BioNTech and the U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer said that their jointly developed COVID-19 vaccine outperformed expectations in phase 3, proving 90% effective. BioNTech\u2019s CEO even went so far as to say that the vaccine will \u201cbash the virus over the head.\u201d\n\nOn the surface \u2026 this may appear to be positive news. As COVID-19 numbers spike, grim milestones are met (over 250,000 dead in the U.S.) and new lockdowns and restrictions enforced around the world, many people are desperate to see \u2013 and believe in \u2013 \u201cthe light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d\n\nBut the idea that forever chemicals might hinder the effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine casts a (huge) long shadow, and one can\u2019t help but wonder if two \u201cmiracles of modern chemistry\u201d will result in a terrible outcome.\n\nIn critic and essayist Elisa Gabbert\u2019s book on disaster, The Unreality of Memory and other essays, she writes: \u201cMy research into past disasters \u2013 the plagues and the almost nuclear wars \u2013 was often oddly comforting. We\u2019re still here, after all. But I can only take so much comfort in the past. This point in history does feel different, like we\u2019re nearing an event horizon.\u201d\n\nWhat if that event horizon isn\u2019t COVID-19 but the inability to develop a fully effective pharmaceutical \u201csolution\u201d because of the PFAS chemicals we\u2019ve polluted our bodies with? This is exactly the reason why we \u2013 at NaturalHealth365 \u2013 promote (so strongly) the importance of supporting a strong immune system.\n\nThe point is simple: a strong immune system is your best defense against bacterial and viral infections.\n\nFor more SHOCKING information about PFAS, listen to this highly-informative NaturalHealth365 podcast with Jonathan Landsman and environmental attorney, Robert Bilott.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nTheguardian.com",
        "(NaturalHealth365) The U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has been around for over 30 years. Co-managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), \u201cVAERS is not designed to determine if a vaccine caused a health problem,\u201d explains the Department of Health and Human Services, \u201cbut is especially useful for detecting unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse event reporting that might indicate a possible safety problem with a vaccine.\u201d Such detection will allow public health officials to \u201cfurther assess a possible safety concern\u201d with a given drug, HHS continues, including the mRNA COVID shots.\n\nBut if VAERS is indeed so critical for providing \u201cvaluable information\u201d to public health officials regarding vax safety, then why did the CDC reportedly just admit that it\u2019s not looking at this data at all for these gene-based COVID jabs?\n\nIs the CDC turning a blind eye to glaringly obvious safety signals in the U.S. vax safety passive reporting system VAERS?\n\nIn late June of this year, Children\u2019s Health Defense (CHD) submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the CDC following a bombshell article published on CHD\u2019s website in which Josh Guetzkow, PhD used the CDC\u2019s own methodology to reveal glaring safety signals within the current VAERS data set regarding COVID injections.\n\nAccording to his bio on the Children\u2019s Health Defense website, Dr. Guetzkow is a senior lecturer in the Department of Sociology & Anthropology and the Institute of Criminology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and completed a post-doctoral fellowship at Harvard University in Health Policy Research Program. Unlike many three-letter organizations running this country, Dr. Guetzkow has no financial conflicts of interest to declare.\n\nSafety problems that shook out from the VAERS data, according to Guetzkow\u2019s analysis, included \u201cacute myocardial infarction, anaphylaxis, appendicitis, Bell\u2019s palsy, coagulopathy, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A), stroke, and death.\u201d Yet the CDC, FDA, Fauci, and other officials have continued to deny any such safety problems exist and insist that these shots are overwhelmingly \u201csafe and effective.\u201d How is this possible?\n\nThis question is what prompted CHD to submit the FOIA request. Incredibly, in response to the request, the CDC allegedly admitted that it hasn\u2019t analyzed VAERS data for COVID shot safety signals at all. To explain further:\n\nOne of the CDC\u2019s primary methods for analyzing safety data is a pharmacovigilance calculation known as proportional reporting ratios (PRRs). PRRs compare the number and type of adverse event reports for new vaxxes to the number and type of adverse events for older, more established vaxxes. Safety signals are triggered if the reports of adverse events for new vs. old vaxxes are significantly disproportionate.\n\nYet, in their official response to CHD\u2019s FOIA request, the CDC writes, \u201cno PRRs were conducted by CDC. Furthermore, data mining is outside of the agency\u2019s purview.\u201d\n\n\u201cOutside of the agency\u2019s purview.\u201d This is a blatant lie. In an official document titled \u201cVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS): Standard Operating Procedures for COVID-19,\u201d the CDC\u2019s Immunization Safety Office clearly states that \u201cCDC will perform Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) analysis \u2026 to identify [adverse events] that are disproportionately reported relative to other [adverse events].\u201d\n\nIt seems this egregious oversight explains why \u201cloud and clear\u201d safety signals were found within VAERS by Dr. Guetzkow yet completely missed and denied by Rochelle Walensky and her fellow elitist public health cronies.\n\nCDC dropped the ball \u2013 will further information reveal FDA did, too?\n\nIn addition to VAERS, the CDC and related agencies rely on other sources of information to make their claims about the safety and efficacy of COVID shots, including various CDC-funded studies which utilize the so-called Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), a \u201ccollaborative project\u201d between the CDC and nine health care organizations that uses electronic health data to monitor vax safety. However, concerns have been raised about the limitations and methodological flaws of these studies.\n\nPlus, while data mining with PRRs is imperfect, it is a well-established method that can be used to quickly alert officials to major safety concerns regarding new-to-the-market drugs. It is shameful and bordering on criminally negligent for the CDC to ignore this critical step.\n\nGuetzkow hints that another FOIA request will be coming from CHD \u2013 this one directed to the FDA. Let\u2019s keep an eye out to see whether the administration will be transparent.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nHHS.gov\n\nNIH.gov\n\nCDC.gov\n\nCDC.gov\n\nMedpagetoday.com\n\nChildrenshealthdefense.org\n\nChildrenshealthdefense.org\n\nShouselaw.com",

        "(NaturalHealth365) Can you imagine a dystopian world in which zoonotic viruses are used to conceal problems resulting from vaxing people against highly survivable communicable diseases? Take a moment to consider a world where such injections are necessary for employment, education, and other social participation. It appears as though this dystopian reality has quickly become the world we live in. New evidence makes it appear as though monkeypox is a cover-up for immune deficiency syndrome resulting from the jab.\n\nIf the evidence proves accurate, the histrionics concerning monkeypox are unjustified as this isn\u2019t the first monkeypox virus to spread across first-world nations. Rather, it appears as though we are viewing a cover-up of damage inflicted on the immune systems of those who were provided with the coronavirus vax. This damage may be extensive to the point that it resembles Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome.\n\nWhat are the origins of the monkeypox virus?\n\nRewind to the 1970s, and monkeypox was a big deal as this was the point in time when the virus was first identified in human beings. The virus was initially identified in people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Since then, human cases of monkeypox have been reported in nearly a dozen African nations.\n\nIn reality, monkeypox disease is incredibly rare, has rarely been seen outside of Africa, and indeed never appeared in multiple countries outside of Africa simultaneously. This time around, however, we are told of new monkeypox cases in the United States, Europe, Canada, and elsewhere all in unison.\n\nCoincidence? Symptoms of alleged monkeypox similar to listed COVID jab adverse effect\n\nThe symptoms of monkeypox are similar to those of herpes. However, perhaps what is most shocking is that herpes is considered a documented COVID shot adverse event by Pfizer. Though this revelation was made public in the documents published by the FDA earlier this year, the mainstream media didn\u2019t give it much credence.\n\nHerpes symptoms typically include:\n\nMild redness and tingling\n\nSwollen lymph glands\n\nFever\n\nLesions similar to blisters that become sores\n\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that the symptoms of the COVID-19 jab manifest in a form similar to those of monkeypox and herpes, prompting concerned individuals to obtain the monkeypox vaccination when the truth is it is the jab itself that is the root cause of the problems.\n\nHere is how the COVID shot affects the immune system\n\nTurn on the nightly news, and you\u2019ll hear word of variant-specific boosters. The federal government now suggests that Americans receive separate booster shots specific to each unique coronavirus variant. Furthermore, these variant-specific booster shots are in addition to the initial two boosters provided in previous months. Add up all the coronavirus shots by the end of the year, and the total might be in the double digits.

        "(NaturalHealth365) A respected pediatrician is warning parents worldwide that the coronavirus shot is dangerous for kids. Dr. Michelle Perro has helped patients overcome coronavirus complications in the past couple of years. Yet, there is some question about whether the issues were spurred by the shot itself or an actual infection.\n\nIn the case of the coronavirus jab, the truth just might be stranger than fiction. Let\u2019s take a quick look at why more and more medical professionals are growing skeptical of the COVID jab for kids.\n\nNumerous studies confirm dangers of COVID shots\n\nThe uptick in complications after the rollout of the vax program has made it clear that mRNA shots are inherently flawed. Objective individuals will agree that injecting toxic poisons in the form of a never-used-before mRNA shot several times over was not a good idea. However, hindsight is often 20/20.\n\nTo what extent will the jab harm our youngsters who took the jab at the behest of the government, physicians, teachers, and parents? At this stage, numerous studies have confirmed the dangers inherent to the COVID shot, although the long-term risks are still unknown.\n\nIn addition to the toxic injections, children are also exposed to toxins in the air, water, and food supply. Add in increased exposure to the electromagnetic field combined with excessive screen time along with minimal human contact, and you have a recipe for disaster.\n\nToxic components of note\n\nThe attempt to prevent an injury resulting from the coronavirus jab or treat such an injury requires the analysis of certain components of toxicity. According to Dr. Perro, the toxic components in question are as follows:\n\nSpike protein toxicity\n\nPEG\n\nInflammation from the nanolipid\n\nGraphene oxide\n\nNanotoxicity\n\nDr. Perro believes ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine are some of the best ways to offset these toxic threats. In addition, she recommends pine needle tea, NAC, lumbrokinase, zeolite, and curcumin to support the body\u2019s natural ability to heal itself.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Dr. Maurice Hilleman, the previous head of the drug company Merck, who played an essential role in developing polio shots, has spoken out against the coronavirus vax. According to Hilleman, the shot for COVID-19 has the potential to be contaminated.\n\nDr. Hilleman insists the jabs might contain contaminants ranging from various viral pathogens and even simian virus 40, a virus known to cause cancer.\n\nAre nanoparticles a legitimate threat to human health?\n\nDr. Perro has gone out of her way to highlight the use of nanoparticles in the latest jabs. Nanoparticles are tiny particles that have the potential to transition across the vitally important blood-brain barrier.\n\nAccording to Dr. Perro, the nanoparticle movement across the barrier is likely responsible for the spike in problematic neuroinflammation in children and adults. She also questions whether there might be a link between using jabs with nanoparticles and the rise in neurosensitivity and ADHD.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nChildrensHealthDefense.org",

All of these and more are being newly reported in this country among people recently jabbed with the gene-based COVID drugs.\n\nThese are exactly the concerns that health experts have warned about \u2013 let alone the warning that the shots are not preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and may, in fact, make some vax-recipients even more at risk of symptomatic infection.\n\nThe latter point was made in an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine earlier this month, in which researchers discovered that people who received two doses of an mRNA shot had negative protection against symptomatic COVID-19, whereas people who recovered from a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection had about a 50% immunity against future illness.\n\nListen: nobody wants to be sick. And sadly, even things like the common cold and the flu can be serious or even deadly for some individuals \u2013 this is nothing new. To be certain, the same can be said for COVID-19.\n\nBut the reality is that this viral infection has proven to be highly survivable among all age groups. It\u2019s simply not as deadly as the mainstream media wants us to believe (and especially for young children, a demographic that the government wants to be filled with yet ANOTHER round of vaxxes).\n\nSo, why the ongoing push for more and more \u201cbooster\u201d shots, reformulated and modified simply to chase after the next of an unending number of future \u201cvariants\u201d? Is the dependency on Pharma truly that important to normalize \u2013 and are people falling for it?\n\nOne final note: never forget the importance of a strong immune system \u2026 this is a good place to start, especially if you\u2019re concerned about avoiding dis-ease symptoms. If you want to \u201cdive deep\u201d into the topic of immunity, check out the Immune Defense Summit hosted by Jonathan Landsman.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nChildrenshealthdefense.org\n\nChildrenshealthdefense.org\n\nNEJM.org",
        "(NaturalHealth365) As we continue to report on the latest news about the coronavirus epidemic, we\u2019re beginning to realize there\u2019s so much more to 2019-nCoV than mainstream media would have you believe. We only need to start with the virus\u2019s origin story to start pulling back the layers of deception and misinformation.\n\nAs we\u2019ve stated in an earlier article, the prevalent theory has been that the coronavirus began in a wet market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Now, blistering new revelations from an American bioweapons expert shatter this theory and point to a much more sinister beginning for the virus, which has amassed a current death toll of over 800 people.\n\nDeadly virus created in a Wuhan laboratory, says U.S. international law professor \u2013 a laboratory specially designated by the World Health Organization\n\nDr. Francis Boyle is a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law. He holds multiple prestigious degrees, including a doctor of law degree from Harvard Law School and a PhD in Political Science from Harvard University. He\u2019s best known for drafting The Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989.\n\nIn a recent interview published on January 30 to YouTube, Dr. Boyle gave a detailed account of how 2019-nCoV didn\u2019t originate in the wet market of the Hubei province. Was the virus ever actually present in the market, and could its presence have accelerated the rapid viral outbreak? Absolutely, Dr. Boyle and others argue.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean the virus actually began there.\n\nSo, where did this dangerous strain of coronavirus begin? Dr Boyle contends that the virus was manufactured and bio-engineered in a Biosafety Level 4 laboratory \u2013 a laboratory that just so happens to be located directly in Wuhan.\n\nThis laboratory is specially designated by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the only lab in China that can contain and work with the world\u2019s deadliest viruses. Dr. Boyle asserts this is proof that the WHO knows far more about the outbreak than they are letting on.\n\nThe allegation is consistent with a January 2020 paper published by The Lancet, which found that more than a third of the patients tested in their sample had NO contact with the Wuhan wet market, including \u201cPatient Zero.\u201d\n\nIn other words, growing evidence suggests that 2019-nCoV leaked out of the Wuhan laboratory and into the surrounding community, where it would go on to infect thousands of unsuspecting people \u2013 a number that\u2019s steadily rising.\n\nNow scrambling to contain the epidemic, the Chinese government initially tried to cover it up. They even threatened and attempted to silence a Chinese doctor named Li Wenliang who first warned of the coming outbreak.\n\nSadly, breaking reports tell us that Wenliang succumbed to the virus on February 7.\n\nNew coronavirus has links to manufactured SARS virus, HIV virus\n\nWhy manufacture and design a lethal and unprecedented virus? Simple, Dr. Boyle asserts: to create biological weapons for warfare.\n\nIn the interview (which hopefully won\u2019t be removed from YouTube), he hypothesizes that WHO-affiliated Wuhan scientists genetically tinkered with the coronavirus responsible for SARS (SARS-CoV) until it became the monstrosity it is now (2019-nCoV). The current coronavirus reportedly has a 15 percent greater fatality rate and 83 percent greater infection rate than SARS did, which ransacked the world in 2002 to 2004.\n\nDr. Boyle also cites evidence indicating that Chinese officials smuggled coronavirus materials out of a Canadian lab that\u2019s known for leading research, development, and testing of biological warfare weapons.\n\nAdditionally, a team of Indian virologists just revealed in a January 2020 paper that the 2019-nCoV shares an \u201cuncanny similarity\u201d of genetic inserts with the virus that causes AIDS. (Their paper has been withdrawn\u2026another thinly-veiled cover up attempt?)\n\nTellingly, Chinese doctors have reportedly been using the HIV drug lopinavir/ritonavir as an off-label treatment for people with 2019-nCoV\u2026so clearly there\u2019s no denying at least some link between these two viruses.\n\nMeanwhile, other scientists seem to be wasting no time to continue tinkering with viruses and trying to capitalize on the outbreak.\n\nIn an article published by CNN on February 7, Robin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London, states rather bluntly: \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that as a global community we maximize our effort to get a vaccine available in the shortest possible time.\u201d Big Pharma experts are hopeful that a vaccine will be available as soon as 2021 \u2013 \u201cfaster than it\u2019s been done before,\u201d brags Shattock.\n\nStay tuned for regular updates about the coronavirus and more tips on keeping your family healthy.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nGreatgameindia.com\n\nCDC.gov\n\nWSJ.com\n\nBusinessinsider.com\n\nReuters.com\n\nLivescience.com\n\nTheLancet.com\n\nLaw.illinois.edu\n\nBiorxiv.org",

        "by Paromita Datta published on - October 05, 2020\n\nCOVID-19 shows a wide range of manifestations among those affected. While some show severe symptoms, many remain asymptomatic. A study carried out by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute shed clarity on why these cases are so variable. It revealed how a subset of patients with an affected immune system shows a severe form of the disease.\n\nPublished under two papers in the journal Science, the study narrowed down two sets of patients with a specific make-up in their immunity system. The first set was of patients with a key mutation in their immunity genes. The second set of patients had auto-antibodies that attack the same areas in the immune system instead of fighting the disease. [1] [2]\n\nThese observations were based on cross-country collaboration of clinicians across the world. The study enrolled people with a severe form of the disease with a plan to study their genetic profile. The number of participants was more than 3000 candidates, enrolled in the period between February and March. As the team analyzed the genetic samples, they observed harmful mutations present in certain patients, both young and old.\n\nOf every 659 patients, 23 carried genetic mutations that are involved in generating the antiviral interferons. This amounts to 3.5 percent of the patients with COVID-19 who showed these mutations. Another 10 percent of the patients showed the creation of auto-antibodies that targeted the immune system.\n\nFor the latest updates on COVID-19, please visit the CDC & NIH. [3] [4]",
        "by Raksha Hegde published on - September 28, 2020\n\nAn online psychological test of university students in Italy during the COVID-19 outbreak revealed that all of them were in the clinical range for stress and anxiety. This assessment was completed during a pre-intervention stage of a study on the effects on mind-body intervention for students in week four of quarantine in Italy. Furthermore, the study conducted by the University of Salerno, Italy, published in the Frontiers of Psychology journal, found that the negative affect, which implies feelings of emotional distress, during the pandemic were substantially above average. [1]\n\nIn the assessment, 311 undergraduate and graduate students (mean age of 31.3 years) scored high on selected measures for stress, anxiety, and global distress. The majority of the students in the sample size for this research were female. This is also consistent with the recent studies conducted on undergraduate college students in China and in the US that have found that students are suffering higher levels of anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak. The COVID-19-related stressors in these studies generally include economic stressors, effects on daily-life, and academic delays for university students. The findings of these studies indicate that public health measures are vital to monitor the mental health of students during the pandemic and in its aftermath.

(Source.)\n\nWe know that as huge as these numbers are which are official government statistics, that they only represent a very small fraction of the total number of deaths and injuries suffered by those who chose to receive COVID-19 vaccines during the past 18 months.\n\nLast year, Dr. Jessica Rose did a comprehensive analysis to determine the \u201cunder-reported factor\u201d in VAERS, and came up with 41X, meaning that the recorded data for adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines in VAERS had to be multiplied by 41 to get more accurate numbers. See:\n\nHowever, now that more time has elapsed since this study was performed, many feel that 41X is significantly too low, and should be closer to 100X, which is the number that was previously used based on a 2011 report by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Inc. for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nAlthough 25% of ambulatory patients experience an adverse drug event, less than 0.3% of all adverse drug events and 1-13% of serious events are reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Likewise, fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported. Low reporting rates preclude or slow the identification of \u201cproblem\u201d drugs and vaccines that endanger public health. New surveillance methods for drug and vaccine adverse effects are needed. (Source.)\n\nSo if we take the publicly available data from VAERS and the European EMA and multiply by 100, these would be the true numbers of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccines: 7,532,200 deaths and 593,831,800 injuries in Europe and the U.S.\n\n46,160 deaths and 4,623,724 injuries in EudraVigilance\n\nThe European (EEA and non-EEA countries) database of suspected drug reaction reports is EudraVigilance, verified by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and they are now reporting 46,160 fatalities, and 4,623,724 injuries following injections of five experimental COVID-19 shots:\n\nFrom the total of injuries recorded, almost half of them (2,106,816) are serious injuries.\n\n\u201cSeriousness provides information on the suspected undesirable effect; it can be classified as \u2018serious\u2019 if it corresponds to a medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalisation, results in another medically important condition, or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.\u201d\n\nA Health Impact News subscriber in Europe ran the reports for each of the four COVID-19 shots we are including here. It is a lot of work to tabulate each reaction with injuries and fatalities, since there is no place on the EudraVigilance system we have found that tabulates all the results.\n\nSince we have started

The fatalities are grouped by symptoms, and some fatalities may have resulted from multiple symptoms.\n\nParents Offer Up Their Babies and Toddlers to the Demonic Vaccine Cult \u2013 Hallucinations Among Reported Side Effects\n\nLast month (June, 2022) the FDA gave parents authorization to start offering their babies and toddlers to the COVID-19 Vaccine Cult, and injections began in children under the age of 5.\n\nThere are currently 476 cases of COVID-19 injuries in this age group in VAERS (source), although many of these cases were before the authorization was given.\n\nI have listed all current 476 cases on one page that can be viewed here. The most current cases, after the authorization, can be seen at the bottom.\n\nRemarkably, many of the cases listed prior to the authorization, were entries made by health officials because after injecting the child, they found out that the child was under the age of 5, and not yet authorized to receive the shots.\n\nIn other words, the parents were so desperate to inject their toddlers, that they lied about their child\u2019s age to get the shot, which would have been a dose made for older children, and the health official felt compelled to enter it into VAERS to cover themselves legally after they found out.\n\nStaff was misled by mother, regarding the patient\u201ds age. This resulted in the child being vaccinated despite bing ineligible (due to being 4). The vaccination process otherwise went without incident. Patient was observation for approx. 15 minutes after, in accordance with current guidelines. Afterwards, the patient left with her mother again without incident. (VAERS ID 2264666) The patient received a pediatric Pfizer Covid vaccine, but she is only 4 years old, which is under the approved age. The parents falsified the child\u201ds date of birth during check in and on the paperwork. They called the pharmacy the next day (4/21/22) to apologize and let us know that she was actually under age. There were no adverse effects reported during the time of the vaccine, at the time of the phone call on 4/21/22 or at the time of the follow up call on 4/25/22. (VAERS ID 2250179) Patient falsified DOB when registering for vaccination, stating the minor was born 10 days earlier than actual DOB. Guardian consented to the vaccination. Department of Health verified with statistical records the patients actual DOB, which made the vaccine a contraindication. No known adverse reactions noted. (VAERS ID 2283077)\n\nIn at least one case, a doctor approved the shot even though it was not yet authorized by the FDA:\n\nNo symptoms or adverse events noted. Patient is traveling in June of 2022 with her family. Her parents requested to get her first dose of the vaccine early since she is traveling. Ok\u201dd per Dr. to give a couple of months early. (VAERS ID 2281214)\n\nCases where the new vaccines were given to the babies and toddlers under the age of 5 after the FDA authorization and there was an adverse reaction are just now starting to trickle in.\n\nIn one case, a 2-year-old baby girl started hallucinating within 6 hours of being injected:\n\nPatient developed sudden onset hallucinations (visual, possibly auditory) and psychosis beginning 6 hours after vaccination and lasting for 7 hours, then fell asleep. Reawakened with more hallucinations/psychosis 16 hours after vaccination (6 am today) lasting for another 1.5 hours. Transported to Pediatric ED where psychosis/hallucinations resolved. Examination normal. Remained at baseline (normal) upon discharge from ED. (VAERS ID 2329230)\n\nOne mother reported on Twitter that her 8-year-old daughter started hallucinating and having feelings of suicide after the shots.\n\nI never heard my 8 year old talk about suicide or have hallucinations or feeling of bugs crawling on her until we have the #safeandEffective vaccine. (Source.)\n\nEarly reports in VAERS show that the poor toddlers are putting up a good fight in trying to reject the shots, but sadly, they are over-matched and sometimes just end up getting jabbed twice for resisting.\n\nPatient moved during vaccination attempt and over half of COVID 19 vaccine was not injected intramuscularly. Patient returned on 6/23/22 to another mobile vaccine clinic to receive full dose appropriate for her age. (3 years old \u2013 VAERS ID 2329682) Vaccinator inserted needle into pt\u201ds arm. Mother did not have a good hold and pt moved. Needle came out before vaccinator was able to inject. Pt was then vaccinated with full dose. (3 years old \u2013 VAERS ID 2327250) Nurse stuck needle in child\u201ds arm to vaccinate, but child pulled arm away before vaccine was administered. Nurse wasted that dose and administered the vaccine in the opposite arm. (2 years old \u2013 VAERS ID 2326989) EUA \u2013 young moderna dose 1. Patient moved away during administration and only received a partial dose (majority of solution was not injected). Parent informed and clinical team. Patient was re-vaccinated per guidelines. (2 years old \u2013 VAERS ID 2328918) Needle inserted into patients L thigh, but vaccine was not administered. Patient slapped the syringe and the needle bent. RN was able to remove entire needle. Small scratch noted on L thigh. (2 years old \u2013 VAERS ID 2325671)\n\nSteve Kirsch reported that nurses told him that many of these children 2 and 3 years old are having seizures.\n\nI\u2019m getting multiple reports from my nurse friends about kids 2 and 3 years old having seizures. It is ONLY happening on vaccinated kids, and symptoms start 2 to 5 days after the COVID vaccine. Doctors are mystified by a rash of seizures, rashes, etc. happening to 2 and 3-year-old kids. The only thing these kids have in common is that they were given the COVID vaccine just days earlier (two to five days earlier). The doctors cannot figure out what is causing the seizures (since it couldn\u2019t be the vaccine since those are safe and effective). The medical staff is not permitted to talk about the cases to the press or on social media or they will be fired. One nurse posted something to the effect of \u201chow is this legal????\u201d I had to paraphrase to protect the poster. This is why you are hearing these reports from me. They can\u2019t fire me. There is nothing on the mainstream media about this since the nurses and doctors aren\u2019t allowed to talk about it. This will all come out some day, but for now, everyone is keeping quiet about it and the doctors are instructed to convince the parents that it isn\u2019t vaccine related and that they are the only ones having the problem. Because that\u2019s how science works.

        "by The Expos\u00e9\n\nThe UK Medicine Regulator has confirmed that over a period of nineteen months the Covid-19 Vaccines have caused at least 5.5x as many deaths as all other available vaccines combined in the past 21 years.\n\nThis means, that when compared side by side, the Covid-19 injections are a shocking 7,402% more deadly than every other vaccine available in the UK.\n\nA Freedom of Information request was made via email to the Medicine and Healthcare product Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on the 6th August 2021 in which a Mr Anderson asked the MHRA the following questions \u2013\n\nHow many Deaths have there been from all Covid-19 vaccines?\n\nAre there any other reporting AI system monitoring systems like the Yellow Card scheme?\n\nAre Covid-19 Vaccines still in trials?\n\nHow many deaths has there been in last 20 years by previous Vaccines without Covid-19 Vaccines?\n\nWhat happens if a there is a new vaccine or new drug? What process and monitoring do they go through?\n\nWhat cut off point will the MHRA say a vaccine or drug is unsafe for humans?\n\nThe MHRA responded with the usual \u201cwe do not hold this information\u201d, as seen time and time again from Government departments.\n\nHowever, they did confirm that they are using other epidemiological studies, anonymised GP-based electronic healthcare records and international experience to proactively monitor safety alongside the spontaneous reports received via the Yellow Card scheme.\n\nThe MHRA also confirmed that the current Covid-19 vaccines on offer in the United Kingdom are only under a temporary authorisation and that these authorisations do not constitute a marketing authorisation.\n\nIn answer to the question asked on the number of deaths due to all other vaccines in the past twenty years the MHRA provided the usual robotic response about how great the Covid-19 vaccines are and how they are the \u201csingle most effective treatment for preventing serious illness due to Covid-19\u201d but what they did not do is say that they \u201cdo not hold this information\u201d.\n\nInstead, they revealed that they had received a total of 404 reported adverse reactions to all available vaccines (excluding the Covid-19 injections) associated with a fatal outcome between the 1st January 2001 and the 25th August 2021 \u2013 a time frame of 20 years and 8 months.\n\nBut how does that fare against the number of reported adverse reactions to all temporarily authorised Covid-19 vaccines associated with a fatal outcome?\n\nWell, since the Pfizer injection was rolled out in December 2020 there have been 808 reported deaths as of 13th July 22, meaning that in just 19 months, this \u201cvaccine\u201d alone outnumbers the deaths due to all other vaccines combined in the past 20 years.\n\nHowever, the AstraZeneca viral vector injection has fared much worse with 1,294 deaths being reported to the MHRA since January 2020, more than three times as many deaths as what has been reported due to all other vaccines in the past 20 years.\n\nThere have also been 62 reported deaths due to the Moderna jab since it was first administered in June 2021, and 49 deaths where the brand of Covid-19 vaccine was not specified in the report.\n\nTherefore, up to July 13th 2022, there have been a grand total of 2,213 deaths reported to the MHRA as adverse reactions to all available Covid-19 vaccines in the United Kingdom since the beginning of 2021.\n\nMeaning there have officially been 5.5x as many deaths in just 19 months due to the Covid-19 vaccines than there have been due to every other available vaccine combined since the year 2001.\n\nTwenty years and 8 months is a period that is 13.7 x longer than the nineteen-month period where the Covid-19 vaccines have been rolled out.\n\nTherefore, the number of deaths reported to all other vaccines combined in the same time frame of nineteen months equates to 29.5 deaths.\n\nThis means the Covid-19 injections are proving to be a shocking 7,402% more deadly than every other vaccine available in the UK."

        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nThe vaccine industry is committing suicide.\n\nIt was announced this week that the CDC has ordered 1.6 million doses of Bavarian Nordic\u2019s smallpox and monkeypox vaccines to be injected into people during the second half of 2022, starting with 56,000 doses immediately, another 240,000 doses in the coming weeks, then another 750,000 doses over the rest of the summer with another 500,000 doses in the fall.\n\nWith the carnage that has just occurred for the past 18 months where 7,478,300 people were killed and 583,023,500 people were injured by experimental COVID shots in the U.S. and Europe, who in the world would fall for the lies of Big Pharma and their crony politicians again, and sign up to get these shots?\n\nCertainly not the anti-vaxxers, and certainly not those who were foolish enough to get the COVID shots, were injured by them, and then woke up to the fact that they were lied to and hence suffered tremendously.\n\nNo, these shots are obviously targeting those who survived the COVID shots, believed the shots somehow conferred benefit on them since they are still alive and breathing, and trust the medical tyrants to cure their fear of the fake monkeypox pandemic which has not even really started yet.\n\nMost of them are probably suffering some kind of skin infection that was probably produced as a side effect from the COVID shots, such as shingles, and they will be led to believe they have some dreaded new form of monkeypox that needs another vaccine.\n\nThis is vaccine marketing suicide, as they are killing off and crippling the vaccine cult members, and destroying their repeat business. Obviously reducing the world\u2019s population is a worthy goal in their minds, so much so they are sacrificing the future of the vaccine business model by destroying their future customers.\n\nAmid monkeypox outbreak, US officials plan to release 1.6M doses of Bavarian Nordic\u2019s Jynneos vaccine\n\nby Eric Sagonowsky\n\nFiercePharma\n\nAs a monkeypox outbreak quietly gains steam in the U.S. and elsewhere, American health officials are laying out a plan to stop it. One major component is vaccinations. Tuesday, officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed a plan to make available 1.6 million doses of Bavarian Nordic\u2019s smallpox and monkeypox vaccine Jynneos by the end of the year, according to press reports. Of that total, officials will immediately make available 56,000 doses in areas of high transmission. They\u2019ll follow that release with another 240,000 doses in the coming weeks, then with another 750,000 doses over the rest of the summer, USA Today reports. The officials plan to release another 500,000 doses in the fall, taking the total supply to around 1.6 million doses. The doses are intended for people with known exposures to the virus or those who are at high risk. At a briefing, CDC official Jennifer McQuiston said that intimate or sexual contact appears to be a \u201cprimary driver for transmission,\u201d as quoted by USA Today. Officials say people should get vaccinated if they have had a sexual partner diagnosed with the illness. Men who have sex with men\u2014and who have had multiple partners in areas of high transmission\u2014should seek vaccination as well, officials said. Bavarian Nordic\u2019s Jynneos vaccine has been in high demand for more than a month since monkeypox cases started cropping up in Europe and North America. In the U.S., the vaccine won approval in 2019 to prevent smallpox and monkeypox in people determined to be at high risk. Outside of the U.S., Bavarian Nordic in mid-May inked a vaccine order with an unnamed European country. After that order, the company has twice lifted its 2022 revenue forecast after more orders came in. Also on Tuesday, CDC officials said they\u2019re starting up a Emergency Operations Center to respond to the monkeypox outbreak. The center will be staffed by 300 people.\n\nRead the full article at FiercePharma.\n\nRelated:\n\nSee Also:",
        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nRates of cancer have exploded following the COVID-19 mass vaccination programs, with doctors and scientists all over the world now sounding the alarm.\n\nJust today a reader contacted us with the following tragic story:\n\nSubject: Cancer after Pfizer vaccine Hello, My husband prior to the vaccine was fit and healthy, strong, active. We both had the vaccination on 12.11.2021. about 10 hours kater we spitted first swollen node in his left armpit. Doctors ignored the symptom. Then second node, third\u2026 With 6 swollen nodes he was diagnosed with Mantle cell lymphoma. He\u2019s during very aggressive chemotherapy called Nordic regime. He\u2019s only 36 in May, so he was 35 when it all has started. MCL affects people after 60 usually. Before the vaccination our children brought from school many different viruses, from common flu, tummy bug, chicken pox, ear infections to covid. My husband was totally fine that time. His immune system worked brilliantly during September and October when me and our daughters suffered from mentioned diseases. He was working and taking care of us at that time. If he would have MCL then he wouldn\u2019t be able to fight all these viruses. Everything has changed within the hours from the first dose of Pfizer. At first my husband was ignored by GP as he claimed it was typical side effect which should disappear. When more nodes started swilling gp still claimed we should wait yet in January my husband was advised not to have second dose of the vaccination due to the side effects. In March I requested blood test to check whether it was cancer. Results returned completely fine. I immediately booked next blood test. Also returned completely fine. So without hesitation I booked appointment with go but this time I asked for different gp. During this appointment my husband was referred for ultrasound scan. From there to cancer clinic. 3 days later biopsy took place. Couple if days later we learnt the diagnosis mantle cell lymphoma. At this stage we were told it has nothing to do with the vaccination, yet for months we were expected to wait for side effects to disappear. Also, if the cancer is not in connection to vaccinate then how come my husband survived the 8 waves if different diseases starting from September ? In August we spent holidays in Scotland. Lots of walking and driving. My husband was in a very good shape. Let me say it again, prior to the vaccination my husband was strong, fit, active and healthy. Our life as a family has been literally ruined. We cannot go anywhere, we can\u2019t work, my husband us to weak, I have to care for him now and children. We are facing financial difficulties heading to a place where we won\u2019t be able to cover winter bills. MCL is incurable. Only treatable. If we are lucky, we may be back to temporary normality by March/April 2023. MCL comes back. Noone knows when. Second time it hits stronger\u2026 We can\u2019t take girls for holidays, we can\u2019t mix with other people as my husband\u2019s immune system is compromised. I am on standby all the time as I may need to take him to hospital in emergency like it happened already. Most of days we travel to hospital anyway. Sometimes even twice a day. I have never returned to myself after COVID and vaccination. Before I was very active and fit. Now Im not even at 50% of what I used to be. Our children will never be vaccinated!\n\nI did a search in the U.S. government Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) to see how many cases of the most common cancers had been reported following COVID-19 vaccines, and it returned a result of 837 cases of cancer, including 88 deaths, 66 permanent disabilities, and 104 life threatening events. (Source.)\n\nAnd this not an exhaustive list, as I tried to include ALL cancers listed in VAERS, but the database could not handle the query.\n\nI listed the cases by age, and of the 837 cases, 375 of them had no recorded age, although often the age can be found in the description.\n\nSo I put those 375 cases on the first page of the results, and starting on the second page you can see how young some of these cancer patients are following COVID-19 vaccines. (Source.)\n\nIt begins with a 12-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy, followed by many young adults in their 20s.\n\nUsing the exact same search terms for cancer, I then searched ALL FDA-approved vaccines for the previous 30 years and found only 140 cases of cancer reported. (Source.)\n\nThat result is for 360 months (30 years), whereas the 837 cases following the experimental COVID-19 vaccines were reported in just 20 months, since the roll out of the COVID-19 shots beginning in December of 2020.\n\nThat is an increase of 10,661.4%!\n\nA pathologist who lives in Sweden was just interviewed recently about the increasing rates of cancer she is seeing in her patients following the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nHer name is Dr. Ute Krueger, and the video is found on the Doctors For Covid Ethics Rumble Channel.\n\nThis is an amazing interview! Dr. Krueger is highly credentialed in her field, and yet few of her colleagues are willing to follow where the evidence leads, even though everyone is seeing a huge surge in cancer cases, and her reports to the Swedish Drug Administration have not been addressed. She states:\n\nI studied medicine because I wanted to help people. But now it feels like I am watching people being killed, and there\u2019s little I can do.\n\nThe Expos\u00e9 has also just published an excellent review of some of the scientific literature showing how the spike proteins are interfering with \u201cthe DNA repair mechanism in lymphocytes.\u201d\n\nThe COVID-19 mRNA \u201cVaccines\u201d cause Cancer; here\u2019s the evidence\u2026\n\nby Joel Smalley; Professional Data Analyst\n\nThe Expos\u00e9\n\nThe homologous recombination DNA repair pathway is one of the mechanisms that the body uses to stop your cells turning cancerous in response to environmental stress.\n\nOne of the most important components of this pathway is Tumor protein P53 (p53), the \u201cguardian of the genome\u201d. It protects our cells from cellular damage. Under cellular stress, p53 jumps into action, regulating gene expression to control DNA repair, cell division and cell death. It is the most commonly mutated gene in cancer.\n\nIn October 2021, two revered scientists, called Jiang and Mei, had a paper published, after peer review, in MDPI, showing that the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein obliterated the DNA repair mechanism in lymphocytes.\n\nEffect of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on homologous repair (HR) efficiency in lymphocytes\n\nThe viral spike protein was so toxic to this pathway that it knocked 90% of it out. If the whole spike protein got into the nucleus (in the ovaries), and enough of it was produced and hung around long enough before the body was able to get rid of it all, it would cause cancer. Fortunately, in the case of naturally infection, this is unlikely to occur.\n\nUnfortunately, the experimental mRNA toxshot induces spike protein to be produced (the full length spike exactly matching \u2013 amino acid for amino acid \u2013 the full length of the viral spike protein\u00b9) in and around the cell nucleus\u00b2 and is produced for at least 60 days and almost certainly longer\u00b3.\n\n\u201cFact checkers\u201d said the viral spike protein doesn\u2019t get in the nucleus despite the expert scientists showing that it absolutely does.\n\nConfocal microscopy study showing the spiker protein (green) proliferating the cell nucleus (blue)\n\nPublic health authorities and regulators said the vaccinal spike protein doesn\u2019t get in the nucleus despite the mRNA manufacturers submitting pictures of it doing so to them as part of their emergency use application.\n\nOK, so it gets into the nucleus but the official narrative says it doesn\u2019t stay in the body for more than a few hours. But, a huge study by one of the most respected molecular biology groups in the world at Stanford university\u2074 showed that the mRNA (producing the vaccinal spike antigen) was still present and active in the body after 60 days.\n\nJiang and Mei, quite logically and reasonably, cautioned that the mRNA spike protein would likely have the same effect as the viral spike protein on p53 and therefore cause cancer.\n\nTwo months after this revelation was highlighted by my friend, Jikky the Mouse, the Jiang and Mei paper was retracted due to spurious \u201cexpressions of concern\u201d (EOC) about the methods of the study despite them being standard practice.\n\nMoreover, the authors of the EOC were Eric Freed, the head of the US National Institute of Health (NIH) that funded Moderna, the patent holder of the COVID mRNA toxshot\u2075 and Oliver Shildgen, the actual editor of the journal that originally accepted the paper! And neither of them declared the conflicts of interest.\n\nWell, despite the retraction, the spike protein circulating in large quantities, in the direct vicinity of the cell nucleus, for elongated periods of time, still has the potential to induce cancer in those cells (ovary, pancreas, breast, prostate, lymph nodes). These cancers can take years to develop and so it\u2019s possible that we don\u2019t see much of a safety signal for 5 or 10 years.\n\nSources/References\n\nhttps://sciencebasedmedicine.org/spike-proteins-covid-19-and-vaccines/\n\nhttps://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/foi-2183-09.pdf\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35148837/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8786601/\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/moderna-covid-vaccine-patent-dispute-national-institutes-health/\n\nRead the full article at The Expos\u00e9.\n\nSee Also:\n\nCOVID-19 \u201cVaccine\u201d Casualties List\n\nSee Also:",
        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nAccording to statistics published by the CDC, 222,123,223 people in the U.S. are now fully vaccinated with COVID-19 shots, about two thirds of the population. (Source.)\n\n78% of the population has had at least one COVID-19 shot, which means a significant number of people stopped getting the shots after receiving one, and that percentage continues to drop with the boosters.\n\n593,739,529 COVID-19 shots have been administered during the past 18 months, producing 1,307,928 reports of deaths and injuries filed in the national Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). (Source.)\n\nThat means for every 454 COVID-19 experimental shots injected into people, an adverse event was recorded in VAERS (it is probably much higher than that, but these are the ones the CDC decided to release to the public in the VAERS database).\n\nBy way of contrast, data collected by the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program between the years 2006 and 2014 report that 2,532,428,541 doses of all FDA-approved vaccines were injected into people during that 9-year period (source), which produced 272,905 cases of injuries and deaths reported to VAERS. (Source.)\n\nThat means for every 9,280 vaccines administered during the years from 2006 through 2014, an adverse event was recorded in VAERS.\n\nThat is a tragic number for vaccine victims in an industry that cannot be sued for damages from their vaccine products, but it pales in comparison to how deadly the COVID-19 vaccines have been.\n\nThere has been a 2000% increase in adverse events recorded in VAERS following the COVID-19 shots.\n\nJust looking at reported deaths in VAERS, a death was reported for every 20,452 COVID-19 vaccine administered, whereas between 2006 and 2014 a death was reported for every 1,146,414 FDA approved vaccine administered.\n\nThat is 56 times more deaths following COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nAnd they keep on injecting people with them, including now infants as young as 6 months old.\n\nThese are government stats people. This is what they admit to. How much worse are the actual deaths and injuries following COVID-19 shots, and what does that mean for our country?\n\nWe are just beginning to find out as life and health insurance benefit payouts skyrocketed in 2021 when the vaccines rolled out, and birth rates declined.\n\nWe are now a year and half into the Population Reduction program the Globalists are implementing, and unless there is a massive uprising and resistance movement, it is all down hill from here, as they begin Phase II with the MonkeyPox fear campaign and millions of doses of untested vaccines ready to go.\n\nAs I have publicly stated in the past, I am PROUD to wear the \u201canti-vaccine\u201d label, because the actual science has NEVER proven vaccines to be either safe, or effective.\n\nSee Also:\n\nCOVID-19 \u201cVaccine\u201d Casualties List\n\nSee Also:",

(Source.)\n\nA 2011 report by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Inc. for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) stated that less than 1% of all adverse events following vaccines are ever reported to VAERS.\n\nAlthough 25% of ambulatory patients experience an adverse drug event, less than 0.3% of all adverse drug events and 1-13% of serious events are reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Likewise, fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported. Low reporting rates preclude or slow the identification of \u201cproblem\u201d drugs and vaccines that endanger public health. New surveillance methods for drug and vaccine adverse effects are needed. (Source.)\n\nThere have now been more deaths and vaccine side effects reported during the past 20 months to VAERS following COVID-19 vaccines than there has been for the entire previous 30 years for all FDA-approved vaccines before the Emergency Use Authorization of the COVID-19 shots in December of 2020.

women. (Source.)\n\nThis has to be the saddest, most criminal activity of Big Pharma and the FDA by allowing these COVID-19 shots to be injected into pregnant and young women.\n\nPfizer had data showing how dangerous these shots were for pregnant women, but the FDA gave authorization anyway.\n\nDr. Byram W. Bridle addressed this human tragedy on his blog earlier this week:\n\nI Am In Shock. The United States Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA) had requested 75 years to release the documents that they reviewed from Pfizer prior to issuing emergency use authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b mRNA \u2018vaccine\u2019 (Comirnaty) against SARS-CoV-2, which can cause COVID-19. However, a judge over-ruled this and issued a court order that the documents be released in large monthly installments. Today, an absolutely shocking set of data were brought to my attention. They are not new. They are from a document that was in the data dump released back in May of this year. However, I want to help my fellow scientists in making sure that this science gets widely distributed throughout the world. This is for the sake of \u2018fully informed consent\u2019, something that regulatory agencies, public health officials and too many physicians seem to have abandoned over the past couple of years. For a long time I have been arguing that our children need to be left out of the massive conflicts over the science underpinning COVID-19. In my opinion, adults can conduct their own risk-benefit analyses regarding whether they want to receive one of the current COVID-19 inoculations. However, far too many adults are making these decisions based on pseudo-science, data from flawed studies, misinformation, and outright disinformation being propagated by physicians and public health officials, many of whom are unqualified to opine on anything in the field of vaccinology. I have never felt comfortable about these injections being used in \u2018children, adolescents and young-adults of child-bearing age\u2019. This was the precise terminology I used in a parent\u2019s guide to COVID-19 vaccines that I wrote more than one year ago. The highest quality data for assessing a novel medical product are derived from clinical studies. This is because these types of experiments in people are typically well-controlled and include what is known as \u2018active monitoring\u2019; there is follow-up to assess safety and efficacy. This is why the clinical testing phases should never be compromised. With this in mind, let\u2019s explore a stunning set of data that Pfizer provided to the US-FDA. The data in this document were accumulated up until February 28, 2021. Notably, on page 9, safety concerns based on the US Pharmacovigilance Plan included \u201cmissing information\u201d on \u201cUse in Pregnancy and lactation\u201d. The data that had accumulated up to the end of February, 2021 were from too small of a sample size (i.e., # of pregnant or lactating women) to justify its use in these populations. However, here are the data that were available at that time regarding outcomes in pregnant women that had received Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 inoculation; this is quoted from the top of table 6 (I have italicized and/or bolded the most important points)\u2026 Pregnancy cases: 274 cases including: \u2022 270 mother cases and 4 foetus/baby cases representing 270 unique pregnancies (the 4 foetus/baby cases were linked to 3 mother cases; 1 mother case involved twins). \u2022 Pregnancy outcomes for the 270 pregnancies were reported as spontaneous abortion (23), outcome pending (5), premature birth with neonatal death, spontaneous abortion with intrauterine death (2 each), spontaneous abortion with neonatal death, and normal outcome (1 each). No outcome was provided for 238 pregnancies (note that 2 different outcomes were reported for each twin, and both were counted). Apparently, outcomes will never be known for 88% (238/270) of the pregnancies. Why was the follow-up rate on these cases so abysmal? NutriTruth has a great graph on their website that summarizes the results from cases for which follow-up data were available\u2026 It appears that data would be available for five of the pregnancies, but these outcomes were still unknown at the time that Pfizer\u2019s document was written. As such, there are solid data available from 29 pregnancies. One out of 29 of these pregnancies resulted in a \u2018normal\u2019 outcome. This means that 28 out of the 29 babies died! That is a 97% death rate. I don\u2019t care which trustworthy data set you look at to determine a \u2018background\u2019 death rate, none of them come close to 97%. Spontaneous abortions are more common than many people appreciate, but, again, they are nowhere near the rate in this study. Even in the case of the \u2018normal outcome\u2019, this means there was an apparently healthy baby. However, one cannot be certain that the outcome was \u2018normal\u2019, until the baby has had all of their physiological systems fully mature, which means early adulthood. I have looked at Pfizer\u2019s pre-clinical reproductive toxicity data and they are fatally flawed. Issues included \u2018vaccinating\u2019 the females only; apparently it was forgotten that \u2018it takes two to tango\u2019. Also, the rodent models that were used express the low-affinity version of the receptor for the spike protein encoded by the \u2018vaccines\u2019. People express the high-affinity receptor. This means the rodent models aren\u2019t capable of revealing toxicities that might be associated with the spike protein. In short, the pre-clinical studies could provide no assurance whatsoever that Pfizer\u2019s vaccine would be safe in the context of pregnancy. Now there is proof that data were in the hands of regulatory agencies that suggested the potential for a 97% fatality rate for babies from \u2018vaccinated\u2019 women. I have collaborated with scientists and physicians about the post-rollout \u2018real-world\u2019 studies on pregnancy and the COVID-19 shots. They are highly flawed. I co-authored a paper about this, but have yet to find an editor that will even allow it to undergo peer review (I have had no problems with this for any of my cancer- or basic virology-focused papers). Regardless, many other reputable scientists and physicians have been addressing this. Further, these \u2018real-world\u2019 studies should never have been authorized based on the data presented here. Many countries have pushed Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 \u2018vaccine\u2019 on pregnant women, often via mandates. This was been done with the full blessing of their societies for obstetrics and gynecology. Are obstetricians and gynecologists going to continue to make these recommendations with these data in-hand? At the end of the day, couples experiencing pregnancies or who wish to do so must make it their own responsibility to educate themselves to facilitate fully informed consent. Too many obstetricians and gynecologists are either too superficially trained in the immunological sub-discipline of vaccinology or are too afraid of contradicting a narrative for which dissent is punished. Some physicians are starting to speak up about this. Unfortunately, their singular personal observations are simply deemed anecdotal. However, as a scientist, I have been trained to observe the cumulative nature of these reports; to not dismiss them out-of-hand, and to use them to formulate legitimate scientific questions. If you or your baby have experienced any issues post-inoculation, please report these to your physician. They are obligated to submit an adverse event report, without opining on whether or not they think it might or might not be related. The accumulation of these reports is the only way scientists can help identify safety signals during a public rollout of a novel medical product. A 97% death rate among babies from pregnant mothers that were \u2018vaccinated\u2019 is appalling. And this was from Pfizer\u2019s own clinical trial data. This suggests a massive breakdown in the health regulatory process. The public, whom health regulatory agencies are to be serving, should demand accountability from these government-run institutions. If I were a regulatory scientist assessing the pregnancy outcome data from Pfizer, there is no way that I would ever have supported the use of their inoculation in pregnant women. And I would never have allowed \u2018real-world\u2019 data from flawed studies to replace proper pre-clinical and clinical trials. Nor would I remain silent about this knowledge. Regulators who know better need to start speaking up.\n\nRead the full article at COVID Chronicles.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Mumper was recently interviewed where she stated:\n\n\u201cFor a first-trimester woman to get this injection, they have more of a chance of having a miscarriage or stillbirth than if they were to actually take an abortifacient.\u201d\n\n2 Young Mothers Talk About Losing Their Unborn Babies Just After a COVID-19 Vaccine:\n\nReports of Brain Damage, Seizures, Bowel Disease Continue for Babies 6 Months Old to 4 Years Old\n\nAnother 103 records of COVID-19 vaccine injuries were added to VAERS yesterday (July 22, 2022) for the 6-month to 4-years-old age group, continuing to show horrible side effects that include brain injuries, anaphylactic shock, dementia, depression, lupus, pancreatitis, colitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, eye infections, encephalitis, seizures, meningitis, and all sorts of rashes, since these shots were approved for this age group a few weeks ago, in June.\n\nI put the latest 103 records on the second page here. I read through every one of them, and I have to admit that emotionally, it is not an easy thing to do.\n\nSome \u201chighlights\u201d from the write-ups of these infants who were injected.\n\nA 6-month-old baby boy from VAERS ID 2370120:\n\nwithin 24hs of getting the Moderna covdi19 vaccine patient stopped breathing; within 24hs of getting the Moderna covdi19 vaccine patient went unconscious; This spontaneous case was reported by a patient family member or friend and describes the occurrence of RESPIRATORY ARREST \u2013 On 30-Jun-2022, the patient experienced RESPIRATORY ARREST (within 24hs of getting the Moderna covdi19 vaccine patient stopped breathing) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, medically significant and life threatening) and LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (within 24hs of getting the Moderna covdi19 vaccine patient went unconscious) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant).\n\nA 4-year-old boy from VAERS ID 2369485:\n\nThursday, July 7th, I picked him up from school and walked him home. He only ate part of his fig bar because he said it didn\u201dt taste good. He also didn\u201dt want any dinner which is very rare. He said that his tummy hurt. I assumed it was the fig bar. He finally ate 2 bites of soup but didn\u201dt want any more. When I brushed his teeth I only brushed half because he said it hurt. He went to bed pretty easily but he looked so exhausted. About 10:00pm he woke up and he was sweaty and clammy. He wasn\u201dt feeling well and seemed a bit delirious because he didn\u201dt realize I was really in the room with him as I rocked him. He cried about his tummy hurting and pointed to below his belly button. He cried and said he wanted to go home. He didn\u201dt realize he was home.\n\nA 3-year-old girl from VAERS ID 2366237:\n\nThe night of the vaccine, she developed a fever and woke up. She has had a fever ever since the vaccine. She is lethargic and will not eat. I took her to the urgent care on 7/8/2022. She had a strep and COVID-19 test that were negative. Her highest fever was 104. I also took her to the ER yesterday. She is currently still sick.\n\nA one and a half year old boy from VAERS ID 2365977:\n\nAfter receiving vaccination, patient was out of it for approximately ~15 mins, after that period seemed lethargic but otherwise normal. Patient showed no other adverse reaction until time for his nap at 12:40p, when he felt warm to the touch but underarm temperature reading was 98.7. He woke up atypically early at 2:50p, but laid in crib seemingly playing quietly. At 3:56p, mother heard whimpering sound and went to check on patient who was convulsing and unconscious until EMS arrived at 4:03p, he was very hot but EMS was unable to get an accurate temperature reading. Convulsions stopped when paramedics arrived at approx. 4:03p and patient was unresponsive for an additional approx. 10 mins. Patient was placed under ice by EMS and had a temperature reading of 102.4 when he arrived Hospital in approx 20-30 mins later.\n\nA six-month-old baby boy from VAERS ID 2362981:\n\n24 hours post-vaccine baby had a BRUE (brief resolved unexplained event). While changing his diaper he went unresponsive and I questioned if he was breathing. I startled him back with shouting his name. He then became unresponsive again. This occurred 4-5 times over 1-2 minutes. I attempted startling and tryingg go to get a reaction and he became alert again.

        "Comments by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nMore evidence that the COVID-19 mass vaccination programs were specifically designed to reduce the world\u2019s population to fit the \u201cGreen Agenda\u201d that the earth can no longer support current population levels continues to be reported, as now statistics show declining birthrates worldwide following the COVID-19 vaccine roll outs in 2021.\n\nAs we have recently reported, the COVID-19 vaccines cause a higher percentage of miscarriages than even the abortion pills.\n\nIt is truly amazing to see how evil and criminal our health officials in government, such as CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, have become when they go on TV and blatantly lie to the American people about the safety and efficacy of these killer COVID vaccines. The pharma-funded corporate media is also complicit with mass murder and criminal intent to harm.\n\nThis is a worldwide catastrophe unfolding right before our eyes, as labor shortages are already crippling our economy due to how many people have died and been crippled by the vaccines, and now we see that there is little hope of replenishing the work force anytime soon, as birth rates rapidly decline and young, child-bearing adults become infertile.\n\nWe truly live in evil times!\n\nIf there is any small consolation in all of this, it is the fact that the \u201canti-vaccine\u201d people who still have their minds and souls in tact because they did not bow down and submit to these evil demonic tyrants, will be the ones who are still fertile and reproducing human life in the future.\n\nThe pro-Darwinian motto of \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d is going to take on a whole new meaning in the years ahead, if God does not completely destroy the planet first and start over with the promised Messianic New World Order.\n\nCovid Vaccines and Infertility\n\nWhy are birth rates plummeting in the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, Switzerland, and Taiwan \u2014 nine months after mass covid vaccinations?\n\nby KanekoaTheGreat\n\nGermany\n\nGermany reported a 13% decline in births between January and March 2022 compared to the same period in 2021.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom reported a 7.7% decline in births with 75,670 births between January and February 2022 compared to 82,042 births during the same period in 2021.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nIn Switzerland, birth rates have also plummeted since the introduction of the covid vaccines.\n\nTaiwan\n\nTaiwan reported a 23.2% decline in births in May 2022 compared to the same month in 2021.\n\nIgor Chudov, the author of a popular covid newsletter wrote, \u201cWhen expressed in \u201csigmas\u201d, units of standard deviation, the 23.24% drop in the birth rate in Taiwan is a 26-sigma event! This is can be described as \u201cunimaginable\u201d in terms of the likelihood of happening due to random chance.\u201d\n\nSweden\n\nSweden, without lockdown and school closures, reported a 6.6% decline with 35,454 births between January and April 2022 compared to 37,950 births during the same period in 2021.\n\nThe decline in birth rates is 6.9% for that same time period when compared to the average of 2019-2021.\n\nNetherlands\n\nNetherlands reported a 6.3% decline with 53,090 births between January and April 2022 compared to 56,671 births during the same period in 2021.\n\nIn conclusion, data from around the world shows a substantial monthly decrease in birth rates from January 2022 to April 2022 compared to previous years.\n\nBiodistribution studies show that Pfizer\u2019s mRNA vaccine lipid nanoparticles do end up in the ovaries and testes and subsequent studies have shown that covid-19 and covid vaccines lower sperm counts.\n\nFurthermore, the rate of fertility problems reported on the CDC\u2019s VAERS database for the covid vaccines are astronomical.\n\nPrior to the introduction of the mRNA vaccines, there were about 1,500 reports of fertility problems over the 31-year history of VAERS for all vaccines combined.\n\nThere are 15,000 reports of fertility issues from the covid vaccine alone, which accounts for 95% of all the fertility issues in the history of VAERS.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, there are more than 30,000 reports of menstrual changes after covid vaccinations.\n\nWhy are birth rates plummeting in the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, Switzerland, and Taiwan \u2014 nine months after the beginning of covid mass vaccinations?\n\nChildren are statistically at-or-near zero risk of being hospitalized or dying from covid-19.\n\nThe mass vaccination of children must stop now.\n\nRead the full article at Kanekoa\u2019s Newsletter.\n\nSee Also:\n\nCOVID-19 \u201cVaccine\u201d Casualties List\n\nSee Also:",
        "As the cost of essential goods rises faster than it has in decades, billionaires in the food and energy sectors are increasing their fortunes by $1 billion dollars every two days\n\nby OXFAM, Canada\n\nFor every new billionaire created during the pandemic \u2014 one every 30 hours \u2014 nearly a million people could be pushed into extreme poverty in 2022 at nearly the same rate, reveals a new Oxfam brief today.\n\n\u201cProfiting from Pain\u201d is published as the World Economic Forum in Davos takes place for the first time face-to-face since COVID-19, a period during which billionaires have enjoyed a huge boost to their fortunes.\n\nIn Canada, the wealth of billionaires has increased by 57.1 per cent since the beginning of the pandemic, in March 2020. The 41 richest billionaires own as much as the poorest 40 per cent of Canadians.\n\n\u201cBillionaires gathered in Davos have enjoyed an obscene surge in their fortunes over the last two years. The pandemic and now the steep rise in food and energy prices have been a bonanza for the wealthiest, while millions of people face hunger and poverty as the cost living shoots up,\u201d said Ian Thomson, manager of policy for Oxfam Canada.\n\nThe brief shows that 573 people became new billionaires during the pandemic, at the rate of one every 30 hours. We expect this year that 263 million more people will crash into extreme poverty, at a rate of a million people every 33 hours.\n\nBillionaires\u2019 wealth has risen more in the first 24 months of COVID-19 than in 23 years combined. The total wealth of the world\u2019s billionaires is now equivalent to 13.9 per cent of global GDP. This is a three-fold increase (up from 4.4 per cent) in 2000.\n\n\u201cBillionaire wealth is growing because the super-rich have rigged the system for decades and are now reaping the benefits. The wealthiest \u2014 most of whom are men \u2014 are benefiting from privatization, pharmaceutical monopolies, fossil fuel subsidies and rollbacks of workers\u2019 rights. Meanwhile, low-income people are working harder and earning less in pay,\u201d said Thomson. \u201cInequality risks tearing apart our societies if we don\u2019t stop it.\u201d\n\nOxfam\u2019s new research also reveals that corporations in the energy, food and pharmaceutical sectors \u2014 where monopolies are especially common \u2014 are posting record-high profits, even as wages have barely budged and workers struggle with decades-high prices amid COVID-19. The fortunes of food and energy billionaires have risen by $453 billion in the last two years, equivalent to $1 billion every two days. Five of the world\u2019s largest energy companies (BP, Shell, TotalEnergies, Exxon and Chevron) are together making $2,600 profit every second, and there are now 62 new food billionaires.\n\nFrom Sri Lanka to Sudan, record-high global food prices are sparking social and political upheaval. Sixty per cent of low-income countries are on the brink of debt distress. While inflation is rising everywhere, price hikes are particularly devastating for low-wage workers whose health and livelihoods were already most vulnerable to COVID-19, particularly women, racialized and marginalized people. People in poorer countries spend more than twice as much of their income on food than those in rich countries.\n\nToday, 2,668 billionaires \u2014 573 more than in 2020 \u2014 own $12.7 trillion, an increase of $3.78 trillion.\n\nThe world\u2019s 10 richest men own more wealth than the bottom 40 per cent of humanity, 3.1 billion people.\n\nThe richest 20 billionaires are worth more than the entire GDP of Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nA worker in the bottom 50 per cent would have to work for 112 years to earn what a person in the top one per cent gets in a single year.\n\nThe pandemic has created 40 new pharma billionaires. Pharmaceutical corporations like Moderna and Pfizer are making $1,000 profit every second just from their monopoly control of the COVID-19 vaccine, despite its development having been supported by billions of dollars in public investments. They are charging governments up to 24 times more than the potential cost of generic production. Eighty-seven per cent of people in low-income countries have still not been fully vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe extremely rich and powerful are profiting from pain and suffering. This is unconscionable. Some have grown rich by denying billions of people access to vaccines, others by exploiting rising food and energy prices. They are paying out massive bonuses and dividends while paying as little tax as possible. This rising wealth and rising poverty are two sides of the same coin, proof that our economic system is functioning exactly how the rich and powerful designed it to do,\u201d said Thomson. \u201cThe Canadian government talks a good game about taxing extreme wealth inequality but we need to see more action. In the last two federal budgets, new taxes on luxury goods and increased tax rates on big banks have been announced but not implemented. The true test will be if Canada and other major economies find the political will to finally tax billionaire wealth.\u201d\n\nRead the full report at OXFAM, Canada.\n\nSee Also:",
        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nThe roll out of the Monkeypox \u201cPlandemic\u201d has been carefully planned and coordinated, much like the COVID Plandemic of 2020, including having simulations on how this \u201cplandemic\u201d will evolve, much like the 2019 Event 201 which simulated, with almost precision accuracy, how the COVID plandemic would evolve. See:\n\nThis past weekend the World Health Organization officially declared the \u201cmonkeypox outbreak\u201d a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Kit Knightly of Off-Guardian.org reported:\n\nThe World Health Organization has officially declared the \u201cmonkeypox outbreak\u201d a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Following their second emergency meeting on monkeypox in less than a month, WHO Director-General Thedros Adhanom told the press: In short, we have an outbreak that has spread around the world rapidly through new modes of transmission about which we understand too little and which meets the criteria in the international health regulations [\u2026] For all of these reasons I have decided that the global monkeypox outbreak represents a global health emergency of international concern.\u201d For anyone living under a rock for the past two years, a PHEIC is defined as: an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response\u201d It is the highest alert WHO can issue, and grants them legal authority to issue travel warnings or restrictions, inspect and critique the public health measures of member states and other things of that nature. Exactly what that means in this instance, and what form the \u201ccoordinated international response\u201d will take, it is currently too early to tell. (Full article.)\n\nAn important event had to occur before this announcement, however, and that happened on Friday last week, when the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved Bavarian Nordic Smallpox/Monkeypox vaccine for distribution in Europe, so that Big Pharma can continue reaping windfall profits from vaccines that are supposed to stop \u201cplandemics\u201d:\n\nAs the monkeypox outbreak rapidly spreads across the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease a public health emergency and Bavarian Nordic received an extended approval for its vaccine. Bavarian Nordic\u2019s vaccine won an approval to prevent monkeypox after the company only applied for the extended label last month. Bavarian Nordic has already supplied the vaccine, called Imvanex in the EU, to many different, often unnamed, European countries. The vaccine, called Jynneos in the U.S., already had a monkeypox approval in the U.S. With the WHO declaring the outbreak a public health emergency, Bavarian Nordic\u2019s vaccine is a hot commodity. European regulators approved it to prevent monkeypox much faster than their usual 6 to 9 month review timeline. (Source.)\n\nThis vaccine, while approved by the FDA in the US and now by the EMA in Europe, is largely untested in the public, and there were very serious issues with rates of heart disease in the clinical trials, which are actually higher than the rates of heart disease for the experimental COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. See:\n\nThe World Health Organization has acknowledged that the vaccine is mostly untested, and that those being injected with the vaccine now are part of a \u201cclinical study\u201d for the purpose of data collecting so that researchers can learn more about the \u201ceffectiveness of the vaccine.\u201d\n\nAn official from the World Health Organization (WHO) admitted on Saturday that everyone who received the Monkeypox vaccine is considered to be part of a \u201cclinical study\u201d for the purpose of data collecting so that researchers can learn more about the \u201ceffectiveness of the vaccine.\u201d Tim Nguyen, the Unit Head of Global Infectious Hazards Preparedness at the World Health Organization Emergency Programme, said that the vaccine efficacy is yet unknown since it has never been used on this scale before. \u201cI would like to underline one thing that is very important to WHO. We do have uncertainty around the effectiveness of these vaccines because they haven\u2019t been used in this context and in this scale before,\u201d Tim Nguyen stressed. Nguyen warned that anyone who received the Monkeypox vaccination is technically participating in a \u201cclinical trial\u201d to determine the vaccine\u2019s efficacy. \u201cAnd therefore, when these vaccines are being developed, that they are delivered in the context of clinical trial studies and prospectively collecting this data to increase our understanding of the effectiveness of these vaccines,\u201d he said. (Read the full article at Gateway Pundit.)\n\nAnd perhaps the most interesting aspect of this planned and coordinated MonkeyPox \u201coutbreak\u201d was reported by The Expos\u00e9 yesterday, where their investigation revealed that the only countries where these \u201coutbreaks\u201d of MonkeyPox are happening are only in countries where the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine has been injected into the citizens of those countries in mass vaccination campaigns.\n\nRussia and China, therefore, are allegedly not seeing these MonkeyPox \u201coutbreaks,\u201d and \u201ccoincidentally\u201d they did not mass vaccinate their populations with American-made Pfizer COVID vaccines, but used their own, locally produced, COVID vaccines.\n\n\u201cMonkeypox\u201d is only circulating in countries where the Pfizer Vaccine has been distributed & is being used to advance a Technocratic Great Reset\n\nby The Expos\u00e9\n\nSince around the middle of May 2022, you will have most likely heard or seen the word Monkeypox mentioned numerous times in the mainstream media.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t then you\u2019re about to.\n\nThis is because on Saturday 23rd July 2022, the Director General of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros, overruled the World Health Organization to single-handedly declare the alleged monkeypox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. (Source)\n\nAllegedly, for the first time since its discovery among humans in Africa over 50 years ago, the monkeypox virus is circulating throughout several countries including the USA, UK, Canada, Brazil, Australia and most of Europe all at the same time.\n\nBut it just so happens that every single country where monkeypox is allegedly circulating is also a country that has distributed the Pfizer Covid-19 injection to its population; excluding some countries in Africa where the disease has been endemic for the past 50 or so years.\n\nThe World Health Organization has not received a single report of monkeypox from any country in the world where the Pfizer vaccine was not administered.\n\nWhy is this?\n\nWell, it\u2019s most definitely not because we\u2019re witnessing what we will soon be told is a second pandemic to hit the world within the past two years.\n\nIt\u2019s because we\u2019re seeing the consequences of injecting millions of people with an experimental mRNA injection that causes untold damage to the immune system, and public health authorities are now scrambling to cover up Covid-19 vaccine-induced shingles and using it as an opportunity to advance their technocratic agenda of implementing \u2018The Great Reset\u2019.\n\nClick on the below image and take a good long look to compare which countries have reported cases of monkeypox to the W.H.O. since May 2022, and which countries have distributed the Pfizer Covid-19 injection.\n\nEvery single country that has reported cases of monkeypox has also distributed the Pfizer jab. And there are only a handful of countries where the Pfizer jab has been administered that haven\u2019t reported a case of monkeypox to the W.H.O.\n\nHuman monkeypox was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo in a 9-year-old boy. Since then, human cases of monkeypox have been reported in 11 African countries. It wasn\u2019t until 2003 that the first monkeypox outbreak outside of Africa was recorded, and this was in the United States.\n\nDo you not find it curious how in the space of 50 years, monkeypox has never really gotten off the ground outside of a couple of countries in Africa, but then within two years of the alleged emergence of Covid-19, monkeypox is suddenly in every Western nation and being hyped up by public health authorities, the mainstream media and the World Health Organization?\n\nDo you not find it curious how every country reporting cases of monkeypox has also distributed the Pfizer vaccine to its population?\n\nIf you don\u2019t then we urge you to please stop watching BBC News, because how the world appears to you is absolute fiction.\n\nAccording to a scientific study published in 1988, it\u2019s virtually impossible to distinguish between monkeypox and chickenpox. And chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, and just like its close relative the herpes simplex virus, it becomes a lifelong resident in the body.\n\nAnd like its other cousin, genital herpes, varicella may be silent for many years, hiding out inside nerve cells and can reactivate later, wreaking havoc in the form of the excruciating skin disorder, shingles, which is a blistering, burning skin rash.\n\nWhat you\u2019re being told is \u201cmonkeypox\u201d is really Covid-19 vaccine-induced herpes infection, shingles, autoimmune blistering disease and other ailments brought on by a weakened immune system caused by Covid-19 vaccination.\n\nAccording to the CDC Wonder Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database, as of June 3rd 2022, the CDC has processed 18,026 reports relating to herpes and shingle infections that have occurred as adverse reactions to the Covid-19 injections.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the same VAERS database, the CDC only received 1,052 reports relating to herpes/shingle infections that have occurred as adverse reactions to all available Flu jabs between the years 2008 and 2020.\n\nThis figure alone shows there has been a 1,614% increase in adverse events related to herpes/shingles because of the Covid-19 injections.\n\nThis isn\u2019t because more Covid-19 injections have been administered.\n\nAccording to the CDC, 1.7 billion Flu jabs were administered between 2008 and 2020 (source). But according to \u2018Our World in Data\u2019, only 588.04 million Covid-19 jabs were administered in the USA as of May 27th 2022.\n\nNow that we know these figures we can use them to calculate the rate of adverse events related to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses administered.\n\nThe results are as follows \u2013\n\nhe available data shows the rate of adverse events relating to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses of Covid-19 injection administered is 4,925% higher than the rate of adverse events relating to herpes/shingles infections per 1 million doses of Flu vaccine administered.\n\nTherefore, this official U.S. Government data proves that Covid-19 vaccination increases a person\u2019s risk of developing Shingles by 4,925% at the very least.\n\nThe confidential Pfizer documents that the FDA attempted to delay releasing by 75 years also list another condition that has extreme similarities to monkeypox: autoimmune blistering disease.\n\nThe condition is hidden within the 9 page long list of adverse events of special interest at the end of Pfizer\u2019s reissue_5.3.6 postmarketing experience.pdf document.\n\nAutoimmune blistering disease causes blisters on the skin and mucous membranes throughout the body. It can affect the mouth, nose, throat, eyes, and genitals. It is not fully understood but \u201cexperts\u201d believe that it is triggered when a person who has a genetic tendency to get this condition comes into contact with an environmental trigger. This might be a chemical or a medicine. Such as the Pfizer Covid-19 injection?\n\nThose same Pfizer documents also list herpes viral infections as adverse events of special interest in relation to the mRNA Covid-19 injection.\n\nBy the end of February 2021, just 2 months after the Pfizer vaccine was granted emergency use authorisation in both the USA and UK, Pfizer has received 8,152 reports relating to herpes infection, and 18 of these had already led to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.\n\nWhy is the Pfizer vaccine causing all these diseases that bear remarkable similarities to the alleged monkeypox disease we\u2019re all being told about? It\u2019s because it decimates the natural immune system.\n\nThe following chart shows the Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness among the triple vaccinated population in England according to data found in the UK Health Security Agency\u2019s Week 3, Week 7 and Week 13 COVID-19 Vaccine Surveillance reports of 2022 \u2013\n\nData shows that vaccine effectiveness fell month on month since at least the beginning of 2022, with the lowest effectiveness recorded among 60-69-year-olds at a shocking minus-391%. This age group also experienced the sharpest decline, falling from minus-104.69% in week 3.\n\nA negative vaccine effectiveness indicates immune system damage because vaccine effectiveness isn\u2019t really a measure of the effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccine. It is a measure of a vaccine recipient\u2019s immune system performance compared to the immune system performance of an unvaccinated person.\n\nWhy isn\u2019t it a measure of the Covid-19 vaccine? Because the injection invades our cells, and manipulates our DNA, instructing it to create millions of the alleged spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus. The immune system then attempts to rid the body of these spike proteins and the theory is that it should remember to do it again in the future if it ever encounters the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nSo if the immune system is not only failing to do that but doing a far worse job than the immune system of an unvaccinated person, as the above UKHSA data proves, this means the Covid-19 injections have damaged and are continuing to damage the immune system over a long period of time.\n\nThis is in turn leading to flare-ups of herpes infections resulting in conditions such as shingles, auto-immune blistering disease and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and you are being told it is monkeypox.\n\nBut you\u2019re not just being told this to cover it up, the authorities are also using it to advance their technocratic agenda.\n\nA hidden alliance of political and corporate leaders exploited the alleged Covid-19 pandemic with the aim of crashing national economies and paving the way to introducing a global digital currency. These leaders include President of France Emmanuel Macron, Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern, and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson.\n\n\u201cMonkeypox\u201d is going to allow them to reintroduce a campaign of fear and enforce further Draconian restrictions, and it is their ticket to implementing a digital identity / social credit system in which the basic human rights that we have all taken from granted will be lost forever.\n\nSince the turn of the year, numerous countries have announced plans to expand online censorship, introduce what are in effect social credit systems, and implement digital identities whilst floating the idea of introducing national digital currencies.\n\nHere\u2019s a list of articles relating to just a few examples \u2013\n\nBut for this to work, the authorities, which have been infiltrated by World Economic Forum technocrats (source), need the public to be on side.\n\nAnd they know through the mass majority of people\u2019s unquestioning compliance with Covid-19 restrictions over the past two years that this won\u2019t be a problem, especially when they have the bought and paid for mainstream media to help them.\n\nRead the full article at The Expos\u00e9\n\nSee Also:",
        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nIn a sign that perhaps even the pro-pharma pro-vaccine medical professionals are starting to get tired of the constant COVID hype and are beginning to speak out against health politicians who are appointed bureaucrats and never elected by the people to their public office, LA County Chief Medical Officer Dr. Brad Spellberg went public recently to humiliate Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer\u2019s announcement that COVID-19 cases were on the rise and new face mask mandates were needed soon.\n\nKaty Grimes of The Globe reports:\n\n\u2026. Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer\u2019s announcement on Thursday that Los Angeles County has officially reached the \u201cHigh\u201d level of new COVID-19 cases and County hospitalization rates, giving the County two weeks to fall back below or else mandatory indoor masking mandates return\u2026 In a news conference on July 13, Brad Spellberg, the chief medical officer of Los Angeles County and University of Southern California Medical Center, and epidemiologist Paul Holtom, said that there have been no changes in the transmission levels of COVID-19. \u201cOur Covid situation \u2013 it\u2019s just the same. It has not changed,\u201d Spellberg said. He showed a graph and said, \u201cit\u2019s plateaued and has not gone down.\u201d Dr. Spellberg said they are seeing thousands of people with Covid, \u201cbut it is mild, and they go home,\u201d he said. He said of the patients who are admitted to the hospital, \u201c90% of the time it is not due to Covid. Only 10% of our Covid-positive admissions are due to Covid.\u201d \u201cNone of them go to the ICU, and when they do, it is not for pneumonia,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are not intibated. We have not seen one of those since February.\u201d \u201cA lot of people have really bad colds is what we are seeing, Spellberg said. \u201c\u2019It is just not the same pandemic that it was, despite all the media hype to the contrary\u2026 I mean \u2026 a lot of people have bad colds is what we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Spellberg added.\u201d (Full article.)\n\nLater in the day today, Grimes published a second article at The Globe regarding the reaction of the Health Department, which of course must have a public \u201chealth crisis\u201d at all times always to justify their bloated budget and reason for existence.\n\nIt appears there must have been some significant blowback against Los Angeles County over of the information provided by the two surprisingly forthright LA County+USC physicians on Sunday, as the Globe reported Monday in LA County Chief Medical Officer Rejects COVID-19 \u2018Media Hype\u2019. We reported that the two LA doctors rejected Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer\u2019s statements about another wave of COVID-19 hitting the region as \u201cmedia hype.\u201d The L.A. County Department of Health issued a statement Monday, clearly indignant that people shared the video on social media and in news articles of the two doctors rejecting the claims that hospitalizations are up, and that Covid is still very serious. Ferrer has been teasing that with the impending \u201chigh\u201d level of COVID-19 transmission,\u201d indoor mask mandates will likely come back. But as is her way, she never offered any details about whether or not people who were hospitalized were sick with Covid or from Covid \u2013 or if they were not sick much at all. The letter is almost funny claiming that it is because of the vaccines that people aren\u2019t hospitalized. Sure. \u201cImportantly, one of the reasons we are seeing low rates of ICU admission currently is due to high rates of vaccination across Los Angeles County,\u201d the unsigned letter from LA County Health Services says. It\u2019s almost as if these two doctors may have exposed the Los Angeles County Medical Industrial Complex. (Full article.)\n\nSee Also:",

(Source.)\n\nA 2011 report by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Inc. for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) stated that less than 1% of all adverse events following vaccines are ever reported to VAERS.\n\nAlthough 25% of ambulatory patients experience an adverse drug event, less than 0.3% of all adverse drug events and 1-13% of serious events are reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nA recording of a phone call between an irate father and a pharmacist who injected his 7-year-old son with a COVID-19 vaccine after his wife brought him to the pharmacy behind his back, and is now allegedly in the hospital due to myocarditis, has been circulating in the alternative media today.\n\nThe father and his family apparently live in New Zealand, while his work originates in New York, and what is remarkable about the call is that the father asks the pharmacist if parents are warned about the risks to myocarditis and heart disease before giving the COVID-19 shots to children, and the pharmacist replies:\n\nWe might scare the parents, and they don\u2019t want to get their child vaccinated.\n\nThis is on our Bitchute channel, and is also on our Odysee channel and Telegram channel as well.\n\nI found a couple of transcripts of the dialog, and this one (I found it on The Vigilant Fox) seems to be the most complete:\n\nFather: Are you a pharmacist?\n\nPharmacist: Yes, how can I help?\n\nFather: Yeah. Hey, I\u2019ve got a question. My wife, against my wishes, brought my seven-year-old son a few days ago for a COVID jab, and he\u2019s now in the hospital with myocarditis. And I was obviously not very happy with you guys or with my wife. She told me that she was not told that was a potential side effect. So why wouldn\u2019t you have told her that?\n\nPharmacist: Okay \u2014 sorry. So it\u2019s quite a rare side effect as well.\n\nFather: No, it\u2019s not. No, it\u2019s not because I\u2019ve been doing research; it\u2019s common. In the US, there\u2019s tens of thousands of them [myocarditis cases] reported to the CDC site. So why are you not telling parents this?\n\nPharmacist: We might scare the parents, and they don\u2019t want to get their child vaccinated.\n\nFather: So you don\u2019t want to scare the parents with something that is actually happening, that\u2019s happened to my kid? Are you out of your mind? Are you out of your mind? You don\u2019t want to scare them? You need to give them the right information so they can make a proper decision! What is wrong with you? You don\u2019t want to scare them. I\u2019m recording this conversation as well, and this is going to a lawyer next. Thank you for admitting that. So why don\u2019t you tell them? When someone comes in there and says, \u201cHey, what can go wrong?\u201d What do you say? \u201cSore arm\u201d? Have you seen the amount of dead people? Have you seen it?\n\nPharmacist: Has your wife asked before giving consent to give [the child the shot]?\n\nFather: She asked what the side effects are!\n\nPharmacist: She asked? I\u2019m not sure because I wasn\u2019t there.\n\nFather: It doesn\u2019t matter! You\u2019re supposed to tell people this can happen. So you know what the prognosis is? You know what it is? Possible death within five years. 20% of people with myocarditis die! It is a permanent, damaged heart. It is not temporary! He\u2019s facing a heart transplant because of you! Because you didn\u2019t want to scare her! You know no kids have died from COVID, not a single healthy kid, and you\u2019re giving this stuff out, and you\u2019re not warning people? What is wrong with you?\n\nPharmacist: So there are information online that you can look up \u2014\n\nFather: No! No! You gave the shot. When someone comes in there and asks what the side effects are, you don\u2019t NOT say because it might scare them from the shot. What is wrong with you?\n\nPharmacist: So the benefit of getting a vaccination is \u2014 solely giving a vaccination because the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nFather: No, it isn\u2019t! Do you know I\u2019m looking at a Johns Hopkins study? There have been 400 people under 18 die in the United States. 330 million people. Not one of them was healthy. They had cancer, leukemia, obesity, something wrong with them. Not one kid has died or ended up in the hospital. So the benefits are ZERO to my kid! Why did you not tell them? It\u2019s up to you to tell them. Then we make a decision. Not you! You tell us, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s rare, but it happens. You didn\u2019t tell her that, did you?\n\nPharmacist: I\u2019m not sure. I wasn\u2019t the vaccinator \u2014\n\nFather: You said you\u2019re not doing it. So when the next kid walks in there with a mother for a shot, are you going to tell them, \u201cHey, I just got a call from someone; their kid\u2019s heart is destroyed. Keep that in mind; that can happen.\u201d Are you going to tell them that? Are you?\n\nPharmacist: I cannot answer you that.\n\nFather: Well, why can\u2019t you because it\u2019s going to go in a court, and you\u2019ll answer it. You just admitted that you don\u2019t tell people because you don\u2019t want to scare them. It\u2019s recorded; I\u2019ve recorded everything.\n\nPharmacist: Sorry, I wasn\u2019t the pharmacist that did the vaccination.\n\nFather: It doesn\u2019t matter; you just said it! You just said that you don\u2019t tell people.\n\nPharmacist: I don\u2019t know what the situation is, so I don\u2019t know what she told in the vaccination error. I\u2019m not sure. I cannot speak on behalf of the pharmacist that vaccinated.\n\nFather: You just told me you don\u2019t tell people because you might scare them. I have it on a recording. You want me to play it back? Every call \u2014 because I\u2019m in finance \u2014 every call is recorded. Every email I sent is recorded. Every message I sent must be recorded because I work out of New York, and I live in New Zealand. It\u2019s all recorded because the SFC requires it. You are recorded. So you\u2019re telling people \u2014 you\u2019re not telling them they could get damaged, so in case you scare them from taking a shot that can kill them, right? Is that correct? Are you brain dead? What is wrong with you?\n\nPharmacist: Sorry, I don\u2019t think we should con \u2014 continue this conversation.\n\nFather: No, we should because are you going to tell people this is a risk when they come through there? My kid\u2019s screwed! You screwed him. What about everyone else? What are you going to do? You ruined a life! It\u2019s on you for the rest of your life. This kid is screwed because of you because your policy there is to not tell people that these vaccines are dangerous and deadly. Have you seen all the people dying in their sleep? Hundreds of them? Have you seen yesterday? An NFL first-round draft pick, 24 [years old] died? An NBA first-round draft pick died four days ago, dead after the shot. Are you seeing that? Are you sitting there in your bubble collecting your 50 bucks every shot you give, you murderer? So what are you going to do? Are you going to tell parents? Are you going to say, \u201cLook, this is what can happen; it\u2019s not a sore shoulder\u201d? That\u2019s usual, but they can ruin their lives. How do you feel about that you\u2019re ruining lives? Are you going to tell them or not? Are you going to continue to do this?\n\nPharmacist: Um \u2014 that\u2019s not the decision that I make.\n\nFather: It isn\u2019t? So you\u2019re just going to tell people, \u201cOh, nothing can go wrong,\u201d and more kids are going to end up in the hospital with ruined hearts, right? That\u2019s the plan? Because you can\u2019t make that decision. And you\u2019d hate for them not to take the shot, eh? Because then you don\u2019t get your 50 bucks, do you?\n\nPharmacist: So we always ask consent for the parent before we do the vaccinations.\n\nFather: Yeah, but you don\u2019t tell them what can go wrong! Of course, you asked consent. The parent came there with that kid. It\u2019s obvious consent. Why are you not telling them what can go wrong? I\u2019m sure they\u2019re asking. But you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, no. Nothing goes wrong. Just a sore shoulder.\u201d Right? You don\u2019t tell them that the crazy guy called you and said his kid\u2019s life is ruined because of what you did a few days ago. Do you or will you? You are sick! You are sick! You are twisted. You are evil. You\u2019re a monster. You\u2019re wrecking lives. You\u2019re killing babies. You\u2019re killing children. You\u2019re killing mothers. You\u2019re disgusting. Totally disgusting. Do you not see that? You need to at least tell them \u201cThis can go wrong,\u201d because when you don\u2019t, this happens! Don\u2019t you see that?\n\nThe next part is very expletive. I do not agree with the name-calling here, but I do understand the frustration from the parent.\n\nFather: Are you so f*cking stupid? You f*cking murdering bitch! F*ck! And you\u2019re going to continue to do it! \u201cOh, I don\u2019t make that.\u201d You f*cking moron. You are f*cking sick in the brain.

        "by The Expos\u00e9\n\nThe UK Medicine Regulator has confirmed that over a period of nineteen months the Covid-19 Vaccines have caused at least 5.5x as many deaths as all other available vaccines combined in the past 21 years.\n\nThis means, that when compared side by side, the Covid-19 injections are a shocking 7,402% more deadly than every other vaccine available in the UK.\n\nA Freedom of Information request was made via email to the Medicine and Healthcare product Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on the 6th August 2021 in which a Mr Anderson asked the MHRA the following questions \u2013\n\nHow many Deaths have there been from all Covid-19 vaccines?\n\nAre there any other reporting AI system monitoring systems like the Yellow Card scheme?\n\nAre Covid-19 Vaccines still in trials?\n\nHow many deaths has there been in last 20 years by previous Vaccines without Covid-19 Vaccines?\n\nWhat happens if a there is a new vaccine or new drug? What process and monitoring do they go through?\n\nWhat cut off point will the MHRA say a vaccine or drug is unsafe for humans?\n\nThe MHRA responded with the usual \u201cwe do not hold this information\u201d, as seen time and time again from Government departments.\n\nHowever, they did confirm that they are using other epidemiological studies, anonymised GP-based electronic healthcare records and international experience to proactively monitor safety alongside the spontaneous reports received via the Yellow Card scheme.\n\nThe MHRA also confirmed that the current Covid-19 vaccines on offer in the United Kingdom are only under a temporary authorisation and that these authorisations do not constitute a marketing authorisation.\n\nIn answer to the question asked on the number of deaths due to all other vaccines in the past twenty years the MHRA provided the usual robotic response about how great the Covid-19 vaccines are and how they are the \u201csingle most effective treatment for preventing serious illness due to Covid-19\u201d but what they did not do is say that they \u201cdo not hold this information\u201d.\n\nInstead, they revealed that they had received a total of 404 reported adverse reactions to all available vaccines (excluding the Covid-19 injections) associated with a fatal outcome between the 1st January 2001 and the 25th August 2021 \u2013 a time frame of 20 years and 8 months.\n\nBut how does that fare against the number of reported adverse reactions to all temporarily authorised Covid-19 vaccines associated with a fatal outcome?\n\nWell, since the Pfizer injection was rolled out in December 2020 there have been 808 reported deaths as of 13th July 22, meaning that in just 19 months, this \u201cvaccine\u201d alone outnumbers the deaths due to all other vaccines combined in the past 20 years.\n\nHowever, the AstraZeneca viral vector injection has fared much worse with 1,294 deaths being reported to the MHRA since January 2020, more than three times as many deaths as what has been reported due to all other vaccines in the past 20 years.\n\nThere have also been 62 reported deaths due to the Moderna jab since it was first administered in June 2021, and 49 deaths where the brand of Covid-19 vaccine was not specified in the report.\n\nTherefore, up to July 13th 2022, there have been a grand total of 2,213 deaths reported to the MHRA as adverse reactions to all available Covid-19 vaccines in the United Kingdom since the beginning of 2021.\n\nMeaning there have officially been 5.5x as many deaths in just 19 months due to the Covid-19 vaccines than there have been due to every other available vaccine combined since the year 2001.\n\nTwenty years and 8 months is a period that is 13.7 x longer than the nineteen-month period where the Covid-19 vaccines have been rolled out.\n\nTherefore, the number of deaths reported to all other vaccines combined in the same time frame of nineteen months equates to 29.5 deaths.\n\nThis means the Covid-19 injections are proving to be a shocking 7,402% more deadly than every other vaccine available in the UK.",

        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nWe are now seeing more records of side effects from the pediatric COVID-19 vaccines for the most recent age group authorized by the FDA, babies and toddlers between the ages of 6 months and 4 years old. This age group was authorized to be injected with COVID-19 vaccines less than 1 month ago, on June 17th.\n\nIn the most recent update to the national Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database this past Friday (July 8, 2022), 123 new records were added to this age group, with 137 cases now recorded since the FDA authorization. (Source.)\n\nAs we reported on July 6th, when the first few cases were beginning to show up in VAERS for the babies and toddlers, hallucinations are a very troubling side effect in this very young age group.\n\nWith these 137 cases recorded in the past few weeks, other troubling side effects including brain injuries, seizures, and skin rashes are showing up in the database.\n\n27 of the 137 cases listed \u201cNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome\u201d as a side effect.\n\nCleveland Clinic defines \u201cNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome\u201d as:\n\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare and life-threatening reaction to the use of any neuroleptic medication. Neuroleptics, also known as antipsychotic medications, treat and manage symptoms of many psychiatric conditions. (Source.)\n\nI am tempted to write my emotional reaction to this news, but I want to keep this clean and G-rated.\n\nWhat kind of parent would willingly inject their baby with something that has the same \u201crare and life-threatening reaction\u201d as antipsychotic drugs?? No wonder some of these babies and toddlers are hallucinating!\n\nOther side effects among these first 137 cases recorded in VAERS for babies and toddlers who are injected with the COVID-19 vaccines are: anaphylactic shock, dementia, depression, lupus, pancreatitis, colitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, encephalitis, seizures, meningitis, and all sorts of rashes. (Source.)\n\nThe most common reason for recording a case to submit to VAERS for this age group, by far, is \u201cmedication error,\u201d where the pharmacist or doctor injected the baby with the wrong dose, either an adult dose, or a dose for an older child.\n\nSuch gross incompetency among medical staff should not surprise us, since most of the good, ethical doctors have quit or been fired over their refusal to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, or inject others with one. The ones remaining are either vaccine zealots, or worse, they know full well that these vaccines are killing and harming children, but they fear losing their job more than standing up for what is right.\n\nAs I read through the write-ups of each of these cases, it is clear that many of the toddlers are putting up a fight to resist being injected, but if it results in only getting a partial dose of the vaccine, they just inject them again.\n\nI also noted in several of the write-ups that instead of referring to the \u201cparent\u201d of the child, reference is made to the \u201cguardian,\u201d which suggests that some of these babies and toddlers are in the foster care system, where their \u201cguardians\u201d have no choice but to inject their \u201cfoster children\u201d because the child is technically a ward of the State, and the State has the right to administer any medical procedure, even experimental ones, without parental notification.\n\nPlease pray for America\u2019s children, as the United States is one of the few, if not only, places in the world where babies this young are being injected with these toxic shots.\n\nThose who are participating in this Satanic ritual will be held accountable at some point, and the Judge of the universe will not accept ignorance as an excuse, even if your \u201cpastor,\u201d or the nurse or doctor at your church, told you that these vaccines are \u201csafe,\u201d and you trusted them.\n\nChristian churches are one of the most dangerous places for children today, because if you refuse to submit to the Satanic practice of vaccinating your child, you risk being reported to CPS and having your child medically kidnapped where they will remove them from your home and put them into a nice \u201cChristian\u201d foster home where they will receive all recommended medical procedures.\n\nRescue those being led away to death; hold back those staggering toward slaughter. If you say, \u201cBut we knew nothing about this,\u201d does not he who weighs the heart perceive it? Does not he who guards your life know it? Will he not repay each person according to what he has done? (Proverbs 24:11-12)\n\nSee Also:\n\nCOVID-19 \u201cVaccine\u201d Casualties List\n\nSee Also:",
        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nA recording of a phone call between an irate father and a pharmacist who injected his 7-year-old son with a COVID-19 vaccine after his wife brought him to the pharmacy behind his back, and is now allegedly in the hospital due to myocarditis, has been circulating in the alternative media today.\n\nThe father and his family apparently live in New Zealand, while his work originates in New York, and what is remarkable about the call is that the father asks the pharmacist if parents are warned about the risks to myocarditis and heart disease before giving the COVID-19 shots to children, and the pharmacist replies:\n\nWe might scare the parents, and they don\u2019t want to get their child vaccinated.\n\nThis is on our Bitchute channel, and is also on our Odysee channel and Telegram channel as well.\n\nI found a couple of transcripts of the dialog, and this one (I found it on The Vigilant Fox) seems to be the most complete:\n\nFather: Are you a pharmacist?\n\nPharmacist: Yes, how can I help?\n\nFather: Yeah. Hey, I\u2019ve got a question. My wife, against my wishes, brought my seven-year-old son a few days ago for a COVID jab, and he\u2019s now in the hospital with myocarditis. And I was obviously not very happy with you guys or with my wife. She told me that she was not told that was a potential side effect. So why wouldn\u2019t you have told her that?\n\nPharmacist: Okay \u2014 sorry. So it\u2019s quite a rare side effect as well.\n\nFather: No, it\u2019s not. No, it\u2019s not because I\u2019ve been doing research; it\u2019s common. In the US, there\u2019s tens of thousands of them [myocarditis cases] reported to the CDC site. So why are you not telling parents this?\n\nPharmacist: We might scare the parents, and they don\u2019t want to get their child vaccinated.\n\nFather: So you don\u2019t want to scare the parents with something that is actually happening, that\u2019s happened to my kid? Are you out of your mind? Are you out of your mind? You don\u2019t want to scare them? You need to give them the right information so they can make a proper decision! What is wrong with you? You don\u2019t want to scare them. I\u2019m recording this conversation as well, and this is going to a lawyer next. Thank you for admitting that. So why don\u2019t you tell them? When someone comes in there and says, \u201cHey, what can go wrong?\u201d What do you say? \u201cSore arm\u201d? Have you seen the amount of dead people? Have you seen it?\n\nPharmacist: Has your wife asked before giving consent to give [the child the shot]?\n\nFather: She asked what the side effects are!\n\nPharmacist: She asked? I\u2019m not sure because I wasn\u2019t there.\n\nFather: It doesn\u2019t matter! You\u2019re supposed to tell people this can happen. So you know what the prognosis is? You know what it is? Possible death within five years. 20% of people with myocarditis die! It is a permanent, damaged heart. It is not temporary! He\u2019s facing a heart transplant because of you! Because you didn\u2019t want to scare her! You know no kids have died from COVID, not a single healthy kid, and you\u2019re giving this stuff out, and you\u2019re not warning people? What is wrong with you?\n\nPharmacist: So there are information online that you can look up \u2014\n\nFather: No! No! You gave the shot. When someone comes in there and asks what the side effects are, you don\u2019t NOT say because it might scare them from the shot. What is wrong with you?\n\nPharmacist: So the benefit of getting a vaccination is \u2014 solely giving a vaccination because the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nFather: No, it isn\u2019t! Do you know I\u2019m looking at a Johns Hopkins study? There have been 400 people under 18 die in the United States. 330 million people. Not one of them was healthy. They had cancer, leukemia, obesity, something wrong with them. Not one kid has died or ended up in the hospital. So the benefits are ZERO to my kid! Why did you not tell them? It\u2019s up to you to tell them. Then we make a decision. Not you! You tell us, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s rare, but it happens. You didn\u2019t tell her that, did you?\n\nPharmacist: I\u2019m not sure. I wasn\u2019t the vaccinator \u2014\n\nFather: You said you\u2019re not doing it. So when the next kid walks in there with a mother for a shot, are you going to tell them, \u201cHey, I just got a call from someone; their kid\u2019s heart is destroyed.

        "Novavax vaccine contains 1 mcg of insect (the fall armyworm) and baculovirus proteins and a bit of their DNA too, which is injected into you with each dose\n\nAnd that\u2019s before we consider the Matrix-M novel adjuvant it contains\n\nby Dr. Meryl Nass\n\nMeryl\u2019s COVID Newsletter\n\nYou see, the vaccine\u2019s spike protein is grown by genetically engineering baculoviruses to produce spike, and then infecting insect cells with the baculovirus to turn the whole thing into a spike protein factory.\n\nAt the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting that I live-blogged last week, it was revealed that the Novavax vaccine was being rolled out because it could be marketed as a \u201cmore traditional\u201d vaccine, since it was not made from mRNA. Novavax was to be directed to the unvaccinated, although only 10% of the unvaccinated, it was anticipated, would accept it.\n\nThe fact that no fetal cells were used in its development was claimed to be a marketing plus. However, thanks to a reader, it turns out that a human fetal cell line, (HEK) 293F, was used in the testing of the vaccine, as described in an article in Science.\n\nNOTHING about this vaccine is traditional.\n\nFirst, the Novavax company does not own a manufacturing plant, so the vaccine being distributed in the US is made at the Serum Institute of India.\n\nSecond, the adjuvant, Matrix-M (a nonspecific, potent immune stimulant) has never been used before. It is made from the Quillaja saponaria tree. There is another adjuvant that is only used in one (highly reactogenic) US vaccine, Shingrix, which is an extract from this tree. This GSK adjuvant, named ASO1B, contains QS-21, a single extract in the Shingrix vaccine.\n\nThe problem is that we don\u2019t know what extracts from the tree are included in Matrix-M. The information is proprietary! The Matrix-M adjuvant uses two unspecified \u201cfractions\u201d from the Q. saponaria tree, and there exist no data on its safety. (Matrix-M does not contain QS-21, although the company sometimes implies it does, to distract from its novelty.) These two fractions, combined with phospholipids and cholesterol, form the 40 nanometer particles of Matrix M.\n\nWhile the tree extracts are potent immune stimulants, all those characterized also have significant toxicity.\n\nThird, in addition to getting 5 mcg of spike protein in every dose, you will receive 1 mcg of residual amounts of baculovirus and Sf9 cell proteins (\u2264 0.96 mcg), and baculovirus and cellular [from the fall armyworm] DNA (\u2264 0.00016 mcg), according to the FDA.\n\nSo, you are getting an additional 20% protein of insect and baculovirus origin in addition to the 5 mcg of spike protein, in each of your two doses.\n\nThe fall armyworm\n\nIn other words, the Novavax vaccine is not sufficiently purified. And no one can tell you how the insect and viral protein and DNA contaminants will affect you.\n\nAnyone who tells you that the Novavax vaccine is a traditional protein vaccine is a scoundrel. This vaccine is another \u201cbait and switch\u201d being rolled out solely to entice the unvaccinated, because it is not made of mRNA.\n\n* But it still gives you a big dose of the spike poison.\n\nThere is a single other vaccine in the US that uses the fall armyworm-baculovirus platform to produce viral proteins.

        "by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nIs there any more doubt that the COVID-19 plandemic, which was used to transfer America\u2019s wealth to Big Pharma with literally TRILLIONS of taxpayer funds transferred into their accounts, has now allowed Pfizer to have complete control of the country by buying the White House and President of the United States?\n\nIt began with fellow billionaire Donald Trump, of course, in 2020 who strong-armed the FDA into giving fast-track emergency use authorization to Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine. (This is from our Bitchute channel.)\n\nThen Biden was installed as President and kept the coffers full, and now that 80% of Americans have already received a COVID-19 vaccine and demand is waning, with 98 million doses of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine currently sitting unused due to lack of demand, the call was put in to Joe this week to keep the faucet running, and the White House obliged and pledged another $9 BILLION for 300 million more doses of the deadly COVID-19 shots.\n\nTrump and Biden might disagree on a lot of things, but Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines ain\u2019t one of them. (This is also on our Bitchute channel.)\n\nThe top three firms who hold the most stock in Pfizer are Vanguard, Blackrock, and State Street (source), and there probably are very few investment firms who do NOT own some Pfizer stock, so when you see officials with the FDA, CDC, and others promoting Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines, they are probably all shareholders and cashing in, as are most members of Congress (unfortunately, these records at opensecrets.org only go through 2018; it would be interesting to see from 2020 and later.)\n\nOf course we\u2019ve known for a long time that Pfizer owns most of the corporate media:\n\nAnd they are the largest criminal organization in the world, based on settled criminal cases with the Department of Justice.\n\nDrug Cartel: Biden Admin agrees to pay Pfizer 56% more for their COVID shot\n\nThe pharma giant is already shattering profit records, and is expected to generate well over $100 billion in 2022 revenue.\n\nby Jordan Schachtel\n\nThe Dossier\n\nPfizer is already swimming in record profits, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the drug company from gouging the American taxpayer for every last dollar.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Biden Administration signed off on a new vaccine supply deal with Pfizer for $3.2 billion for 105 million COVID injections, but that\u2019s only for the first batch of mRNA shots. The contract will generate well over $9 billion for Pfizer, as this latest purchase agreement tops off at 300 million doses. Compared to previous settlements with Pfizer, this public-private no-bid arrangement will come at a much higher cost to the U.S. taxpayer.\n\nThe Biden Administration has justified the deal by claiming that it needs to restock supply to prepare for seasonal spikes. The data does not support such a claim. According to the CDC, almost 100 million taxpayer-funded Pfizer shots (and 169 million total shots) have gone unused, resulting in billions of dollars in waste.\n\nAccording to CDC data there are currently over 168 million unused doses of the vaccines.\n\n\u2013 59M unused Moderna shots\n\n\u2013 98M unused Pfizer shots\n\n\u2013 12M unused Janssen shots 762 million shots distributed and 594 shots administered. That 50,751 unused shots for every 100K US citizens pic.twitter.com/LFdN2RimoH \u2014 Justin Hart (@justin_hart) June 30, 2022\n\nThe new arrangement allows for the Biden Administration to buy Pfizer\u2019s authorization-pending COVID injections, which the company claims is reformulated for newer variants.\n\nHowever, even the new formulation is already outdated. It was designed and trialed for an Omicron subvariant (BA.1) that was popular last Winter, but no longer exists in circulation, potentially rendering it just as useless as the Wuhan strain shot. The deal includes the infant and toddler formulations, which are based on the non-existent Wuhan strain.\n\nNone of the shots for this deal will be supplied under an FDA approved label. Instead, they will be distributed under emergency use authorization (EUA). Pfizer has never deployed its FDA-approved vaccine in the United States. The company recently acknowledged that it never intends on producing its original FDA approved vaccines.\n\nThe original deal with Pfizer was negotiated by the Trump Administration during the days of Operation Warpspeed. It paid the pharma giant $19.50 a dose. The new pact gives Pfizer $30.48 per dose, resulting in an astronomical 56% hike from the deal negotiated by the last administration.\n\nThe price hike conflicts with the probability that Pfizer\u2019s costs are likely much lower than they were with the original purchase order. The infant and child shots have a fraction of the active agreement as the adult supply, and each vial stores more doses . Moreover, Pfizer has added an ingredient to the formula that allows for a significant shelf life extension, making the logistics much more cost effective.\n\nPfizer\u2019s margins were already through the roof prior to the Wednesday announcement.\n\nPfizer\u2019s May earnings report showed that the company logged a record breaking $26 billion in Q1 sales, marking a quarterly profit of $7.86 billion. Revenue was up 77% from 2021, while profit was up 61%. Now absorb these 2022 numbers in the context of Pfizer\u2019s 2021 revenue outperforming its 2020 revenue by 95%.\n\nBefore the new vaccine purchase order, Pfizer was already on track to bring in over $100 billion in revenue and $32 billion in net income this year. In financial statements, the company has acknowledged that it has transformed itself into a COVID-19-driven business. All of its new income is coming from the American taxpayer and other government \u201ccustomers\u201d via their taxpayers, who have virtually no say in the matter.\n\nRead the full article at The Dossier.\n\nSee Also:\n\nCOVID-19 \u201cVaccine\u201d Casualties List\n\nSee Also:",

        "Comments by Brian Shilhavy\n\nEditor, Health Impact News\n\nThe right of every American to question and criticize their government is enshrined in the Bill of Rights in the First Amendment. Prohibiting dissenting views on any government institution or practice is strictly unconstitutional.\n\nHowever, for the past few years many people have voiced concern about Big Tech platforms censoring dissenting views against the government, and the most common argument used by Big Tech is that they are simply a private platform that allows people to voice their views, and that the First Amendment does not apply to private corporations.\n\nBut now emails between the CDC and Google, Facebook, and Twitter have surfaced that suggest that the U.S. Government is, indeed, censoring dissenting views by influencing these Big Tech platforms, specifically in regards to the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nGiven how deadly these experimental vaccines have been, this is a very serious matter, and I would expect more lawsuits filed in the weeks and months ahead for what appears to be a gross violation of the First Amendment and the right of American citizens to criticize and question their government, especially in regards to medical and health issues.\n\nCDC Gave Big Tech Platforms Guidance On COVID Censorship\n\nZeroHedge News\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) gave censorship \u2018suggestions\u2019 to social media companies and Google in order to censor users who expressed skepticism or criticism of COVID-19 vaccines, according to the Washington Free Beacon, which obtained a trove of internal communications obtained by America First Legal.\n\nThe emails, between the CDC, Google, Twitter and Meta staffers \u2013 some of whom (as Just the News notes) were former Hill and White House aides \u2013 were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, and show extensive cooperation which included thinly veiled threats for failing to more aggressively remove content.\n\nOver the course of at least six months, starting in December 2020, CDC officials regularly communicated with personnel at Twitter, Facebook, and Google over \u201cvaccine misinformation.\u201d At various times, CDC officials would flag specific posts by users on social media platforms such as Twitter as \u201cexample posts.\u201d In one email to a CDC staffer, a Twitter employee said he is \u201clooking forward to setting up regular chats\u201d with the agency. Other emails show the scheduling of meetings with the CDC over how to best police alleged misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. -Free Beacon\n\nIn one April 2021 email between a CDC staffer and Facebook, concern was raised after \u201calgorithms that Facebook and other social media networks are apparently using to screen out posting by sources of vaccine misinformation are also apparently screening out valid public health messaging, including [Wyoming] Health communications.\u201d\n\nAnother email from March 2021 from a senior CDC staffer states: \u201cwe are working on [sic] project with Census to leverage their infrastructure to identify and monitor social media for vaccine misinformation.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, one email chain reveals that a CDC official showed up at Google\u2019s 2020 \u201cTrusted Media Summit\u201d conference, which was held for \u201cjournalists, fact-checkers, educators, researchers and others who work in the area of fact-checking, verification, media literacy, and otherwise fighting misinformation.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by an organizer if the senior CDC official would allow her remarks on YouTube, she declined, saying she was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nIn the same email chain with a senior CDC official, a Google staffer offers to promote an initiative from the World Health Organization about \u201caddressing the COVID-19 infodemic and strengthen community resilience against misinformation.\u201d That same Google staffer offers to introduce the CDC official to a Google colleague who is \u201cworking on programs to counter immunization misinfo.\u201d -Free Beacon\n\nMeanwhile, Facebook gave the CDC $15 million in ad credits to use on the company\u2019s platforms in April, 2021.\n\n\u201cThis gift will be used by CDC\u2019s COVID-19 response to support the agency\u2019s messages on Facebook, and extend the reach of COVID-19-related Facebook content, including messages on vaccines, social distancing, travel, and other priority communication messages,\u201d reads an internal memo.\n\nAs the Beacon notes, the level of coordination between government and big tech raises questions over what extent other private companies are working with the federal government in order to censor the public \u2013 including payment processors, Uber and other platforms which have banned the unwashed for wrongthink.\n\nThe revelations have also caused the New Civil Liberties Alliance to file a Thursday court document seeking to revive their lawsuit against the government on behalf of deplatformed users.\n\nNew Civil Liberties Alliance attorney Jenin Younes told Just the News it incorporated \u201cthe revelations about the CDC emails\u201d into a filing Thursday seeking to reopen its case against the feds on behalf of deplatformed users. A federal court dismissed that litigation a month before a whistleblower leaked documents suggesting the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s since-scrapped Disinformation Governance Board planned to \u201coperationalize\u201d its relationship with social media companies to remove content. NCLA cited those documents in its initial motion to reopen in June. -JTN\n\nJTN further notes that the document dump is also likely to come into play in a lawsuit by Missouri and Louisiana AGs against the government for alleged collusion with Big Tech to censor content on the origins of COVID-19, as well as Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop and vote-by-mail election integrity.\n\nRecall that just one day after top health officials had a conference call to discuss a Zero Hedge article which highlighted a now-withdrawn paper from researchers in India suggesting \u201cHIV-like insertions\u201d in COVID-19, Twitter banned our account for roughly two months \u2013 with the tech giant claiming we doxxed a Chinese scientist (with publicly available information) in another article.\n\nThanks to a recent Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for Fauci\u2019s emails, we know that the National Institutes of Health was not only aware of the Indian report, but were actively discussing how to handle it.\n\nA January 31, 2020 email from AFP\u2019s Issam Ahmed asks NIH immunologist Dr. Barney Graham for comment:\n\n\u201cI was told by a contact you may be willing to give an opinion of this paper that has just gone live. It suggests the new Coronavirus has four inserts similar to HIV-1 and this is not a coincidence,\u201d reads the email.\n\nGraham immediately forwards the correspondence to the Office of Communications and Government Relations (OCGR), saying \u201cThis is one we don\u2019t want to answer without high-level input, but wanted you to know about the rising controversy.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, Jennifer Routh OCGR replies, telling Graham: \u201cOCGR is going to send a note to the reporter to decline, noting that the paper is not peer-reviewed. Please let us know if you receive similar requests.\u201d\n\nThat same Sunday morning, Fauci is looped in \u2013 with Sir Jeremy Farrar forwarding Zero Hedge\u2018s article after mentioning how World Health Organization Director Tedros Adhanom and the organization\u2019s cabinet chief were in \u2018conclave\u2019 \u2013 ostensibly on how to manage the narrative \u2013 noting \u201cIf they do prevaricate [bullshit the public], I would appreciate a call with you later tonight or tomorrow to think how we might take forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have a minute for a quick call?\u201d Fauci replies, after having called the Indian paper \u201creally outlandish.\u201d\n\nOf course, the Indian paper was quickly withdrawn by its authors, and the notion that COVID-19 could have been man-made was rendered radioactive \u2013 for a while.\n\nIs it any question how our Twitter (and Google) deplatformings happened, before both companies chose to reverse their decisions?\n\nRead the full article at ZeroHedge News.\n\nSee Also:",

At any other point in history, we might be in another major war and we would be the criminal aggressor. That means every action we take today is critical to put this regime out of its misery, and secure a future for our nation and mankind.\n\nUnderlying the current globalist meltdown is a little known question of economic metrics, that is, how do we measure real success.

        "In a stunning development, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last week admitted \u2014 despite assurances to the contrary \u2014 the agency never analyzed the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for safety signals for COVID-19 vaccines.The admission was revealed in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request submitted by Children's Health Defense (CHD).In September 2021, I published an article in The Defender in which I used the CDC's published methodology to analyze VAERS for safety signals from COVID-19 vaccines.The signals were loud and clear, leading me to wonder \"why is nobody listening?\"After that article was published, I urged CHD's legal team to submit a FOIA request to the CDC about its VAERS monitoring activities.Since CDC officials stated publicly that \" COVID-19 vaccine safety monitoring is the most robust in U.S. history,\" I had assumed that at the very least, CDC officials were monitoring VAERS using the methods they described in a briefing document posted on the CDC website in January 2021 (and updated in February 2022, with minor changes).I was wrong.This is a method of comparing the proportion of different types of adverse events reported for a new vaccine to the proportion of those events reported for an older, established vaccine.If the new vaccine shows a significantly higher reporting rate of a particular adverse event relative to the old one, it counts as a safety signal that should then trigger a more thorough investigation.The agency suggested contacting the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) , which was supposed to perform a different type of data mining, according to the briefing document.CDC officials repeatedly claimed they have not seen safety signals in VAERS.For example, on April 27, 2021, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky stated the CDC did not see any signals related to heart inflammation The table is dated April 2, 2021, almost four weeks before she made those remarks.In fact, among the 15 adverse events for adults included in that week's tabulations, PRRs I calculated also show loud-and-clear safety signals for acute myocardial infarction, anaphylaxis, appendicitis, Bell's palsy, coagulopathy, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A), stroke and death.The actual monitoring the CDC did diverges from the one promised in the briefing document in other ways.For example, the CDC never created tables of the top 25 adverse events reported in the previous week, tables comparing different vaccine manufacturers, or tables of auto-immune diseases.And it only began monitoring in early April 2021, even though reports from COVID-19 vaccines had been flooding VAERS since mid-December of the previous year.To be clear, VAERS is not the only database the CDC uses to monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety.For example, the CDC sponsored several studies of COVID-19 safety using the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), which is comprised of millions of medical records from HMO's across several states.Those studies do not raise many safety concerns. However, they make many questionable methodological choices.To give one example, a major safety study based on VSD data published in September 2021, in \"JAMA,\" compares adverse event rates that occur within 1-21 days of vaccination to the rate of occurrence from 22 to 42 days after vaccination.It makes no comparison between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, or before vaccination versus after in the same individuals.Moreover, the VSD is far from infallible, having failed initially to detect the increase in myocarditis rates It simply beggars belief that the CDC failed to do this simple calculation. Even now, a paper published by CDC staff in March on the safety of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines remains purely descriptive with no PRR calculation.Meanwhile, a study published by a researcher not affiliated with the CDC in February in \"Frontiers in Public Health\" analyzes VAERS and EudraVigilance data using a method similar to PRRs, revealing clear and concerning safety signals.And while it is true that VAERS is not the only database the CDC can use to monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety, it is of critical importance because it can reveal signals much faster than any other method \u2014 if anybody cares to look for them.But even if it was, it doesn't change the fact that the CDC completely failed in its promise to monitor VAERS for safety signals.",

        "by Fabio Giuseppe Carlo Carisio\n\nVERSIONE IN ITALIANO\n\nA disturbing document had already emerged proving the existence of an experimental gene serum based on messenger RNA against Covid-19 on 12 December 2019.\n\nBut nothing appears compared to the terrible secrets about the Spikevax vaccine produced by Big Pharma Moderna in Cambridge (Massachusetts, USA) thanks to the money of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Pentagon (the American Department of Defense), and the collaboration with the Niaid (Institute Allergy and Infectious Diseases National Park) headed by Anthony Fauci, White House advisor on the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic.\n\nPatent US10702600 for the vaccine candidate mRNA-1273 was in fact registered in its new composition on March 28, 2019.\n\nThat is 9 months before the official outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in China and the availability of the official Wuhan sequence MN908947.1, the virus initially called 2019-nCoV and then renamed by the World Health Organization SARS-Cov-2 to the strong genomic identity with SARS of 2003 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, when virus and disease were called the same).\n\nThis revelation comes from \u201cThe Fauci / COVID-19 Dossier\u201d prepared by the American doctor David E. Martin who has developed a colossal study on US government-funded patents in relation to Coronaviruses since 2000, so much so that he suspects that SARS too in 2003 was built in the laboratory by microbiologist Ralph Baric of the Chapel Hill research center of the University of North Carolina (UNC) under the aegis of Fauci himself.\n\nAs we will see after long but inevitable premises, the registration of Moderna\u2019s experimental vaccine on March 28, 2019, is also confirmed by the official history stored in the patent \u2026\n\nThe discovery becomes even more disturbing in light of the fact that such research was conducted by the pharmaceutical company at the same time as Baric\u2019s extremely dangerous experiments on SARS recombinant viruses conducted together with the director of the Infectious Diseases Research Center of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Shi Zhengli, not randomly dubbed in China \u201cBatWoman\u201d for its coronavirus tests of horseshoe bats.\n\nAs anticipated before the online investigation in the book WuhanGates (December 2020), they would be the godfathers and progenitors of a huge plot of the New World Order of ancient British Masonic origin hatched under the sign of the Chinese Communists and American Democrats.\n\nTo it was also added the peremptory paws of Italy and Saudi Arabia aimed at global immunization projects preparatory to the health dictatorship of the Covid-19 emergency and the promotion of experimental anti-Covid gene serums for the enrichment of Big Pharma and speculation of the same investment funds that control the Weapons Lobby.\n\nTHE THERAPY OF DONNO AFFECTED BY THE MODERN GROUP\n\nBefore briefly summarizing the many information contained in the WuhanGates 40 report on the research of Professor Baric and Doctor Fauci, coordinator of all the riskiest and secret experiments on viruses and bacteriological weapons in the 28 American civil and military laboratories as evidenced by the exclusive investigation by Gospa News, we recall another of the mysteries in the ambiguous fight against Covid-19 revealed only by our online newspaper.\n\nModerna is part of that colossal international Zacks group that became interested in the highly effective therapy against Covid-19 of hyperimmune plasma developed by Professor Giuseppe De Donno and mysteriously vanished in the maze of health policy before his mysterious suicide.\n\nIt should also be remembered that the experimental gene sera were able to obtain emergency authorization in the USA, from the Food and Drug Administration which, however, in recent weeks gave definitive ok to Spikevax after having granted it to Comirnaty of Pizer-Biontech amid a thousand controversies for not having subjected the clinical data to the scrutiny of the independent Advisory Committee, and in the European Union by the European Medicines Agency (where they remain with a conditional marketing authorization as still experimental) only by virtue of two factors.\n\nThe pandemic has resulted in millions of deaths in the world with Covid-19 (in the minority died from Covid-19 and the majority from complications of other diseases), in Italy and in other countries mainly due to inadequate home and hospital care such as betrayal. use of cortisone or the disputed hydroxychloroquine (adopted by the protocols of the Piedmont Region) and the absence of drugs recognized as effective.\n\nTherefore, the stop of the De Donno therapy, successfully carried out in over one hundred American university hospitals as recalled by the Johns Hopkins University in its defense, represented one of the obstacles in alternative treatments functional to the promotion of Moderna and other Big Pharma\u2019s anti-Covid vaccines.\n\nEXPERIMENTS ON CHIMERIC VIRUSES BEFORE 2003\n\n\u00abThe National Institute of Health\u2019s grant AI23946-08 issued to Dr. Ralph Baric at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (officially classified as affiliated with Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2019s NIAID by at least 2003) began the work on synthetically altering the Coronaviridae (the coronavirus family) for the express purpose of general research, pathogenic enhancement, detection, manipulation, and potential therapeutic interventions targeting the same. As early as May 21, 2000, Dr. Baric and UNC sought to patent critical sections of the coronavirus family for their commercial benefit\u00bb.\n\nAs Martin\u2019s dossier reports, in one of several articles derived from the work sponsored by this grant, \u00abBaric published what he reported to be the SARS CoV full-length cDNA in which it was clearly stated that SAR CoV was based on a compound. of DNA segments\u00bb.\n\nHaines, subsequently, not only 2018 prophesied a coronavirus epidemic that could only be faced with a new \u201cWorld Order\u201d but will be one of the main protagonists of the Event 201 exercise held in mid-October in New York thanks to funding from the World Economic Forum by Klaus Schwab (Great Reset) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nOn the recommendation of American President Joseph Biden (her longtime political friend) on 21 January 2021 she was appointed by the Senate National Director of Intelligence from where she coordinates all 17 military and civil intelligence agencies and from where she searched, without success. for a rift between 007, to refute the thesis of the artificial origin of SARS-Cov-2.\n\nMODERN STUDIES IN THE SAME YEARS\n\n\u00abBy March 2015, both the virulence of the S1 spike protein and the ACE II receptor was known to present a considerable risk to human health. NIAID, EcoHealth Alliance, and numerous researchers lamented the fact that the public was not sufficiently concerned about coronavirus to adequately fund their desired research\u00bb the dossier still reads in reference to the experiments conducted in a \u201cChina-US affair\u201d as Montagnier claimed on the origin of laboratory SARS-Cov-2.\n\nIn 2013, the Autonomous Diagnostics to Enable Prevention and Therapeutics (ADEPT) program awarded grant funding to Moderna Therapeutics for the development of a new type of vaccine based on messenger RNA. The initial DARPA grant was W911NF-13-1-0417\u00bb reveals Dr. Martin.\n\nIn 2015 Moderna signed an agreement for the development of vaccines with NIAID and executes it with the head of the developer and main inventor mRNA-1273 Giuseppe Ciaramella, says Dr. Martin referring to the \u201cprototype\u201d of the experimental antiCovid gene serum named in 2020 Spikevax.\n\nON 2016 NIH through Scripps Institute and Dartmouth College file patent application WO 2018081318A1 \u201cPrefusion Coronavirus Spike Proteins and their Use\u201d disclosing mRNA technology that overlaps (and is used in tandem with) Moderna\u2019s technology. Lead Inventor Barney Scott Graham was well known to Moderna as he\u2019s the person at NIH that Moderna \u201ce-mailed\u201d to get the sequence for SARS CoV-2 according to Moderna\u2019s report. In addition, co-inventor Jason McLellan worked with Graham on a vaccine patent jointly owned by the Chinese government filed in Australia in 2013,\n\nmRNA-1273 \u2013 the experimental vaccine developed by Moderna for COVID-19 \u2013 uses the LNP technology that Moderna thought it had licensed from Acuitas Therapeutics Inc., a firm developed by a former principal of Arbutus\u2019 prior company Tekmira. That license did not authorize Moderna to use the technology for the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nM \u00b7 CAM and Knowledge Ecology International (Martin\u2019s reference bodies \u2013 ed) have independently confirmed that Moderna has violated U.S. law in failing to disclose the U.S. government\u2019s funding interest in their patents and patent applications\u00bb reads in The Fauci / Covid-19 Dossier.\n\nWhile this negligence impacts all of Moderna\u2019s over 130 granted U.S. patents, it is particularly problematic for U.S. Patent 10,702,600 (\u2018600) which is the patent relating to, \u201ca messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) comprising an open reading frame encoding a beta coronavirus (BetaCoV) S protein or S protein subunit formulated in a lipid nanoparticle\u00bb.\n\nWe have dedicated a long investigation to the mysterious and dangerous biotechnologies with lipid nanoparticles with extensive scientific documentation in relation to the Comirnaty messenger RNA gene serum (\u201cheterozygous twin\u201d of Spikevax), produced by the New Yorker Pfizer with the German Biotech: the first partner of the London-based GSK run by a Microsoft director, the second funded by the same IT tycoon Gates.\n\nTHE VACCINE WAS PATENTED 9 MONTHS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC\n\nIn addition to the patents cited by the USPTO in their examination of \u2018600, M\u00b7CAM has identified fourteen other issued patents preceding the \u2018600 patent which were used by patent examiners to limit patents arising from the same funded research including patents sought by CureVac.\n\n\u00abIn short, while Moderna enjoys hundreds of millions of dollars of funding allegiance and advocacy from Anthony Fauci and his NIAID, since its inception, it has been engaged in the illegal patent activity and demonstrated contempt for U.S. Patent law. To make matters worse, the U.S. Government has given it financial backing in the face of undisclosed infringement risks potentially contributing to the very infringement for which they are indemnified\u00bb concludes the medical author of The Fauci / Covid-19 Dossier.\n\nBut now comes the explosive statement: \u00abThe specific claims addressing the pivot to the SARS Coronavirus were patented on March 28, 2019 \u2013 9 months before the SARS CoV-2 outbreak! Both the patent and the DARPA funding for the technology were disclosed in a scientific publications (New England Journal of Medicine) but the government funds were not acknowledged in the patent\u00bb is Dr. Martin\u2019s shocking revelation.\n\nThe patent is updated on 7 July 2020 but was registered for the first time on 28 February 2020 but in continuation of the previous registration of 28 March 2019: the only one not to have changed the patent number (Pat. No.) as is seen in the historical extract of the vaccine.\n\n\u201cContinuation of aplication No. 16 / 368,270, filed on Mar.28,2019, which is a continuation of aplication No. 16 / 040,981, filed on Jul.20,2018, now Pat.No. 10,272,150, which is a continuation of aplication No. 15 / 674,599, filed on Aug.1,2017, now Pat.No.10,064,934, which is a continuation of aplication No.PCT / US2016 / 058327, filed on Oct.21,2016 \u201c.\n\nTHE EXCHANGE OF DOCUMENTS IN DECEMBER 2019\n\nAnalogs were suspected of the existence of an experimental gene serum from Moderna before the official discovery of the Wuhan-Hu-1 virus, later identified as a new coronavirus initially named 2019-nCoV because the first cases were recorded in the populated city of Hubei precisely in that year, which was isolated and sequenced as Wuhan MN908947.1 on January 5, 2020.\n\nThe first to report the macroscopic anomaly was the British online investigative newspaper The Daily Expos\u00e9: \u00abThe first to report the macroscopic anomaly was the British online investigative newspaper The Daily Expos\u00e9. \u201cA confidentiality agreement shows that potential coronavirus vaccine candidates were transferred from Moderna to the University of North Carolina in 2019, nineteen days before the emergence of the alleged virus causing Covid-19 in Wuhan, China wrote the British media on June 18, 2021.\n\nThe confidential agreement (like at the bottom of the page) states that providers \u2018Moderna\u2019 alongside the \u2018National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) agreed to transfer \u2018mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates\u2019 developed and jointly-owned by NIAID and Moderna to recipients \u2018The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\u2019 on the 12th December 2019 wrote the editorial staff of Expos\u00e9 publishing the extracts on pages 105 and 108.\n\nThe material transfer agreement was signed the December 12th, 2019 by Ralph Baric, Ph.D., at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (the microbiologist of the laboratory chimeric SARS virus experiments \u2013 ed), and then signed by Jacqueline Quay, Director of Licensing and Innovation Support at the University of North Carolina on December 16th, 2019\u00bb adds the online newspaper, then asking inevitable questions\u2026\n\nPANDEMIC EMERGENCY, WAR IN UKRAINE, AND APOCALYPSE\n\nSo why was an mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidate developed by Moderna being transferred to the University of North Carolina on December 12th, 2019? Perhaps Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases would like to explain themselves in a court of law?.\n\nQuestions similar to those I asked myself in an interview with TG6 journalist Anna Turletti in which I asked myself: \u201cWhen will Bill Gates, the great director of dangerous research on laboratory SARS viruses in Wuhan and financier of Big Pharma, be arrested for the consequent vaccines? Is there only one magistrate on earth, only one, willing to do so in the face of this serious, precise, and consistent evidence of a diabolical plan?\u201d.\n\nThis pandemic has been \u201cplanned for decades by Fauci and Gates\u201d, also according to the lawyer Robert F. Kennedy jr, engaged through his association Children\u2019s Health Defense in the fight against vaccines without adequate testing also inoculated to minors, as shamelessly admitted by the Pfizer itself in relation to the lack of data on myocardial risks for children under the age of 5.\n\nBut the manipulation of the viral load in the toxic protein Spike, as revealed by Colonel Lawrence Sellin, a former researcher in the bacteriological laboratories of the US Army of Fort Detrick Frederick (Maryland), could be the cause of similar toxicity of vaccines suitable to explain the reactions. serious or even fatal adverse events.\n\nThis pandemic was also functional to the world health dictatorship and therefore strategically preparatory to the Dictatorship of the New World Order and the imposition of the economic Great Reset, concretely feasible only through a real famine in the rich West and a Third World War such as the one that could derive from the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nCertainly the last Great War on planet earth: before the Apocalypse!\n\nFabio Giuseppe Carlo Carisio\n\n\u00a9 COPYRIGHT GOSPA NEWS\n\nprohibition of reproduction without authorization\n\nfollow Gospa News on Telegram\n\n.",

Despite having the largest military in the world, tenfold, the US came in 35th behind nations like Iran, Finland and Slovenia. No video or photos exist of the US team, no records were kept, a huge team but a pitiful performance for the best military in the world.\n\nThe US team did so badly that they were called \u201cSoy Sauce Soldiers\u201d by the Chinese. In fact, many never participated in any event and stayed near the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where the disease is said to have originated only days after the US left the area.\n\n\u201cYou look at how the US team performed in the 2019 Military Games, and you think about the overall economic situation in America, and you wonder how long the US can continue on its current path when the economies debt is at an unprecedented rate\u201d, stated Ben Tejes, Co-Founder and CEO of Ascend Finance, which created a Chapter 7 means test calculator to help people understand their debt relief options such as bankruptcy.\n\nThe US team went home on October 28, 2019, and within 2 weeks, the first human contact cases of COVID 19 were seen in Wuhan. The Chinese have not been able to find \u201cpatient zero\u201d and believe he was a member of the US team.\n\nThey also have sources that say the US had misrepresented influenza that Trump claims have killed thousands, influenza carried to China by the US team, influenza that was really COVID 19, a disease developed in a military bio-warfare facility in the state of Washington, now \u201cground zero\u201d in the US for COVID 19.\n\nThe Chinese claim, something censored in the US, that the inattentive attitude and disproportionately below average results of American athletes in the game indicates they might have been in for other purposes and they might actually be bio-warfare operatives, and that their place of residence during their stay in Wuhan was also close to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where the first known cluster of cases occurred.[28][29]\n\nRT/Moscow: The US army might have brought the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to China\u2019s Wuhan, the city where the virus was first detected in the country, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWhen did patient zero begin in the US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be the US army that brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! The US owes us an explanation!\u201d Zhao tweeted.\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lijian Zhao has demanded US authorities reveal what they\u2019re hiding about the origins of Covid-19, going as far as to suggest the coronavirus may have been brought to China by the US military.\n\nPointing to a video of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Robert Redfield apparently admitting the US had several deaths from Covid-19 before they were able to test for it, Zhao called on the American watchdog to come clean in a tweet posted on Thursday.\n\n2/2 CDC was caught on the spot.

He did not elaborate on when these misdiagnosed cases first appeared \u2013 saying only that \u201csome cases have been diagnosed that way.\u201d\n\nCDC director openly admitting that some #covid deaths have been misdiagnosed as influenza in the US.

Zhao\u2019s \u201ctheory\u201d in particular focused on the military delegation that traveled to Wuhan in October for the Military World Games, weeks before the city confirmed the outbreak in December. The delegation was part of the 300-member group of American athletes taking part in the multi-sport event held every four years.\n\nThe #Bahrain Interior Minister accused Iran of spreading #COVID19 & biological warfare.

Former Malaysian PM Matthias Chang offered similar speculation back in January, zeroing in on the event as the launch point for what he deemed a biological war waged by the US against China.\n\nWe are still figuring out where the virus originated. And chances are high that the virus was brought to China by the US army team who visited Wuhan in October. Anyway, no human deserves COVID-19. The world should fight against the disease together. No time for blame. \u2014 Chris Jiang (@crs_1222) February 27, 2020\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) states that what is now the Covid-19 pandemic was first reported as a coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China, on 31 December 2019. The search for the deadly disease\u2019s origin has been ongoing, with conflicting versions blaming the Wuhan food market and bats \u2013 a local delicacy \u2013 sold there in particular, while others opined humans might have gotten the virus from pangolins, an endangered scaly mammal.\n\nLess orthodox theories suggest malicious intent, with the head of Iran\u2019s elite Revolutionary Guards sensationally claiming last week that Covid-19 could possibly be \u201ca product of a biological attack by America which initially spread to China and then to Iran and the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nSo far, the problem with all of those theories, blaming both animals and humans, is that no direct causal proof has been established, while the identity of China\u2019s \u201cpatient zero\u201d also remains unclear. And it\u2019s not China alone: in Washington state \u2013 which seemingly identified and successfully isolated its first infected traveler, with dozens of contacts identified and monitored \u2013 the virus somehow began spreading anyway. Even Steve Wozniak, Apple\u2019s co-founder, at one point claimed he and his wife may have been the US\u2019 \u201cpatient zero\u201d after developing a bad cough on return from China. It has since emerged his wife\u2019s diagnosis was \u201ca sinus infection,\u201d however.\n\nWhy does the plague in Wuhan depend on the PLA?\n\n2020-01-30 17:01:10 Source: school coffee house Author: fish off the deep\n\nViews: 37708 Comments: 24 (view) From October 18 to October 27, 2019, the World Military Games was held in Wuhan, and the United States sent 369 soy sauce soldiers to participate. Why is it soy sauce soldiers? Because in the 10-day game, the performance of the American soy sauce soldiers was so disappointing that even Bahrain was unnecessarily disappointed, the gold medal was even missing, and the overall score was left far behind by North Korea, which once gave Mexico a chance. The urge to counterattack the continental United States. However, the poor performance in the game did not affect the mood of the soy sauce soldiers playing in Wuhan. They teamed up in groups of two, and played around the streets of Wuhan, leaving many romantic accidents. It should be pointed out that the location of the US guest house of the Military Games is not far from South China Seafood City. At the end of the military games, just when people were wondering, how could these gangsters who can\u2019t wait to build muscles on their faces suddenly get fired up? Did the American soldiers \u2019food only be grappled? Or did they forget to eat it during the game?

        "By Olivia Cavallaro\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is supposed to be the United States\u2019 primary voice of scientific reason in the face of the global pandemic, but a recent revelation reveals that the data it presents to people, particularly when it comes to vaccine-related casualties, is at best questionable.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s constant changing of rules and guidelines surrounding COVID has made some weary and doubtful of its authority. This is also in part due to the fact that while the CDC meticulously tracks who has and has not received a COVID vaccine in the U.S., it has failed to shed light on those who suffered major side effects from the experimental vaccines or even passed away from it.\n\nThere has been a huge lack of push for investigation and study on those who have passed away after they received a COVID vaccine. But citizens can keep track through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a database co-managed by the CDC and FDA.\n\nThe VAERS\u2019 role is to \u201c[accept] and [analyze] reports of adverse events (possible side effects) after a person has received a vaccination.\u201d It is a \u201cpassive reporting system\u201d that \u201crelies on individuals to send in reports of their experiences to CDC and FDA.\u201d\n\nHerein lies the problem: the VAERS database showed on Friday that there had been 11,140 reported deaths from the COVID vaccine in the United States alone, the Gateway Pundit reported. This figure shows a slight increase from the 9,125 reported deaths reported last week.\n\nOn Wednesday, the CDC updated its website to indicate that \u201cin the United States from December 14, 2020, through July 19, 2021, \u2026VAERS received 6,207 reports of death (0.0018%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d\n\nOn July 19, Monday, however, the very same website, showed that \u201cVAERS received 12,313 reports of death (0.0036%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d This is a staggering 6,000 post-vaccination deaths. This update can be seen at the Internet Archive.\n\nThe numbers were again changed later within the same day, with the number of deaths down to 6,079 again. It\u2019s worth noting that the dates were also changed to only cover post-vaccination deaths between Dec. 14, 2020 and July 13, 2021.\n\nIf the data that was changed is accurate, it could mean that 6,000 vaccinated people died between July 13 and 19, which is a period of but six days.\n\nA video explaining the strange incident can be seen via Infowars. It can also be accessed here.\n\nInfowars reported that a whistleblower recently filed a lawsuit saying that VAERS underreports vaccine-related deaths by a factor of at least five, which means that the real number of COVID vaccine deaths should be at about 45,000.\n\nThe question of vaccine safety and efficacy is important now more than ever with the back to school season in the horizon and with the FDA considering extending vaccine eligibility to children.\n\nBut the Wall Street Journal has some reservations about having kids vaccinated against COVID, claiming that government policies are impacting children based on one statistic: the number of children under 18 who have died with a COVID diagnosis code in their record. That statistic is 335. The report questioned why the CDC has failed to \u201c[research] each death to find out whether COVID caused it or if it involved a pre-existing medical condition.\u201d\n\nInstead, the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices went ahead in May to decide that the two doses of COVID vaccine \u201coutweigh the risks for all kids 12 to 15.\u201d\n\nMarty Makary wrote for the WSJ, \u201cI\u2019ve written hundreds of peer-reviewed medical studies, and I can think of no journal editor who would accept the claim that 335 deaths resulted from a virus without data to indicate if the virus was incidental or causal, and without an analysis of relevant risk factors such as obesity.\u201d"

Their name was included for that reason only.\n\nCOVID 19 was a US Army bio-weapons project to manufacture a pneumonia-causing disease that would be nearly impossible to vaccinate for in patients over 40 years old.\n\nThe proof is here, simply scroll down. The study was run by the University of North Carolina and funded by USAID/CIA. It chose a Chinese bat virus and chose to include a medical facility in Wuhan as well.\n\nNow we know why, a smokescreen of the blame for a program China had little or nothing to do with, something satanically evil and purely American.\n\nIn November 2015, a study was published outlining the capability of producing the virus we are dealing with now. Among the many involved was a lab in Wuhan, China. It was listed from the beginning as one of the dozens, mostly American, working on this project.\n\nHowever, one key participant was left out, USAID. It is suspected, deeply so, that USAID is a front for American bio-warfare research such as that done in Tbilisi, Georgia, and elsewhere, much documented. This is the citation that adds USAID to the research funding group.\n\nChange history\n\n20 November 2015\n\nIn the version of this article initially published online, the authors omitted to acknowledge a funding source, USAID-EPT-PREDICT funding from EcoHealth Alliance, to Z.-L.S.

Then the authors claimed that after the advent of the SARS virus (2002-2003) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), scientists were aware of the risk of interspecific transmission that would lead to an epidemic among people.\n\nSuccessful lab experiment\n\nAmong other things, the research team studied bats, which are the largest incubators of coronaviruses. Nevertheless, bats could not transmit the coronavirus to humans because they could not interact with human cells with ACE2 receptors.\n\nThe material also stated that horseshoe bats carry a strain of SARS coronavirus that can be transmitted to humans. It has been named the SHC014-CoV virus.\n\nTo better study this virus, scientists copied the coronavirus and infected it with laboratory mice. The results showed that the virus is really able to bind to human cells with ACE2 receptors and multiply in the cells of the respiratory system.\n\nIn the research work, it is noted that laboratory materials, samples and equipment that were used in the research were obtained from the Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. Although it is not yet possible to say for sure that the virus that was tested in laboratory mice is the same as the SARS-Cove-2 coronavirus.\n\nNATO policy\n\nHowever, interesting things can be found in earlier documents.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe 2019 Alliance\u2019s activity report says that in 2019, the Alliance\u2019s first place in research and development was occupied by the topic of radiochemical and biological protection (29%), shifting the seemingly most pressing problem of Europe \u2013 counterterrorism (it turned out to be 4- m priority).\n\nA year earlier, in 2018, the situation was exactly the opposite: terrorism, as it should be, was in the first place (28%), and radiochemical and biological protection in the fourth (13%).\n\nAs the Brussels snitch writes in the telegram channel, \u201cgiven the absence of visible reasons for such a sharp change in scientific interests, there are two options and both are unpleasant:\n\nor NATO now wags the fifth point, falsifying the data to show \u201cand we always prepared for viruses, we are modern\u201d,\n\nor even in 2019 in the alliance, God forgive me, they knew where the trouble would come from.\n\nYes, the first option is much more real, but, you see, the facts are surprising.\n\nSource: Pravda\n\nOriginal 2015 Research Unedited and Complete\n\nPublished: 09 November 2015 A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence by Vineet D Menachery, Boyd L Yount Jr, Kari Debbink, Sudhakar Agnihothram, Lisa E Gralinski, Jessica A Plante, Rachel L Graham, Trevor Scobey, Xing-Yi Ge, Eric F Donaldson, Scott H Randell, Antonio Lanzavecchia, Wayne A Marasco, Zhengli-Li Shi, Ralph S Baric\n\nNature Medicine volume 21, pages 1508\u20131513 (2015)\n\nA Corrigendum to this article was published on 06 April 2016\n\nThis article has been updated\n\nAbstract\n\nThe emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV underscores the threat of cross-species transmission events leading to outbreaks in humans. Here we examine the disease potential of a SARS-like virus, SHC014-CoV, which is currently circulating in Chinese horseshoe bat populations1. Using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system2, we generated and characterized a chimeric virus expressing the spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone.\n\nThe results indicate that group 2b viruses encoding the SHC014 spike in a wild-type backbone can efficiently use multiple orthologs of the SARS receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells and achieve in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis.\n\nEvaluation of available SARS-based immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy; both monoclonal antibody and vaccine approach failed to neutralize and protect from infection with CoVs using the novel spike protein.\n\nOn the basis of these findings, we synthetically re-derived an infectious full-length SHC014 recombinant virus and demonstrate robust viral replication both in vitro and in vivo. Our work suggests a potential risk of SARS-CoV re-emergence from viruses currently circulating in bat populations.\n\nMain\n\nThe emergence of SARS-CoV heralded a new era in the cross-species transmission of severe respiratory illness with globalization leading to rapid spread around the world and massive economic impact3,4. Since then, several strains\u2014including influenza A strains H5N1, H1N1 and H7N9, and MERS-CoV\u2014have emerged from animal populations, causing considerable disease, mortality and economic hardship for the afflicted regions5. Although public health measures were able to stop the SARS-CoV outbreak4, recent metagenomics studies have identified sequences of closely related SARS-like viruses circulating in Chinese bat populations that may pose a future threat1,6.\n\nHowever, sequence data alone provides minimal insights to identify and prepare for future pre-pandemic viruses. Therefore, to examine the emergence potential (that is, the potential to infect humans) of circulating bat CoVs, we built a chimeric virus encoding a novel, zoonotic CoV spike protein\u2014from the RsSHC014-CoV sequence that was isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats1\u2014in the context of the SARS-CoV mouse-adapted backbone. The hybrid virus allowed us to evaluate the ability of the novel spike protein to cause disease independently of other necessary adaptive mutations in its natural backbone.\n\nUsing this approach, we characterized CoV infection mediated by the SHC014 spike protein in primary human airway cells and in vivo and tested the efficacy of available immune therapeutics against SHC014-CoV. Together, the strategy translates metagenomics data to help predict and prepare for future emergent viruses.\n\nThe sequences of SHC014 and the related RsWIV1-CoV show that these CoVs are the closest relatives to the epidemic SARS-CoV strains (Fig. 1a,b); however, there are important differences in the 14 residues that bind human ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV, including the five that are critical for host range: Y442, L472, N479, T487 and Y491 (ref. 7).\n\nIn WIV1, three of these residues vary from the epidemic SARS-CoV Urbani strain, but they were not expected to alter binding to ACE2 (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 1). This fact is confirmed by both pseudotyping experiments that measured the ability of lentiviruses encoding WIV1 spike proteins to enter cells expressing human ACE2 (Supplementary Fig. 1) and by in vitro replication assays of WIV1-CoV (ref. 1). In contrast, 7 of 14 ACE2-interaction residues in SHC014 are different from those in SARS-CoV, including all five residues critical for the host range (Supplementary Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 1).\n\nThese changes, coupled with the failure of pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing the SHC014 spike to enter cells (Supplementary Fig. 1d), suggested that the SHC014 spike is unable to bind human ACE2. However, similar changes in related SARS-CoV strains had been reported to allow ACE2 binding7,8, suggesting that additional functional testing was required for verification.\n\nTherefore, we synthesized the SHC014 spike in the context of the replication-competent, mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone (we hereafter refer to the chimeric CoV as SHC014-MA15) to maximize the opportunity for pathogenesis and vaccine studies in mice (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Despite predictions from both structure-based modeling and pseudotyping experiments, SHC014-MA15 was viable and replicated to high titers in Vero cells (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Similar to SARS, SHC014-MA15 also required a functional ACE2 molecule for entry and could use human, civet and bat ACE2 orthologs (Supplementary Fig. 2c,d).\n\nTo test the ability of the SHC014 spike to mediate infection of the human airway, we examined the sensitivity of the human epithelial airway cell line Calu-3 2B4 (ref. 9) to infection and found robust SHC014-MA15 replication, comparable to that of SARS-CoV Urbani (Fig. 1c).\n\nTo extend these findings, primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures were infected and showed robust replication of both viruses (Fig. 1d). Together, the data confirm the ability of viruses with the SHC014 spike to infect human airway cells and underscore the potential threat of cross-species transmission of SHC014-CoV.\n\nFigure 1: SARS-like viruses replicate in human airway cells and produce in vivo pathogenesis.\n\n(a) The full-length genome sequences of representative CoVs were aligned and phylogenetically mapped as described in the Online Methods. The scale bar represents nucleotide substitutions, with only bootstrap support above 70% being labeled. The tree shows CoVs divided into three distinct phylogenetic groups, defined as \u03b1-CoVs, \u03b2-CoVs and \u03b3-CoVs. Classical subgroup clusters are marked as 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d for the \u03b2-CoVs and as 1a and 1b for the \u03b1-CoVs. (b) Amino acid sequences of the S1 domains of the spikes of representative \u03b2-CoVs of the 2b group, including SARS-CoV, were aligned and phylogenetically mapped. The scale bar represents the amino acid substitutions.

Samples were collected at individual time points with biological replicates (n = 3) for both Calu-3 and HAE experiments.

Scale bars, 1 mm.\n\nFull size image\n\nTo evaluate the role of the SHC014 spike in mediating infection in vivo, we infected 10-week-old BALB/c mice with 104 plaque-forming units (p.f.u.) of either SARS-MA15 or SHC014-MA15 (Fig. 1e\u2013h). Animals infected with SARS-MA15 experienced rapid weight loss and lethality by 4 d post-infection (d.p.i.); in contrast, SHC014-MA15 infection produced substantial weight loss (10%) but no lethality in mice (Fig. 1e). Examination of viral replication revealed nearly equivalent viral titers from the lungs of mice infected with SARS-MA15 or SHC014-MA15 (Fig. 1f). Whereas lungs from the SARS-MA15\u2013infected mice showed robust staining in both the terminal bronchioles and the lung parenchyma 2 d.p.i. (Fig. 1g), those of SHC014-MA15\u2013infected mice showed reduced airway antigen staining (Fig. 1h); in contrast, no deficit in antigen staining was observed in the parenchyma or in the overall histology scoring, suggesting differential infection of lung tissue for SHC014-MA15 (Supplementary Table 2).\n\nWe next analyzed infection in more susceptible, aged (12-month-old) animals. SARS-MA15\u2013infected animals rapidly lost weight and succumbed to infection (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). SHC014-MA15 infection-induced robust and sustained weight loss, but had minimal lethality. Trends in the histology and antigen staining patterns that we observed in young mice were conserved in the older animals (Supplementary Table 3). We excluded the possibility that SHC014-MA15 was mediating infection through an alternative receptor on the basis of experiments using Ace2\u2212/\u2212 mice, which did not show weight loss or antigen staining after SHC014-MA15 infection (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Table 2). Together, the data indicate that viruses with the SHC014 spike are capable of inducing weight loss in mice in the context of a virulent CoV backbone.\n\nGiven the preclinical efficacy of Ebola monoclonal antibody therapies, such as ZMApp10, we next sought to determine the efficacy of SARS-CoV monoclonal antibodies against infection with SHC014-MA15. Four broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV spike protein had been previously reported and are probable reagents for immunotherapy11,12,13. We examined the effect of these antibodies on viral replication (expressed as percentage inhibition of viral replication) and found that whereas wild-type SARS-CoV Urbani was strongly neutralized by all four antibodies at relatively low antibody concentrations (Fig. 2a\u2013d), neutralization varied for SHC014-MA15. Fm6, an antibody generated by phage display and escape mutants11,12, achieved only background levels of inhibition of SHC014-MA15 replication (Fig. 2a). Similarly, antibodies 230.15 and 227.14, which were derived from memory B cells of SARS-CoV\u2013infected patients13, also failed to block SHC014-MA15 replication (Fig. 2b,c). For all three antibodies, differences between the SARS and SHC014 spike amino acid sequences corresponded to direct or adjacent residue changes found in SARS-CoV escape mutants (fm6 N479R; 230.15 L443V; 227.14 K390Q/E), which probably explains the absence of the antibodies\u2019 neutralizing activity against SHC014. Finally, monoclonal antibody 109.8 was able to achieve 50% neutralization of SHC014-MA15, but only at high concentrations (10 \u03bcg/ml) (Fig. 2d). Together, the results demonstrate that broadly neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV may only have marginal efficacy against emergent SARS-like CoV strains such as SHC014.\n\nFigure 2: SARS-CoV monoclonal antibodies have marginal efficacy against SARS-like CoVs.\n\n(a\u2013d) Neutralization assays evaluating efficacy (measured as a reduction in the number of plaques) of a panel of monoclonal antibodies, which were all originally generated against epidemic SARS-CoV, against infection of Vero cells with SARS-CoV Urbani (black) or SHC014-MA15 (green). The antibodies tested were fm6 (n = 3 for Urbani; n = 5 for SHC014-MA15)11,12 (a), 230.15 (n = 3 for Urbani; n = 2 for SHC014-MA15) (b), 227.15 (n = 3 for Urbani; n = 5 for SHC014-MA15) (c) and 109.8 (n = 3 for Urbani; n = 2 for SHC014-MA15)13 (d). Each data point represents the group mean and error bars define the s.e.m. Note that the error bars in SARS-CoV Urbani\u2013infected Vero cells in b,c are overlapped by the symbols and are not visible.\n\nFull size image\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy of existing vaccines against infection with SHC014-MA15, we vaccinated aged mice with double-inactivated whole SARS-CoV (DIV). Previous work showed that DIV could neutralize and protect young mice from challenge with a homologous virus14; however, the vaccine failed to protect aged animals in which augmented immune pathology was also observed, indicating the possibility of the animals being harmed because of the vaccination15. Here we found that DIV did not provide protection from challenge with SHC014-MA15 with regards to weight loss or viral titer (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). Consistent with a previous report with other heterologous groups 2b CoVs15, serum from DIV-vaccinated, aged mice also failed to neutralize SHC014-MA15 (Supplementary Fig. 5c).\n\nNotably, DIV vaccination resulted in robust immune pathology (Supplementary Table 4) and eosinophilia (Supplementary Fig. 5d\u2013f). Together, these results confirm that the DIV vaccine would not be protective against infection with SHC014 and could possibly augment disease in the aged vaccinated group.\n\nIn contrast to the vaccination of mice with DIV, the use of SHC014-MA15 as a live, attenuated vaccine showed potential cross-protection against challenge with SARS-CoV, but the results have important caveats. We infected young mice with 104 p.f.u. of SHC014-MA15 and observed them for 28 d. We then challenged the mice with SARS-MA15 at day 29 (Supplementary Fig. 6a). The prior infection of the mice with the high dose of SHC014-MA15 conferred protection against challenge with a lethal dose of SARS-MA15, although there was only a minimal SARS-CoV neutralization response from the antisera elicited 28 d after SHC014-MA15 infection (Supplementary Fig. 6b, 1:200). In the absence of a secondary antigen boost, 28 d.p.i. represents the expected peak of antibody titers and implies that there will be diminished protection against SARS-CoV over time16,17. Similar results showing protection against challenge with a lethal dose of SARS-CoV were observed in aged BALB/c mice with respect to weight loss and viral replication (Supplementary Fig. 6c,d). However, the SHC014-MA15 infection dose of 104 p.f.u. induced >10% weight loss and lethality in some aged animals (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3). We found that vaccination with a lower dose of SHC014-MA15 (100 p.f.u.), did not induce weight loss, but it also failed to protect aged animals from a SARS-MA15 lethal dose challenge (Supplementary Fig. 6e,f). Together, the data suggest that the SHC014-MA15 challenge may confer cross-protection against SARS-CoV through conserved epitopes, but the required dose induces pathogenesis and precludes use as an attenuated vaccine.\n\nHaving established that the SHC014 spike has the ability to mediate infection of human cells and cause disease in mice, we next synthesized a full-length SHC014-CoV infectious clone based on the approach used for SARS-CoV (Fig. 3a)2. Replication in Vero cells revealed no deficit for SHC014-CoV relative to that for SARS-CoV (Fig. 3b); however, SHC014-CoV was significantly (P < 0.01) attenuated in primary HAE cultures at both 24 and 48 h after infection (Fig. 3c). In vivo infection of mice demonstrated no significant weight loss but showed reduced viral replication in lungs of full-length SHC014-CoV infection, as compared to SARS-CoV Urbani (Fig. 3d,e). Together, the results establish the viability of full-length SHC014-CoV but suggest that further adaptation is required for its replication to be equivalent to that of epidemic SARS-CoV in human respiratory cells and in mice.\n\nFigure 3: Full-length SHC014-CoV replicates in human airways but lacks the virulence of epidemic SARS-CoV.\n\n(a) Schematic of the SHC014-CoV molecular clone, which was synthesized as six contiguous cDNAs (designated SHC014A, SHC014B, SHC014C, SHC014D, SHC014E and SHC014F) flanked by unique BglI sites that allowed for directed assembly of the full-length cDNA expressing open reading frames (for 1a, 1b, spike, 3, envelope, matrix, 6\u20138 and nucleocapsid). Underlined nucleotides represent the overhang sequences formed after restriction enzyme cleavage. (b,c) Viral replication of SARS-CoV Urbani (black) or SHC014-CoV (green) after infection of Vero cells (b) or well-differentiated, primary air-liquid interface HAE cell cultures (c) at an MOI of 0.01. Samples were collected at individual time points with biological replicates (n = 3) for each group. Data represent one experiment for both Vero and HAE cells. (d,e) Weight loss (n = 3 for SARS-CoV MA15, n = 7 for SHC014-CoV; n = 6 for SARS-Urbani) (d) and viral replication in the lungs (n = 3 for SARS-Urbani and SHC014-CoV) (e) of 10-week-old BALB/c mice infected with 1 \u00d7 105 p.f.u. of SARS-CoV MA15 (gray), SHC014-CoV (green) or SARS-CoV Urbani (black) via the i.n. route. Each data point represents the group mean, and error bars define the s.e.m. **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001 using two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test of individual time points.\n\nDuring the SARS-CoV epidemic, links were quickly established between palm civets and the CoV strains that were detected in humans4.\n\nBuilding on this finding, the common emergence paradigm argues that epidemic SARS-CoV originated as a bat virus, jumped to civets, and incorporated changes within the receptor-binding domain (RBD) to improve binding to civet Ace2 (ref. 18).\n\nSubsequent exposure to people in live-animal markets permitted human infection with the civet strain, which, in turn, adapted to become the epidemic strain (Fig. 4a).\n\nHowever, phylogenetic analysis suggests that early human SARS strains appear more closely related to bat strains than to civet strains18.\n\nTherefore, a second paradigm argues that direct bat-human transmission initiated SARS-CoV emergence and that palm civets served as a secondary host and reservoir for continued infection (Fig. 4b)19. For both paradigms, spike adaptation in a secondary host is seen as a necessity, with most mutations expected to occur within the RBD, thereby facilitating improved infection. Both theories imply that pools of bat CoVs are limited and that host-range mutations are both random and rare, reducing the likelihood of future emergence events in humans.\n\nFigure 4: Emergence paradigms for coronaviruses.\n\nCoronavirus strains are maintained in quasi-species pools circulating in bat populations. (a,b) Traditional SARS-CoV emergence theories posit that host-range mutants (red circle) represent random and rare occurrences that permit infection of alternative hosts. The secondary-host paradigm (a) argues that a nonhuman host is infected by a bat progenitor virus and, through adaptation, facilitates transmission to humans; subsequent replication in humans leads to the epidemic viral strain. The direct paradigm (b) suggests that transmission occurs between bats and humans without the requirement of an intermediate host; selection then occurs in the human population with closely related viruses replicating in a secondary host, permitting continued viral persistence and adaptation in both. (c) The data from chimeric SARS-like viruses argue that the quasi-species pools maintain multiple viruses capable of infecting human cells without the need for mutations (red circles). Although adaptations in secondary or human hosts may be required for epidemic emergence, if SHC014 spike\u2013containing viruses recombined with virulent CoV backbones (circles with green outlines), then epidemic disease may be the result in humans. Existing data support elements of all three paradigms.\n\nFull size image\n\nAlthough our study does not invalidate the other emergence routes, it does argue for a third paradigm in which circulating bat CoV pools maintain \u2018poised\u2019 spike proteins that are capable of infecting humans without mutation or adaptation (Fig. 4c). This hypothesis is illustrated by the ability of a chimeric virus containing the SHC014 spike in a SARS-CoV backbone to cause robust infection in both human airway cultures and in mice without RBD adaptation.\n\nCoupled with the observation of previously identified pathogenic CoV backbones3,20, our results suggest that the starting materials required for SARS-like emergent strains are currently circulating in animal reservoirs. Notably, although full-length SHC014-CoV probably requires additional backbone adaption to mediate human disease, the documented high-frequency recombination events in CoV families underscores the possibility of future emergence and the need for further preparation.\n\nTo date, genomics screens of animal populations have primarily been used to identify novel viruses in outbreak settings21. The approach here extends these data sets to examine questions of viral emergence and therapeutic efficacy. We consider viruses with the SHC014 spike a potential threat owing to their ability to replicate in primary human airway cultures, the best available model for human disease. In addition, the observed pathogenesis in mice indicates a capacity for SHC014-containing viruses to cause disease in mammalian models, without RBD adaptation.\n\nNotably, differential tropism in the lung as compared to that with SARS-MA15 and attenuation of full-length SHC014-CoV in HAE cultures relative to SARS-CoV Urbani suggest that factors beyond ACE2 binding\u2014including spike processivity, receptor bio-availability or antagonism of the host immune responses\u2014may contribute to the emergence. However, further testing in nonhuman primates is required to translate these findings into the pathogenic potential in humans.\n\nImportantly, the failure of available therapeutics defines a critical need for further study and for the development of treatments. With this knowledge, surveillance programs, diagnostic reagents, and effective treatments can be produced that are protective against the emergence of group 2b\u2013specific CoVs, such as SHC014, and these can be applied to other CoV branches that maintain similarly heterogeneous pools.\n\nIn addition to offering preparation against future emerging viruses, this approach must be considered in the context of the US government-mandated pause on gain-of-function (GOF) studies22.\n\nOn the basis of previous models of emergence (Fig. 4a,b), the creation of chimeric viruses such as SHC014-MA15 was not expected to increase pathogenicity. Although SHC014-MA15 is attenuated relative to its parental mouse-adapted SARS-CoV, similar studies examining the pathogenicity of CoVs with the wild-type Urbani spike within the MA15 backbone showed no weight loss in mice and reduced viral replication23. Thus, relative to the Urbani spike\u2013MA15 CoV, SHC014-MA15 shows again in pathogenesis (Fig. 1).\n\nOn the basis of these findings, scientific review panels may deem similar studies building chimeric viruses based on circulating strains too risky to pursue, as increased pathogenicity in mammalian models cannot be excluded.\n\nCoupled with restrictions on mouse-adapted strains and the development of monoclonal antibodies using escape mutants, research into CoV emergence and therapeutic efficacy may be severely limited moving forward. Together, these data and restrictions represent a crossroads of GOF research concerns; the potential to prepare for and mitigate future outbreaks must be weighed against the risk of creating more dangerous pathogens. In developing policies moving forward, it is important to consider the value of the data generated by these studies and whether these types of chimeric virus studies warrant further investigation versus the inherent risks involved.\n\nOverall, our approach has used metagenomics data to identify a potential threat posed by the circulating bat SARS-like CoV SHC014. Because of the ability of chimeric SHC014 viruses to replicate in human airway cultures, cause pathogenesis in vivo and escape current therapeutics, there is a need for both surveillance and improved therapeutics against circulating SARS-like viruses. Our approach also unlocks the use of metagenomics data to predict viral emergence and to apply this knowledge in preparing to treat future emerging virus infections.\n\nMethods\n\nViruses, cells, in vitro infection and plaque assays\n\nWild-type SARS-CoV (Urbani), mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15) and chimeric SARS-like CoVs were cultured on Vero E6 cells (obtained from United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases), grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) (Gibco, CA) and 5% fetal clone serum (FCS) (Hyclone, South Logan, UT) along with antibiotic/antimycotic (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA). DBT cells (Baric laboratory, source unknown) expressing ACE2 orthologs have been previously described for both human and civet; bat Ace2 sequence was based on that from Rhinolophus leschenaulti, and DBT cells expressing bat Ace2 were established as described previously8.\n\nPseudotyping experiments were similar to those using an HIV-based pseudovirus, prepared as previously described10, and examined on HeLa cells (Wuhan Institute of Virology) that expressed ACE2 orthologs. HeLa cells were grown in minimal essential medium (MEM) (Gibco, CA) supplemented with 10% FCS (Gibco, CA) as previously described24.\n\nGrowth curves in Vero E6, DBT, Calu-3 2B4, and primary human airway epithelial cells were performed as previously described8,25. None of the working cell line stocks were authenticated or tested for mycoplasma recently, although the original seed stocks used to create the working stocks are free from contamination. Human lungs for HAE cultures were procured under the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Institutional Review Board\u2013approved protocols. HAE cultures represent highly differentiated human airway epithelium containing ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial cells as well as goblet cells. The cultures are also grown on an air-liquid interface for several weeks before use, as previously described26.\n\nBriefly, cells were washed with PBS and inoculated with the virus or mock-diluted in PBS for 40 min at 37 \u00b0C. After inoculation, cells were washed three times and a fresh medium was added to signify time \u20180\u2019. Three or more biological replicates were harvested at each described time point. No blinding was used in any sample collections nor was samples randomized. All virus cultivation was performed in a biosafety level (BSL) 3 laboratory with redundant fans in the biosafety cabinets, as described previously by our group2. All personnel wore powered air-purifying respirators (Breathe Easy, 3M) with Tyvek suits, aprons, and booties and were double-gloved.\n\nSequence clustering and structural modeling.\n\nThe full-length genomic sequences and the amino acid sequences of the S1 domains of the spike of representative CoVs were downloaded from Genbank or Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC), aligned with ClustalX and phylogenetically compared by using maximum likelihood estimation using 100 bootstraps or by using the PhyML package, respectively. The tree was generated using maximum likelihood with the PhyML package. The scale bar represents nucleotide substitutions. Only nodes with bootstrap support above 70% are labeled.\n\nThe tree shows that CoVs are divided into three distinct phylogenetic groups defined as \u03b1-CoVs, \u03b2-CoVs, and \u03b3-CoVs. Classical subgroup clusters are marked as 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d for \u03b2-CoVs, and 1a and 1b for the \u03b1-CoVs. Structural models were generated using Modeller (Max Planck Institute Bioinformatics Toolkit) to generate homology models for SHC014 and Rs3367 of the SARS RBD in complex with ACE2 based on crystal structure 2AJF (Protein Data Bank). Homology models were visualized and manipulated in MacPyMol (version 1.3).\n\nConstruction of SARS-like chimeric viruses.\n\nBoth wild-type and chimeric viruses were derived from either SARS-CoV Urbani or the corresponding mouse-adapted (SARS-CoV MA15) infectious clone (ic) as previously described27.\n\nPlasmids containing spike sequences for SHC014 were extracted by restriction digest and ligated into the E and F plasmid of the MA15 infectious clone. The clone was designed and purchased from Bio Basic as six contiguous cDNAs using published sequences flanked by unique class II restriction endonuclease sites (BglI). Thereafter, plasmids containing wild-type, chimeric SARS-CoV, and SHC014-CoV genome fragments were amplified, excised, ligated, and purified.\n\nIn vitro transcription reactions were then performed to synthesize full-length genomic RNA, which was transfected into Vero E6 cells as previously described2. The medium from transfected cells was harvested and served as seed stocks for subsequent experiments. Chimeric and full-length viruses were confirmed by sequence analysis before use in these studies. Synthetic construction of chimeric mutant and full-length SHC014-CoV was approved by the University of North Carolina Institutional Biosafety Committee and the Dual Use Research of Concern committee.\n\nEthics statement\n\nThis study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations for the care and use of animals by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), NIH. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC, Permit Number A-3410-01) approved the animal study protocol (IACUC #13-033) used in these studies.\n\nMice and in vivo infection\n\nFemale, 10-week-old, and 12-month-old BALB/cAnNHsD mice were ordered from Harlan Laboratories. Mouse infections were done as previously described20. Briefly, animals were brought into a BSL3 laboratory and allowed to acclimate for 1 week before infection. For infection and live-attenuated virus vaccination, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine and infected intranasally, when challenged, with 50 \u03bcl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or diluted virus with three or four mice per time point, per infection group per dose as described in the figure legends.\n\nFor individual mice, notations for infection including failure to inhale the entire dose, bubbling of inoculum from the nose, or infection through the mouth may have led to exclusion of mouse data at the discretion of the researcher; post-infection, no other pre-established exclusion or inclusion criteria are defined. No blinding was used in any animal experiments, and animals were not randomized. For vaccination, young and aged mice were vaccinated by footpad injection with a 20-\u03bcl volume of either 0.2 \u03bcg of double-inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine with alum or mock PBS; mice were then boosted with the same regimen 22 d later and challenged 21 d thereafter.\n\nFor all groups, as per protocol, animals were monitored daily for clinical signs of disease (hunching, ruffled fur, and reduced activity) for the duration of the experiment. Weight loss was monitored daily for the first 7 d, after which weight monitoring continued until the animals recovered to their initial starting weight or displayed weight gain continuously for 3 d.\n\nAll mice that lost greater than 20% of their starting body weight were ground-fed and further monitored multiple times per day as long as they were under the 20% cutoff. Mice that lost greater than 30% of their starting body weight were immediately sacrificed as per protocol. Any mouse deemed to be moribund or unlikely to recover was also humanely sacrificed at the discretion of the researcher. Euthanasia was performed using an isoflurane overdose and death was confirmed by cervical dislocation. All mouse studies were performed at the University of North Carolina (Animal Welfare Assurance #A3410-01) using protocols approved by the UNC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n\nHistological analysis.\n\nThe left lung was removed and submerged in 10% buffered formalin (Fisher) without inflation for 1 week. Tissues were embedded in paraffin and 5-\u03bcm sections were prepared by the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center histopathology core facility. To determine the extent of antigen staining, sections were stained for viral antigen using a commercially available polyclonal SARS-CoV anti-nucleocapsid antibody (Imgenex) and scored in a blinded manner by for staining of the airway and parenchyma as previously described20. Images were captured using an Olympus BX41 microscope with an Olympus DP71 camera.\n\nVirus neutralization assays.\n\nPlaque reduction neutralization titer assays were performed with previously characterized antibodies against SARS-CoV, as previously described11,\n\n12,13\n\n. Briefly, neutralizing antibodies or serum was serially diluted twofold and incubated with 100 p.f.u. of the different infectious clone, SARS-CoV strains for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. The virus and antibodies were then added to a 6-well plate with 5 \u00d7 105 Vero E6 cells/well with multiple replicates (n \u2265 2). After a 1-h incubation at 37 \u00b0C, cells were overlaid with 3 ml of 0.8% agarose in a medium. Plates were incubated for 2 d at 37 \u00b0C, stained with neutral red for 3 h, and plaques were counted. The percentage of plaque reduction was calculated as (1 \u2212 (no. of plaques with an antibody/no. of plaques without antibody)) \u00d7 100.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nAll experiments were conducted contrasting two experimental groups (either two viruses, or vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts). Therefore, significant differences in viral titer and histology scoring were determined by a two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test at individual time points. Data were normally distributed in each group being compared and had similar variance.\n\nBiosafety and biosecurity\n\nReported studies were initiated after the University of North Carolina Institutional Biosafety Committee approved the experimental protocol (Project Title: Generating infectious clones of bat SARS-like CoVs; Lab Safety Plan ID: 20145741; Schedule G ID: 12279).\n\nThese studies were initiated before the US Government Deliberative Process Research Funding Pause on Selected Gain-of-Function Research Involving Influenza, MERS, and SARS Viruses. This paper has been reviewed by the funding agency, the NIH. Continuation of these studies was requested, and this has been approved by the NIH.\n\nSARS-CoV is a select agent. All work for these studies was performed with approved standard operating procedures (SOPs) and safety conditions for SARS-CoV, MERs-CoV, and other related CoVs. Our institutional CoV BSL3 facilities have been designed to conform to the safety requirements that are recommended in the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL), the US Department of Health and Human Services, the Public Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the NIH. Laboratory safety plans were submitted to, and the facility has been approved for use by, the UNC Department of Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) and the CDC. Electronic card access is required for entry into the facility.\n\nAll workers have been trained by EHS to safely use powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), and appropriate work habits in a BSL3 facility and active medical surveillance plans are in place. Our CoV BSL3 facilities contain redundant fans, emergency power to fans and biological safety cabinets and freezers, and our facilities can accommodate SealSafe mouse racks. Materials classified as BSL3 agents consist of SARS-CoV, bat CoV precursor strains, MERS-CoV and mutants derived from these pathogens. Within the BSL3 facilities, experimentation with an infectious virus is performed in a certified Class II Biosafety Cabinet (BSC).\n\nAll members of the staff wear scrubs, Tyvek suits and aprons, PAPRs and shoe covers, and their hands are double-gloved. BSL3 users are subject to a medical surveillance plan monitored by the University Employee Occupational Health Clinic (UEOHC), which includes a yearly physical, annual influenza vaccination and mandatory reporting of any symptoms associated with CoV infection during periods when working in the BSL3. All BSL3 users are trained in exposure management and reporting protocols, are prepared to self-quarantine and have been trained for safe delivery to a local infectious disease management department in an emergency situation. All potential exposure events are reported and investigated by EHS and UEOHC, with reports filed to both the CDC and the NIH.\n\nAccession codes\n\nAccessions\n\nProtein Data Bank\n\n2AJF\n\nChange history\n\n20 November 2015\n\nIn the version of this article initially published online, the authors omitted to acknowledge a funding source, USAID-EPT-PREDICT funding from EcoHealth Alliance, to Z.-L.S.

        "Foreseeing another potentially deadly wave of coronavirus cases, German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach traveled to the United States last week to coordinate a strategy for the upcoming fall and winter. If no new measures are taken, Lauterbach warned on July 22, the number of covid-19 cases will rise sharply and intensive care units will be overloaded. \u201cIt\u2019s like a candle burning at both ends,\u201d with potentially \u201ccatastrophic\u201d results, he cautioned.\n\nSpiegel reported that during his visit, Lauterbach met with Dr. Anthony Fauci, exchanged views with U.S. partners on the fight against the coronavirus, and discussed preparations for future pandemics.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious that lockdowns haven\u2019t had the promised positive effect. Johns Hopkins University found that pandemic lockdowns prevented only 0.2 percent of covid-19 deaths. Add the economic havoc, mental turmoil and social unrest they caused, and you quickly see they were a disaster.\n\nThere is indication that Dr. Fauci knew that these measures would do little to nothing to prevent the so-called pandemic from spreading. In March 2020, he said: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you\u2019re in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it\u2019s not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is. And, often, there are unintended consequences\u2014people keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face.\u201d Despite this sound advice, he later supported nationwide mask mandates.\n\nAs Trumpet editor in chief Gerald Flurry writes in America Under Attack, the measures taken against covid-19 may have not saved people\u2019s lives, but they succeeded in another goal. He explains:\n\nVery importantly, drastic government actions made possible only by coronavirus fears revolutionized elections in America. The push for mail-in balloting and other loosening of or illegally breaking long-standing election standards that protect against fraud could only have happened by heavily marketed virus fears. covid-19 enabled the Democratic Party to field a presidential candidate who could not endure the rigors of a national campaign and who electioneered through Zoom calls from his basement. covid-19 made it possible for Joe Biden to host a limited number of \u201crallies\u201d attended by handpicked individuals seated in sparse numbers of chairs spaced far apart from each other. covid-19 guaranteed a historically bizarre campaign and unprecedented election that installed Barack Obama\u2019s choice for president in the White House.\n\nPresident Donald Trump called out these measures as unconstitutional. Even weeks before the 2020 election, he said that mail-in ballots were an attempt to steal the election. U.S. Democrats ridiculed him, and Germany supported their narrative, giving them more weight on the international stage.\n\nGermany and U.S. Democrats have often supported each other\u2019s policies. They also share a common enemy: Donald Trump. Like no other president in recent history, Trump has exposed Germany\u2019s cooperation with Russia and other dubious dealings. Under Mr. Trump, the U.S. sanctioned Germany for building the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and pressured the country to contribute more to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Mr. Trump also called out Germany\u2019s trade surplus toward the U.S., claiming it was a sign of unfair policies.\n\nAs fall midterm elections approach, conservatives fear that this election could also be held under unprecedented circumstances. But the fact that Germany supports these unconstitutional covid measures makes them appear more credible.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen what will happen in the next few months, one thing is sure: There is a coordinated strategy to keep Donald Trump out of office. The Bible, however, reveals that Mr. Trump will return to power.\n\nIn America Under Attack, Mr. Flurry explains that President Trump is an end-time type of ancient Israel\u2019s King Jeroboam ii. A prophecy in 2 Kings 14:26-28 shows that this leader, also spoken of in the book of Amos, will be used by God to temporarily save Israel and prevent it from being \u201cblotted out.\u201d These verses speak of an attack from within to destroy the biblical foundation of America that connects it with its ancestors, the ancient Israelites (read The United States and Britain in Prophecy for proof). For this reason, we can be sure that everything will be done to prevent Donald Trump\u2019s return to power. A renewed push for covid measures may be part of it.\n\nTo understand where these events are leading, request a free copy of America Under Attack.",
        "No matter your thoughts on the coronavirus, there is no denying the damage it has caused to America, the economy, and countless families across the country. From government overreach to media misinformation, it appears the officials who are in charge only know how to do one thing \u2013 throw money at the pandemic. Over the course of COVID-19, the government seemed more than generous with approving stimulus packages aimed at keeping American families afloat, but come to find out, those payments were rather small when compared to what Michigan county officials paid themselves using COVID-19 funds.\n\nWith the news breaking this week, many Michigan voters are wanting answers as reports show that elected officials used $65,000 of relief money to make themselves richer. And to make it even worse, they are all Republicans. Voting on the matter last week, Commissioners in Shiawassee County decided to award public employees, including themselves, with a one-time bonus of $1,000. Deeming it \u201chazard pay\u201d, most employees received far more than just $1,000.\n\nAccording to reports, the average employee was given around $2,100, and that doesn\u2019t include top-level employees like the county board chairman, Jeremy Root. He generously received $25,000 while second-tier commissioners like Brandon Marks and John Plowman were awarded $10,000 apiece. The remaining officials were given around $5,000 each. It should be noted that the County commissioners are currently paid $10,000 annually for their part-time jobs.\n\nEven with the shocking revelation, one county commissioner, Cindy Garber, stood by the decision, claiming she deserved the money. \u201cI think that I earned it. I work really hard at this job. I was here in person all through this crazy year.\u201d Although it has been a crazy year, Garber seems to forget that all Americans, especially the working class, experienced the same hardships as those elected officials. \u2013 READ MORE",
        "The U.S. Department of Justice has opted against investigating any of the Democrat governors who last year ordered nursing homes to accept residents who tested positive for COVID-19 against the recommendations of health groups.\n\nFederal officials reviewed information they received from New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and New Jersey last year regarding the orders.\n\nBased on the review, they\u2019re not opening Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA) investigations in the first three states, Joe Gaeta, deputy assistant attorney general, told Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) in a letter on July 23. The act enables the attorney general to initiate a case in court against a state or local government, or its employees or agents, when officials suspect or find that people in institutions owned or run by such a government have had their rights denied.\n\nThe Department of Justice opened a CRIPA probe into conditions at two nursing facilities operated by the state of New Jersey in October 2020 but has given no indication that it\u2019s investigating Gov. Phil Murphy.\n\nScalise, the ranking member of the House Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, reacted strongly to the refusal to investigate Murphy or governors of the other states, all of whom are Democrats. \u2013 READ MORE",
