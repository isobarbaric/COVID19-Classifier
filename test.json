Sex and presence of chronic disease were 7 both found to be relatively unimportant, and the two global interpretation techniques differed in 8 ranking them. Additionally, this paper creates partial dependence plots to determine and 9 visualize the marginal effect of each factor on COVID-19 mortality and demonstrates how local 10 interpretation of COVID-19 mortality prediction can be applicable in a clinical setting. Lastly, 11 this paper derives clinically applicable decision rules about mortality probabilities through a 12 parsimonious 3-split surrogate tree, demonstrating that high-accuracy COVID-19 mortality 13 prediction can be achieved with simple, interpretable models."
