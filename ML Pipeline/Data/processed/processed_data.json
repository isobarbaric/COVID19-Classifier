        "text":"Answer: Before we get into specifics, let's start with a quick overview of the types of tests for coronavirus. Types of COVID-19 Tests There are basically two types of tests for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19: Virus test This test detects the virus (SARS-CoV-2) to help determine if you have a current infection. Although you can be infectious before showing any symptoms, the virus is best detected during the first week of symptoms (which is about two weeks after becoming infected from exposure) (Sethuraman, JAMA 2020). There are two type of virus tests: the PCR and antigen test. Early in the pandemic, both tests had to be performed in a laboratory or clinic with special rapid, portable machines, but rapid, home-based PCR and antigen tests have become available. There are also at-home sampling kits by which you can collect your own sample and drop it off or mail it to a lab, which will report PCR results back to you. Virus tests are typically done by collecting a sample of mucous from a nose swab (typically from the nasopharynx or nostril) or saliva or oral swabs. There is some evidence that virus detection may be better with samples from saliva or the mouth or throat (Blythe, medRxiv 2021 \u2014 preprint; Wyllie, Correspondence in JAMA, 2020), but most tests (and all antigen tests) authorized for use in the U.S. rely on samples from the nose and the FDA has advised against using antigen tests designed for the nose to be used in the mouth. Nevertheless, a study in the Netherlands, showed that an antigen test (BD Veritor) was able to detect about 20% more positive cases using samples collected first from the throat (around the tonsils) and then from the nose than with samples just from the nose. The combined samples were also used on Roche's SD Biosensor (aka COVI9-19 At-Home Test) antigen test which was even more accurate than BD Veritor (Zwart, medRxiv 2022 -- preprint). (Interestingly, one antigen test in the UK utilizes a swab of the throat (tonsils) that is then used to swab one nostril.) An apparent benefit of sampling from the throat is that the virus appears at higher levels there about a day earlier than in the nose, although levels then rise higher in the nose and remain higher there for a longer period, as shown in a study of people in the UK given COVID-19 by being infected with virus in their nose (Killingly, In Review 2022 -- preprint). Using only a swab from the inside of the check, however, was shown to identify only 2 positive cases out of 22 that were positive with nostril swabs in a small study that used the Abbott BinaxNow antigen test (Schrom, medRxiv 2022 \u2014 preprint). The PCR test uses a technique that amplifies genetic material (RNA) from the virus. This can take as little as a few minutes or several hours. The FDA has authorized at-home sampling kits with which you can collect your own sample and drop it off or mail it to a lab, which will report the results back to you. It has also authorized at-home PCR tests that take about 20 to 60 minutes. Home PCR tests are more expensive than home antigen tests but may detect infections earlier than antigen tests. (Sign in to see our reviews of home PCR tests from Cue, Detect, and Lucira, and to see our Top Pick among these.) Update (12\/14\/22): Certain lots of an over-the-counter PCR COVID test were recalled due to an increased chance that the tests may yield false negative results. Sign in for details. An analysis of tests performed among symptomatic and asymptomatic patients at Vanderbilt University Medical Center showed that the proportion of samples testing positive on PCR tests were twice as high at 2 pm than in the morning, decreasing later in the afternoon and evening. Researchers proposed this may indicate that test accuracy varies by time of day and could have public health implications (McNaughton, medRxiv 2021 -- preprint). Update: In addition to the many commercial PCR tests that have received Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA, the CDC has been producing its own, FDA-authorized, PCR test. More recently, the CDC developed a newer test that can simultaneously test for and distinguish between COVID, influenza A and influenza B, and, as of January 1, 2022, it will withdraw the older test. Sign in to find out why. The antigen test identifies a protein (or \"antigen\") that is specifically found on the virus. Advantages of the antigen test are that it can provide results in as little as 15 minutes and can be produced at lower cost, lending itself to wider use in screening. In addition, only a nasal swab is needed from the nostrils, not a much deeper, nasopharyngeal swab. The downside with antigen tests is that they are more likely to provide a false negative result than a gene amplification test; that is, it's more likely to identify your sample as negative when you are actually positive. Consequently, negative results from an antigen test should be repeated within three days, but at least 36 hours later (or confirmed with a PCR test) for people who are at high-risk of infection \u2014 but a positive antigen result is highly likely to be accurate. False negatives may also occur with emerging viral variants, if the variants have significant mutations of the target antigen. However, most popular antigen tests in the U.S. target nucleocapsid antigen, which is still present in variants such as Delta and Omicron. Be aware of a common mistake made when reading rapid home antigen tests and that one of the chemicals in these tests can cause skin irritation and other symptoms if mishandled. Sign in for details about benefits and limitations of rapid antigen testing for the Omicron variant and find out how likely are you to still be contagious if you test positive on a rapid antigen test after a 5-day isolation. Be aware that one of the chemicals home antigen tests can cause skin irritation and other symptoms if mishandled. Several home antigen tests have been authorized by the FDA and are available, such as Abbott BinaxNow Self Test, BD Veritor, Celltrion DiaTrust COVID-19 Ag Home Test, CLINITEST, Flowflex, iHealth, INDICAID COVID-19 Rapid Antigen At-Home Tests, InteliSwab, On\/Go (AccessBio CareStart), Roche At-Home, and Quidel QuickVue. However, there important differences in the accuracy of these tests, their shelf-lives and stability in freezing temperatures, and their cost. Also, versions of some of these tests have been recalled. [Sign in for our comparison of antigen tests and our Top Picks.] UPDATE [2\/8\/23]: You can now anonymously report at-home COVID test results (positive or negative), for you or a member of your family, to the government at makemytestcount.org in order to help researchers better understand how these tests are being used. Only age and zip code are required. Antibody test This test detects antibodies to the virus and requires blood \u2014 either a drop or a vial \u2014 to determine if you have been infected in the past and have developed some level of immunity. This test (also called a serology test) can be run in a laboratory or on a test strip, although even test strips must be used in an authorized facility, not at home. As it takes time to develop antibodies that can be detected, antibody tests are most accurate when performed at least 20 days after the first disease symptoms and may be most accurate (in terms of not missing antibodies that are present) 4 months or longer after a positive virus test. This was shown in study of 486 COVID patients in California in which the likelihood of a positive antibody (IgG) test result increased with time after a positive virus test. Antibody tests were most accurate (~80%) among those ages 40 to 59 years and least accurate (~65%) among those 70+ or under 40. The tests were more accurate for men than women (79% vs 72%) (Vashisht, JAMA Netw Open 2021). Tests focus on levels of the antibody IgG, which persists without much decline for several weeks, but may include levels of IgM which fall off more rapidly (Sethuraman, JAMA 2020). These tests look for antibodies to specific parts of the virus, namely its spike proteins (proteins on the outside of the virus that can bind to receptors on human cells) or nucleocapsid proteins (proteins inside the virus). An advantage to testing for antibodies to the nucleocapsid is that these antibodies can be easier to detect, however, antibodies to the spike proteins are believed to be more important in conferring immunity against the virus, as these antibodies may block viral entry into cells \u2014 although antibodies to nucleocapsid proteins may still serve as proxies for immunity. See Finding the Best COVID-19 Test \u2014 Antibody Test to learn which marketed tests target each protein. Although it is not recommended that antibody tests be relied upon to determine the effectiveness of vaccines, be aware that only tests that focus on antibodies to spike protein would be useful for this purpose because the authorized vaccines generate antibodies only to spike proteins. A negative result on a nucleocapsid antibody test provides no information about the effectiveness of a vaccine although it would suggest that a person has not had COVD-19. The list of authorized antibody tests below indicates whether a test focuses on spike, nucleocapsid, or both types of proteins. If, at some point, tests for spike protein antibodies are indicated for assessing antibody response to COVID-19 vaccines, those that provide a quantitative or semi-quantitative measurement, will be more useful than those that provide only a yes\/no answer. Sign in for more information about antibody tests that focus on the spike protein and are semi-quantitative, including one that is available from a major U.S. laboratory. Note: Avoid taking large doses \u2014 10,000 mcg or more \u2014 of biotin (a B vitamin) for several days before an antibody test, as biotin may skew results. Sign in to learn which tests may be affected by biotin. Another way our bodies fight the virus is with T cells. Preliminary research suggests that even if antibody levels are too low to be detected, people previously infected with the virus may produce enough T cell response to provide immunity (Sekine, MediRxiv 2020). However, currently authorized tests do not measure this type of immunity, and one should still apply distancing and health precautions regardless of test results. Some labs may provide you with an index value that reflects the strength of the antibody signal produced from your test. Higher antibody levels generate higher signals and higher index values. The interpretation of these index values depends on the test used. For example, for a particular test the cut-offs could be \"less than 1.01\" for negative, \"1.01 to less than 1.21\" for indeterminate, and \"greater than or equal to 1.21\" for positive (Theel, J Clin Microbio 2020). Or, there could just be a single cut-off index value of, say, 1.40 for positive, with anything below being negative (Example: Abbott Alinity -- https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/media\/137910\/download). If you would like to know your index value, be sure to check that the lab you use provides the value. Who is checking these tests? To speed the availability of tests, rather than put these through its normal approval process, the FDA has provided a special emergency use allowance (EUA) for tests that, although imperfect, may be useful at this time. So there are actually no FDA \"approved\" SARS-CoV-2 virus tests, but a list of \"FDA authorized\" tests. The FDA allowances are based on data submitted by the test manufacturers, but the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other government laboratories are now conducting independent tests of these tests and the FDA has been making the results public (see results in the Finding the Best COVID-19 Test section and watch for further announcements in our newsletter.) Several other organizations around the world have been testing the test and\/or certifying virus and antibody tests. The European Union's has been certifying tests, conferring on them its CE (Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne) mark, and the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has been doing the same. Researchers in California, Denmark, and elsewhere have been testing the antibody tests. Be aware that in June 2020 the FDA warned consumers about at-home antibody tests being sold without FDA clearance or approval and issued warning letters to three companies selling these tests. Some of these tests were falsely labeled as FDA approved. [Update (August 19, 2020): The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that CLIA- certified laboratories are no longer required to notify the FDA, nor request its authorization, for tests they develop in-house. It is not clear what information about such tests will be maintained or published. This change could allow for novel tests to become available more quickly but eliminates oversight by the FDA, creating more of a buyer-beware situation. Labs may, voluntarily, still choose to apply to the FDA, and the FDA will continue to publish information about tests submitted this way. If in doubt, ask your doctor or lab if the test you are considering is authorized for use by the FDA. (Links to the FDA information are provided in the Finding the Best COVID-19 Test section. Where to Get COVID-19 Tests Virus Test To date, the FDA has permitted the use of over 90 virus tests. The vast majority must be performed on a sample collected in a medical setting, such as in a doctor's office, a diagnostic laboratory, or a drive-through facility, but the FDA has also begun authorizing at-home sample collection tests for the virus. Local testing (often free) Although you can ask your doctor for a virus test, you may be able to arrange to get a virus test for free from your state or local government. You can also go to a diagnostic laboratory or testing center, including some pharmacies. The test may be covered by your insurance or the government based on an assessment of your risk level. Here are some examples of testing programs around the country. Project Baseline works with community based screening programs in locations in several states to offer free virus testing. You must fill out an online questionnaire and be accepted. You will then be given an appointment at local testing center where a sample will be collected with a self-nasal swab or a nasopharyngeal swab. The project is sponsored by the parent company of Google through its health unit, Verily, and a Google email account is needed to complete questionnaire online. Rite Aid Pharmacies in some locations are participating in Project Baseline, providing testing at no cost to anyone 18+ years of age. CVS (including MinuteClinic and HealthHUB) had originally offered drive-up, rapid testing using the Abbott ID NOW system, a small, portable device that yields results in 13 minutes or less. Unfortunately, this system was been reported to yield a high percentage of false negative results due to lower sensitivity than other systems. That is, a negative result may need to be confirmed using another test (Basu, bioRxiv 2020 preprint). (For more details, see Finding the Best COVID-19 Test , below). Virus testing is still offered, but specimens are now sent to independent, third-party labs for processing, and test results are available in approximately three to four days. Walgreens offers drive-up testing in which you perform your own nasal swab. You sample is sent to a laboratory and you are notified by email or phone when results are available. (Originally results were promised within 24 hours). Kroger Health offers public drive-thru and walk-up COVID-19 testing. At-home tests The FDA has authorized several fully self-administered virus tests (providing rapid results) or test kits (to be sent into a lab) for use at home. Currently, two of these (Abbott BinaxNOW Antigen Self-Test and Quidel QuickVue) can be purchased at pharmacies and take about 15 minutes. Note that these will not provide you with a digital pass for events, airlines, or restaurants. Another version of the BinaxNOW Antigen test (the \"home\" version) provides a digital Navica pass, but this test must be purchased online (at about twice the cost) and many venues may not accept the digital pass. Update: On October 1, 2021, 200,000 test kits of another COVID-19 home test were recalled due to a manufacturing defect causing false positive results (i.e., indicating that someone has COVID-19 when they do not). For details, including what to do if you've used this home test, sign in to the full answer, which also includes details about four other currently available at-home tests. Update: Since the end of January 2022, people living in the U.S. (including U.S. Territories or those with overseas military and diplomatic addresses, i.e., APO\/FPO\/DPO) have been eligible to order limited quantities of free at-home antigen tests through www.covidtests.gov. Although the program was suspended in September 2022 due to lack of funding, every U.S. household can once again order four free at-home COVID-?19 tests during winter of 2022\/2023. Antibody Test As with virus tests, many laboratories have received FDA approval to conduct antibody tests, some of which are very accurate. Although the FDA has not approved or authorized rapid, home tests for antibodies, many such tests are available in other parts of the world and some have been sold in the U.S. The FDA has authorized one rapid antibody test for use at point-of-care settings, i.e., non-laboratory medical settings such as in medical offices and pharmacies. Through a local healthcare provider Your healthcare provider can arrange for you to get an antibody test if deemed appropriate. Blood would be drawn either by your provider or at nearby diagnostic laboratory. Similarly, many walk-in, urgent care centers can arrange for you to have the test, for a fee, which may be covered by your insurance. The samples are typically sent to a commercial laboratory, so results can take a few days. Consumer-initiated testing Be aware than in many cases, the cost of antibody tests may be covered by insurance if ordered by your physician or health care provider. Some labs will require payment for consumer-initiated tests, while others will bill your insurance. Be sure to check the payment policy of the lab you plan to use if requesting your own test. You can also check if your insurance company covers COVID-19 testing. Medicare often covers the full cost of COVID-19 virus and antibody tests. If you are uninsured, health care providers can submit a claim to have virus and antibody tests covered by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. QuestDirect allows consumers to request a COVID-19 IgG antibody test and pay for it online ($119 plus a $10.30 physician oversight fee). An appointment is made for a blood draw at one of Quest Diagnostics 2,200 patient service centers and test results are available online one to two days later. Interested consumers must not have experienced symptoms of COVID-19 for at least 10 days. Quest has stated that the testing will initially rely on antibody tests run on the Abbott Architect and EUROIMMUN systems. Labcorp also allows consumers to request a test directly through its website. According to the website, there is no up-front out-of-pocket cost for consumer initiated tests, but you will be charged a $10 fee for physician oversight services (there is no physician oversight fee if the test order comes directly from your own physician or healthcare provider). Labcorp will \"bill the cost of the COVID-19 IgG antibody test directly to your insurance carrier, or if uninsured, to the appropriate government program.\" Antibody tests offered by Labcorp include Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV02 (IgG), and DiaSorin SARS-CoV-2. You can see how each of these tests compare in the Finding the Best COVID-19 Test section below. Rapid, home tests The FDA has not yet approved or authorized of the use of any rapid, home antibody tests but several have been approved by the European Union, which provides its CE mark (Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne) and\/or by the Chinese National Medical Products Association (NMPA). In addition, research groups have been evaluating these tests. Some of these tests have been marketed in the U.S. without FDA approval or allowance. Finding the Best COVID-19 Test There are now more than 90 virus tests (including a recently approved saliva test) and 22 antibody tests for COVID-19 authorized by the FDA. ConsumerLab has reviewed the data on their performance and assessed which appear to be the best antibody tests for COVID-19. We've added this information for ConsumerLab members. Sign in as a member or become a member now to learn how specific brands of virus and antibody tests compare, which currently appear to be the best, where to get them, and whether any of the tests can identify which variant caused an infection. What Does a Negative Antibody Test Mean? If you took a coronavirus antibody test and it came back negative, it can mean one of several things: The test was not sensitive enough to detect antibodies that existed. This is more likely if the test had a sensitivity of less than 100% (see Finding the Best COVID-19 Test \u2014 Antibody Test for sensitivities of FDA-authorized tests); for sensitivities of FDA-authorized tests); You may have never had COVID-19; You took the test too early -- generally less than 20 days after first disease symptoms, although, according to the CDC, some people may take longer; or You didn't develop levels of antibodies high enough to be detected by tests -- which preliminary research suggests may happen in mild and asymptomatic cases (Long, Nature Med 2020). There is currently not enough data to know if a negative result could result from taking the test too late. More research is needed to determine how long significant levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 persist. The CDC cautions, \"Regardless of whether you test positive or negative, the results do not confirm whether or not you are able to spread the virus that causes COVID-19. Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others.\" This article will be updated as new information is obtained.",

        "text":"Answer: N95 masks are the gold standard, but other good options exist if you do not have an N95, primarily KN95 masks and well-made, well-fitting, 3-layer cloth masks. Disposable surgical masks are also readily available but tend to leave gaps between the mask and face, reducing their usefulness (although there are ways to improve it). If you want to find and buy a good mask that meets the guidelines of the U.S. CDC as well as the World Health Organization, go right to Best Cloth Masks You Can Buy. If you want an N95 respirator, see Finding the Best N95 Masks section. If you want a KN95 respirator, see the Finding the Best KN95 Masks section. If you want to make your own mask (which can be quite effective) see the Best combination of materials for making a mask section. We also identify what seem to be the best disposable filter materials. Masks can be used alone or, for increased protection, particularly for the eyes, with a face shield \u2014 which we have also reviewed. Here's what we cover in this answer: Why and when you should wear a mask While vaccination to protect against COVID-19 has led to a decreased need for masking in certain situations, unvaccinated individuals are still advised to wear a mask when in public indoor settings. In addition, due to concerns about the spread of the Delta and Omicron variants, masks are recommended for fully vaccinated individuals when in indoor spaces with high community transmission rates, as well as for fully vaccinated individuals with compromised immune systems or who are taking immune-suppressing drugs. Masks are also required for all individuals, regardless of vaccination status, when required by federal, state, local, tribal or territorial laws (including local business and workplace guidance), on public transportation, and in healthcare settings. (Get more details about masking guidelines for fully vaccinated individuals in our article about COVID vaccines). Along with social distancing, a mask provides additional protection from infecting others as well as preventing exposure. In addition, according to the CDC, \"cloth mask materials can also reduce wearers' exposure to infectious droplets through filtration, including filtration of fine droplets and particles less than 10 microns.\" A review of studies found that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses was 82% lower with physical distancing of 1 meter (3.3 feet) or more, compared with shorter distances, and protection might increase with additional distance. Face mask use could result in an 85% reduction in risk of infection versus no face mask, with stronger associations for N-95 or similar respirators, while surgical masks and multi-layered cotton masks were less effective but offered more protection than single-layer masks (Chu, Lancet 2020). As wearing a mask may reduce the amount of virus to which a wearer is exposed, it has been postulated that even if a mask-wearing person becomes infected, the reduced viral load to which they were exposed may mean that they suffer a milder disease. For example, on cruise ships with COVID-19 outbreaks, the majority of infected patients (81%) were asymptomatic on a ship that had provided masks to all passengers and staff compared to only 18% of cases being asymptomatic on a cruise ship without masking (Gandhi, J Gen Intern Med 2020; Gandhi, N Engl J Med 2020). Another benefit of wearing a mask is that, due to the heat and moisture of exhaled breath, masks have been shown to increase the humidity and temperature of inhaled air, which, researchers have proposed, may reduce the risk of respiratory infections such as COVID by promoting the clearance of pathogens in the lungs (Courtney, Biophysical J 2021 -- preprint). Although previously reserved for healthcare workers to due a shortages in supply, the CDC advised on January 14, 2022 that N95 and KN95 respirators may be worn by the general public, with the exception of surgical N95 respirators, which are standardized for fluid resistance, i.e. blood splatter, and continue to be reserved for use in healthcare settings. In its updated guidance regarding masks and respirators the agency stated, \"While all masks and respirators provide some level of protection, properly fitted respirators provide the highest level of protection.\" (See our reviews of N95 and KN95 respirators below.) It also emphasized that use of well-fitted masks and respirators are particularly important in high-risk situations and for people who may be at risk for more severe disease. [Note: On January 19, 2022, the U.S. government announced that it will make approximately 400 million N95 respirators available free of charge to the public, possibly as early as the week of January 24th. According to a New York Times article about the announcement, the N95s will be distributed through community centers and retail pharmacies and will be limited to three per person. Details about brands or models were not provided.] If using a cloth or disposable mask, be sure it fully covers the nose and mouth. Clear panel masks are acceptable to facilitate communication with people who are hearing impaired or who otherwise need to see a speaker's mouth in order to communicate. In addition to fully covering the nose and mouth, masks should also fulfill the following guidelines: Cloth masks should be made with two or more layers of a breathable fabric that is tightly woven (i.e., fabrics that do not let light pass through when held up to a light source). (See our Top Picks among cloth masks that meet these requirements. ) If gaiters are worn, they should have two layers of fabric or be folded to make two layers. ) If gaiters are worn, they should have two layers of fabric or be folded to make two layers. Masks should fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face. Masks should be a solid piece of material without slits, exhalation valves, or punctures. Scarves, ski masks, turtlenecks pulled over the face, masks made from loosely woven material, and masks with slits, exhalation valves, or punctures are not acceptable. Face shields and goggles can be worn with masks, but cannot be worn instead of a mask. (See our Top Pick among face shields). Failure to wear a mask as described above is a violation of federal law and can be enforced by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and state and local authorities. The TSA has proposed a fine of $250 for the first offense up to $1,500 for repeat offenders (TSA 2021). However, there are several exceptions to the requirement: Masks may be removed for brief periods of time when eating, drinking, or taking medication, while communicating with someone who is hearing impaired, when required to verify one's identity, and when requested by a ticket agent or law enforcement officer. Any benefit to wearing masks at home? Although CDC guidelines do not currently include the use of face masks at home, the rate of transmission from one household family member to another was 79% lower when members wore face masks prior to the first member developing COVID-19 symptoms, according to a study of 124 families in Beijing in which there was at least one infected person. Overall, there was a 23% rate of transmission of COVID-19 from an infected family member to another, but this was no lower when mask wearing began after the first member developed symptoms. These results are consistent with the fact that viral load is highest two days before symptoms and on the first day of symptoms. Daily use of disinfectants reduced transmission by 77%. Transmission rates were four times higher if the primary case had diarrhea and 18 times higher when there was frequent daily close contact (less than 3 feet apart). The researchers recommended use of face masks in families in which a member has been at risk of getting infected. In China, over 70% of transmission occurred within families (Wang, BMJ Global Health 2020). Best combination of materials for making a mask Currently, both the CDC and WHO provide basic guidelines for choosing a cloth mask. According to CDC guidelines, a cloth mask should: Use a minimum of 2 - 3 layers, preferably with batting between the layers Use fabrics with high thread count and fine weave, water-resistant fabric, and hybrid fabrics such as cotton-silk, cotton-chiffon, or cotton-flannel (cotton blends may be better than pure cotton). (In addition, the CDC notes that, due to their electrostatic charge, materials such as polypropylene may enhance filtration efficacy and fabrics such as silk can help to repel droplets.) Cover the nose and chin Fit snugly on the sides of the face without gaps Be secured with ties or ear loops Use ties rather than ear loops because ties provide better fit It also advises that if wearing a neck gaiter, choose one with two layers or fold it to make two layers. In addition, the CDC warns not to choose masks that are: Made of fabric that makes it hard to breathe, such as vinyl Have exhalation valves or vents, as this allows virus particles to escape Reserverd for healthcare workers (i.e. surgical N95s The World Health Organization (WHO) provides more details about which types of fabrics may work best. It recommends using three layers of fabric for non-medical, cloth masks in order to achieve the best combination of filtration efficacy and breathability: 1. Innermost layer: Hydrophilic material (i.e., one that can absorb moisture, such as cotton or cotton blends) 2. Middle layer: Hydrophobic material (i.e., repels moisture) of synthetic non-woven material such as polypropylene or a second cotton layer which may enhance filtration or retain droplets. 3. Outermost layer: Hydrophobic material (e.g., polypropylene, polyester, or their blends) which may limit external contamination from penetration through to the wearer's nose and mouth. (See Best Cloth Masks You Can Buy for our review of masks for sale that appear to meet the WHO requirements) Note that polypropylene, a material often used to make disposable surgical masks, has an electrostatic charge which can improve the filtration efficiency of masks. Polypropylene \"spunbound\" is sold in fabric and many other retail and online stores under brand names such as Oly*fun and Pellon. Polypropylene is sold in different weights (measured in grams per square meter or GSM). Most commercially manufactured surgical masks are made of 3-ply 25GSM. Polypropylene materials between 25 and 40 GSM tend to have similar filtration efficacy and breathability, while polypropylene 60 GSM has a higher filtration efficiency but less breathability (Zhao, Nano Lett 2020). Be aware that some forms of polypropylene should not be machine washed. See below for a more detailed discussion of the filtration efficacy of various cotton and synthetic household fabrics. Note that Health Canada (the Canadian equivalent of the U.S. FDA) has advised against using face masks labeled as containing graphene (or biomass graphene) due to concerns that graphene particles might be inhaled (Health Canada April 2, 2021). Graphene is promoted for use in some masks as having antibacterial and antiviral properties. Preliminary research suggests that graphene particles may cause early lung toxicity in animals, but the agency noted that the \"potential for people to inhale graphene particles from face masks and the related health risks are not yet known, and may vary based on mask design.\" Health Canada has asked distributors in Canada to stop selling graphene masks while it investigates the safety of using graphene in masks, and advised that people who have used graphene face masks and \"have health concerns, or symptoms such as new or unexplained shortness of breath, discomfort or difficulty breathing,\" to consult with their healthcare provider. For examples of graphene masks sold in the U.S., sign in and read the full answer. Standards for masks ASTM International, a non-profit organization that sets standards for medical masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE), has published voluntary standards for non-medical cloth face masks. Masks labeled \"Meets ASTM F3502\" must be shown, in an accredited laboratory, to meet one of two designations that will also appear on the mask label: Level 1: Particle filtration efficiency of at least 20% and airflow resistance of < 15 mm H2O Level 2: Particle filtration efficiency of at least 50% and airflow resistance of < 5 mm HH 2 O (For comparison, a NIOSH approved N95 must have an airflow resistance of no more than 35 mm H 2 O). Masks that claim to meet ASTM standards are also required to provide user instructions for size proper selection, proper use, and cleaning or disposal instructions. How cotton and other household fabrics compare in blocking coronavirusdish cloth (85% polyester and 15% nylon) was slightly better -- 97.9%. In addition, most household fabrics were more breathable than the material in a medical mask. The dish cloth, for example, was twice as breathable as the medical mask (Aydin, medRxiv 2020 --preprint). (See the CDC website to learn how to make a cloth face covering.) Tightly woven cotton, combined with silk or chiffon A study at the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory found that tightly woven, high-thread count cotton (600 thread-per-inch (TPI) sheet by Wamsutta) was more effective in filtering large droplets (similar to larger-sized SARS-CoV-2 droplets) than loosely woven cotton with a lower thread count (quilters cotton, 80 TPI), while fabrics with an electrostatic charge (such as silk and chiffon) were best for blocking aerosols -- the smaller sized droplets that remain suspended in air for extended amounts of time. Using layers of both fabrics, together, was most effective for blocking both large and small droplets. For example, two layers of 600 TPI cotton fabric had a large particle and small particle blocking efficacy of 99.5% and 82%, respectively, but one layer of 600 TPI cotton combined with two layers of chiffon (90% polyester, 10% spandex from Jo-Ann Stores) had a large particle and small particle blocking efficacy of 99.2% and 97% -- which, at low airflow rates (i.e., when not all air is drawn through the mask) is nearly as good as a properly-fitted N95 mask for blocking large particles and better than the N-95 with respect to small particles, of which only 85% are blocked by an N-95 mask). However, as emphasized in a published correction to the study, it is not known how efficient this fabric combination will be at normal or high rates of airflow when made into a fitted mask, i.e., when there are no leaks and all air flows directly through the mask, particularly when one is engaged in high levels of exertion. The researchers also found that small holes or leaks around the edges of the fabrics could decrease the blocking efficacy by 50% or more, and emphasized the importance of a good fit (snug and without gaps) (Konda, ACS Nano 2020). [Note: An illustration in the study shows the electrostatic layer of fabric as the inner layer when fabrics were combined. However, ConsumerLab contacted the author of the study who suggested that electrostatic fabric (such as chiffon) may be best used as the outer layer of the mask to avoid humidity from the nose or mouth, which could interfere with the electrostatic properties, but emphasized that was his suggestion, not something that was tested in the study.] Cotton bandanas and handkerchiefs In another study, researchers at Florida Atlantic University tested masks made from common household fabrics, as well a typical \"cone\" mask (often sold at pharmacies) to see how well they worked to stop droplets using a simulated model of coughing (a mannequin head through which liquid was manually pumped). Without any covering, droplets from the simulated cough traveled an average of 8 feet. With a bandana (single-layer, elastic T-shirt material, 85 threads per inch) droplets traveled an average of 3 ft. 7 inches, with a folded cotton handkerchief (as shown in this instructional video featuring the U.S. Surgeon General), 1 ft. 3 inches, and with a cone mask (CVS Cone Face Mask), 8 inches. The most effective mask was a stitched cotton mask (using two-layers of cotton quilting fabric, 70 threads per inch), with which droplets traveled just 2.5 inches. The researchers noted that \"healthcare professionals trained properly in the use of high-quality fitted masks will not experience leakage to the extent that we have observed in this study. However, leakage remains a likely issue for members of the general public who often rely on loose-fitting homemade masks.\" (Verma, Phys Fluids 2020). Polypropylene and surgical masks Rather than focus on how far droplets travel, researchers at Duke looked at how well different masks block droplets during speaking. A fitted N95 mask without a valve was most effective in retaining droplets, with less than 1% of droplets being transmitted. The next most effective, in order, were a 3-layer surgical mask, a cotton-polypropylene-cotton \"apron\" mask, a 2-layer polypropylene mask, a 2-layer cotton pleated mask, and then an N95 with a valve. Neck gaiters (fleece, microfiber & polyester) The Duke researchers found that two masks offered little protection: A double-layer bandana was only slightly more effective than using no face covering at all, while the worst face covering was a \"gaiter\" style neck fleece (often worn during running or sports) that showed a 10% increase in the number of droplets. The researchers suggested that the neck fleece material breaks larger liquid droplets into smaller droplets than can more easily be dispersed into the air (Fischer, Sci Adv 2020 \u2014 includes photos of the masks but no details about origin or brands). However, tests conducted by researchers at Virginia Polytechnic Institute found that, when measuring droplets that dispersed in an outward direction at a distance of about 1 ft. (30 cm), neck gaiters (one made of thin, 100% polyester (Chaos) and the other, a thicker, microfiber gaiter made of 87% polyester and 13% elastane (Cirque)) worked as well as a cloth mask (a no-sew mask made of cotton T-shirt material), blocking 100% of larger droplets (> 20 microns), 90% of droplets 5 microns in size, and 50% of 0.5 micron aerosols. They were somewhat less efficient than the cloth mask at blocking smaller aerosols, although when the thinner gaiter was doubled over, it blocked about 90% of droplets and aerosols (0.5 to 5 microns) (Pan, Virginia Tech PDF 2020). When doubled over, some neck gaiters may be more effective than a triple layer, all-cotton cloth mask. A study conducted by researchers at the CDC and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), found that a single-layer polyester neck gaiter (FKGIONG Sun UV Protection Neck Gaiter, 95% polyester, 5% Spandex) blocked 47% of outward moving cough aerosols (ranging in size from 0 to 7 microns) and when doubled over, blocked 60%. This was slightly better than a medical procedure mask with ear loops, which blocked 59% and a cloth mask made of 3 layers of cotton fabric and ear loops (Hanes Defender), which blocked 51%. An N95 respirator blocked 99% (Lindsley, medRxiv 2020 -- preprint). It should be noted that the cotton cloth mask tested did not have an outer layer made of hydrophobic material (such as polypropylene or polyester) as recommended by WHO. If wearing a neck gaiter, make sure it fits securely and consider choosing one with an adjustable cord, to help prevent it from falling down (off of the nose and mouth) during strong sudden movements, such as during a sneeze. Which masks protect you best? A study that evaluated how well masks protect the wearer from breathing in small particles (ranging in size from 0.02 to 0.6 microns) and factored in the fit of the mask as well as its filtration efficiency found that a NIOSH approved N95 (3M 9210) had the highest filtration efficiency at 98%, followed by 80% for a medical procedure mask with ear loops (Cardinal Health) with nylon hosiery placed over it, and 71.5% for a surgical mask with ties. [Note: The filtration efficiency of the medical procedure masks can range dramatically depending on how it was worn.] The filtration efficiency was 74% for a 2-layer woven nylon mask with ear loops (Easy Masks LLC) with an aluminum nose bridge and nonwoven filter insert which, interestingly, had a slightly higher filtration efficiency after being washed once, 49.9% for a folded, cotton bandana, 39.3% for a single-layer woven polyester\/nylon mask with ties (Renfro Corporation), 37.8% for a single-layer woven gaiter\/neck cover balaclava bandana MPUSA LLC), 28.6% for a nonwoven polypropylene mask with fixed ear loops (Red Devil Inc), and just 26.5% for a 3-layer woven cotton mask (100% cotton) with ear loops (Hanesbrands Inc) (Clapp, JAMA Intern Med 2020). Best Materials for Making Your Own Mask Filter As discussed above, the WHO recommends that the middle layer of a cloth mask be made of a synthetic, nonwoven fabric such as polypropylene, or a second layer of cotton (high thread count cotton has been shown to have better filtration efficacy than lower-thread cotton). Many cloth masks that you can buy online come with a \"filter pocket\" as the middle layer, which you can buy pre-made filters for, or add your own. We've reviewed common materials for making mask filters, including Filti Face Mask Material and Medline Dry Baby Wipes, as well as materials such as polypropylene and other non woven fabrics (100% polypropylene, Pellon Sew-In Interfacing and Oly*fun), cotton and quilter's cotton.

How Cloth, N95, KN95 and other Masks Compare As noted above, well-constructed cloth masks may reduce your risk of exposure to virus-containing particles, but their main purpose is to help protect others from potentially infectious particles that you may emit. They generally do not provide the same level of protection to the wearer as N95 or KN95 respirators. The extent to which cloth masks can filter particles (filtration efficiency) can vary widely depending on the type of fabrics used, the number of layers, and the fit. Cloth masks are also not held to the same standards as N95 and KN95 respirators, as they do not have to be tested by a government agency or meet standardized criteria in order to be sold. If you choose a cloth mask, be sure to it meets basic CDC and WHO guidelines. You can also look for cloth masks that has been tested and shown to meet voluntary ASTM standards. A cloth mask that has received a \"Level 2\" designation has been shown to have a particulate filtration efficiency \"of at least 50%.\" In comparison, NIOSH approved particulate N95 respirators have been tested by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a division of the U.S. CDC. They must meet certain minimum criteria, including a particular filtration efficiency of at least 95%, an inhalation resistance of < 25 mm H20 and an exhalation resistance of <35 mm H20 (these are measures of how difficult is to breath in and out while wearing the respirator). Unlike cloth masks, NIOSH approved N95s are also required to attach to the head with head straps, rather than ear loops, as head straps can provide a more secure fit and reduce gapping. KN95 respirators, the Chinese \"equivalent\" of N95 respirators, must meet similar standards, including a particular filtration efficiency of at least 95%, and limits for inhalation and exhalation resistance. They are not required to have head straps (most have ear loops), although some do. Be aware that, during the pandemic, there have been many reports of counterfeit KN95s sold in the U.S., so you need to be careful where you buy KN95s. (For more about the differences between N95s and KN95s and quality concerns, see Are KN95 respirators as good as N95s?). Sign in to see CL's Reviews of Popular N95 Respirators. Best Cloth Masks You Can Buy If you prefer to purchase a cloth mask, we reviewed many masks sold online and identified several that we believe best meet WHO guidelines and\/or are constructed with materials that offer a good combination of filtration efficacy and breathability. We also considered features that can affect fit and comfort, such as adjustable\/bendable nose wires and adjustable straps, which can be particularly important for people who wear glasses or hearing aids. We also reviewed oversized masks designed to accommodate beards or to be used when singing, and masks with clear panels to enable lip reading by others. In addition, we assessed eyeglass fogging with each mask when worn in cool air. Our list starts with our overall Top Pick for quality, comfort and breathability, fit, and minimal eyeglass fogging. This is followed by our next favorites, as well as masks for those who need clear panels. In our review of masks, we considered those from Allet, Atelier, Giftington, Graf Lanzt, LA Linen, Proper Cloth, Rafi Nova, Stark's, Tom Bihn, Vertex, Vida, Vistaprint, and masks sold on Etsy. Be aware that there is a shipping fee for most masks, calculated before check out based on location and\/or other factors. Most companies provide an estimated time for the product to ship, but delivery time will depend on the shipping option you choose. ConsumerLab.com derives no revenue from sales of these products. (To see our list of the best cloth masks you can buy, sign in. If you are not a ConsumerLab member, join now.) How to reduce air leakage around a mask Air leakage around a mask reduces the level of protection it provides you and those around you. There are several ways to reduce air leakage, as discussed below. Also be aware that if you are infectious, the area of your face beyond a leak, including eyeglasses, may become contaminated due to exhaled droplets, as demonstrated in OSHA study (Stephenson, medRxiv 2021 -- preprint). Knotting ear loops The fit and filtration efficiency of medical procedure masks with ear loops can be significantly improved by knotting the ear loops and then tucking in and flattening the extra material close to the face (see illustration), according to research conducted on manikins by the CDC. This was shown to reduce exposure to aerosols from a cough by 64.5%. Double masking Wearing a medical mask (i.e., a blue \"procedure\" mask) under a cloth mask improves protection, (likely by minimizing leaks between the medical mask and skin), but wearing a medical mask over a cloth mask has less benefit. A study found that wearing a medical mask under a cloth mask increased the filtration efficiency of cloth masks (which, alone, were 41 to 44% efficient), as well as medical masks (which, alone, were 43 to 62% efficient). Adding a medical mask beneath a cloth mask increased fitted filtration efficiencies to 66% for a simple cotton ear-loop mask, 77% for a cotton bandana, and 81% for a gaiter. Doubling a medical mask was not as effective, nor was doubling cloth masks \u2014 which also reduced breathability (Sickbert-Bennett, JAMA Intern Med 2021). Nose wires Be aware that, while adding a nose wire to masks can improve their fit (and therefore, possibly reduce air leakage and improve protection). They seem to be of benefit with stiffer masks but; but not with masks made with stretchy or more flexible material (O'Kelly, medRxiv 2021 -- preprint). Try not to bend over while wearing a mask Researchers at Columbia University who were fit testing N95 respirators found that normal breathing and talking did not negatively affect mask fit, and turning the head from side to side slightly improved fit (perhaps due to tightening). However, moving the head up and down slightly worsened fit, and bending over decreased proper fit by as much as 50%. The researchers suggested kneeling rather than bending over when wearing a mask (Chen, medRxiv 2020 -- preprint). Mask fitters Masks fitters are a \"frame\" that can be placed over masks to improve the fit and \"seal\" of the mask against the face to reduce air leakage and increase inhalation filtration efficiency. Using mannequins that could \"breathe,\" researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that placing either of two marketed mask fitters over a variety of masks increased inhalation filtration efficiencies from just 7% without the fitter to 26% for a 4-ply cotton mask, from 52% to 63% for a 3-ply spunbond polypropylene mask, from 44% to 91% for a surgical mask, and from only 18% up to as much as 95% for a 3-ply disposable non-medical mask with a melt-blown polypropylene center. Sign in to learn make a mask fitter at home or buy either of the two used in the study. Nylon stockings Another way to reduce air leaks was suggested by a study at Northeastern University in Boston, which showed that pulling an 8 to 10-inch tube of nylon (cut from a queen-sized nylon stocking) down over a regular mask and to the top of the neck. This significantly prevented air leakage around the mask and improved particle filtration efficiency, making the combined masking nearly as effective as an N-95 respirator which, unlike a medical mask, has an electrostatic charge and is specifically designed to prevent air leakage (Mueller, medRxiv 2020 --preprint; Godoy, NPR.org 4\/22\/20). Similarly, a study found that adding a sleeve of nylon hosiery over a medical procedural mask with ear loops (Cardinal Health Inc) increased its overall filtration efficiency from just 38.5% to 80%. Other techniques that created a better fit for the procedure mask to reduce air leakage included tying the ear loops and tucking in the side pleats (see video demonstration), which increased filtration efficiency to 60.3%, or securing the ear loops with ear guards (61.7%), a hair clip (64.8%) or placing three rubber bands across the front of the mask and looped on the ears (78.2%) (Clapp, JAMA Intern Med 2020). How to reduce eyeglass fogging from masks Our tests indicated that eyeglasses were less likely to fog in cool air with masks that 1) came up higher on the nose and cheeks (allowing glasses to sit over the edge of the mask 2) had a bendable top frame that could be contoured for a close fit around the nose and cheeks, 3) had adjustable ear or head bands, allowing the mask to be tight against the face, and 4) had an outer layer of 100% polyester or chiffon rather than a cotton or cotton\/polyester blend. Find out which masks had the least fogging. Lens fogging may also be minimized by rinsing lenses with highly diluted liquid soap and then air drying (stand lenses up so excess drips off) (Hu, J Emerg Nurs 2020). This leaves a surfactant film that reduces surface tension and causes water molecules to spread out evenly into a transparent layer, reducing fogging (Margrain, Ann R Coll Surg Engl 2011). Anti-fogging sprays and wipes are also sold, but be sure to follow directions and allow liquids to dry before wearing to avoid eye irritation or injury from the liquid. (A CL member reported severe eye irritation after using JAWS Spit Gel which seems to have gotten into his eye after a COVID nasal test that caused eye tearing) (Peng, Cornea 2006). Eye injury has also been reported in healthcare workers in China who used anti-fog spray on medical goggles (Hu, J Emerg Nurs 2020). Single-sided and double-sided tape strips can also be used to seal the edges of masks around the eyes and nose to reduce fogging. ConsumerLab purchased two tape strip products sold on Amazon, MaskTite Adhesive Strips and Cabeau Tape. We tried each with the masks in this review, and with a disposable mask, while wearing glasses. [Sign in to see our reviews of these tapes and our mask reviews.] How to clean a cloth mask The CDC advises that cloth masks be washed daily (and after high exposure) with soap and water. The agency also suggests each person have at least two cloth masks, likely so that one can be used while the other is being cleaned. It notes that \"cloth can be used for an extended period as long as they are not wet or soiled, but do not reuse them unless washed and cleaned.\" Masks should not be worn while still wet, as the agency states that the filtration effectiveness may be reduced. The FDA recommends choosing a cloth mask that can be washed and machine dried without damage or change in shape. Cloth masks can be washed in a washing machine. They can also be cleaned using heat, but a washing machine is preferred. Silk and chiffon fabrics may need to be hand washed with cold water. If you've purchased a mask, check with the fabric manufacturer or see the care instructions on the label. If hand washing is required, be sure to use adequate soap\/detergent and rinse thoroughly, as soap helps to break down the lipid layer that allows SARS-Cov-2 to attach to surfaces. Some sturdier silk and chiffon blends, such as poly-spandex-chiffon, can be machine washed with warm water and tumbled dry if placed in a mesh bag for delicates. Re-using N95s? Currently, the CDC recommends re-using a single N95 respirator no more than five times. It also advises healthcare workers \"wear one N95 FFR each day and store it in a breathable paper bag at the end of each shift with a minimum of five days between each N95 FFR use, rotating the use each day between N95 FFRs,\" noting that this \"will provide some time for pathogens on it to \"die off\" during storage.\" A study of 3M N95 respirators (dome-shaped duckbill models) worn by healthcare workers at Johns Hopkins Hospital caring for COVID-19 patients found that all N95s worn less than 12 times (and stored between uses) passed seal check and fit testing. Even when used about 40 times, 83% still passed these tests. The study implied that the masks had not been subject to decontamination procedures but they may have been somewhat protected from pathogen contamination as they were typically worn with face shields (Fabre, medRxiv 2020 -- preprint). Preventing mask-related skin irritation and acne Keeping masks clean can also help prevent skin irritation, acne, and other skin conditions that can be caused by or exacerbated by wearing a mask, including eczema (contact dermatitis), rosacea, and folliculitis (inflammation\/infection of hair follicles). Although the term \"maskne\" has become a common term to describe skin irritation and eruptions after wearing masks, contact dermatitis appears to be the most common skin irritation associated with wearing masks. All of these conditions can be aggravated by humidity within the mask, increased bacterial load on the skin, and friction from mask material. In addition to replacing and\/or cleaning masks regularly, dermatologists recommend applying light moisturizer 30 minutes before putting on your mask and maintaining good oral hygiene to help minimize the risk of skin irritation. You can find more information and the full list of tips for skin care when wearing masks in this article (see \"General measures to prevent PPE related facial dermatoses\") (Rud, BMJ 2021). Effect on breathing function and potential carbon dioxide buildup When wearing an N95 respirator or a well-fitted mask with high blocking efficiency there can be some carbon dioxide buildup inside the mask over time (Sinkule, Ann Occup Hyg 2013). According to researchers at Stanford University, N95 masks are \"are estimated to reduce oxygen intake by anywhere from 5 to 20 percent. That's significant, even for a healthy person. It can cause dizziness and lightheadedness.\" However, a small study in the U.S. found that wearing an N-95 mask for up to one hour did not cause any significant adverse effects in healthy healthcare workers performing moderate activities, despite significantly decreased inhaled oxygen and increased inhaled carbon dioxide levels (Roberge, Respir Care 2010). A representative from the CDC told Reuters.com that \"...the level of CO2 likely to build up in the mask is mostly tolerable to people exposed to it. You might get a headache but you most likely [would] not suffer the symptoms observed at much higher levels of CO2. The mask can become uncomfortable for a variety of reasons including a sensitivity to CO2 and the person will be motivated to remove the mask. It is unlikely that wearing a mask will cause hypercapnia [elevated blood levels of carbon dioxide].\" On the other hand, surgical masks (also known as medical masks), which are inherently not as well-fitting as N95 respirators, do not lead to CO2 intoxication or oxygen deficiency, as noted by the World Health Organization. Several studies have demonstrated this. For example, a study among 20 healthy adults showed that moderate exercise (walking on a treadmill) for one hour while wearing a surgical mask led to only slight, clinically non-significant changes in CO2 levels (as measured on the skin) compared to exercise without a mask (Respir Physiol Neurobiol 2012). Even during vigorous exercise (cycling to exhaustion, an average of about 10 minutes) a study among 14 healthy men and women showed that wearing a disposable surgical mask or a three-layer cloth mask (Washable 3D Face Mask, TriMax Sports Inc. \u2014 made with bamboo charcoal cloth, non-woven fabric, and Lycra) had no effect on blood or muscle oxygenation or exercise performance compared exercising without a mask (Shaw, Int J Environ Res Public Health 2020). Furthermore, a study of 10 healthcare workers (including individuals with controlled asthma and four smokers), found that wearing a surgical mask (AFLUID, made of three layers of polypropylene and one layer of liquid resistant polyethylene) continuously for four hours did not reduce breathing function (Ciocan, Med Lav 2020). Additionally, older adults who wore a three-layer disposable nonmedical face mask with ear loops (Boomcare DY95 model, Deyce Leather Co Ltd) for one hour showed no decline in self-reported blood oxygen levels (as measured by pulse oximeter) (Chan, JAMA 2020). Another study showed that, even among older adults (average age 71) with breathing difficulty due to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), wearing a surgical mask during a six-minute walk test did not result in any major changes in CO2 retention (Samannan, Ann Am Thorac Soc 2020). The researchers suggested that discomfort while wearing a surgical mask might be caused by the increased warmth of facial skin and inhaled air inside the mask, which may trigger sensations of anxiety or claustrophobia in some people. The CDC advises that face masks should not be placed on children under the age of two, anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone who would not be able to remove the mask without assistance. Inhalation of microplastics and OPEs Concern has been raised about the risk of inhaling microplastic particles when wearing a mask made of polypropylene or other materials containing plastics. A study in China found that most masks increased the inhalation of fiber-like microplastics but notably decreased the risk of inhalation of spherical particles. While some evidence has suggested that fiber-like microplastics may be more toxic to animals than spherical microplastics (Ziajahromi, Environ Sci Technol 2017), the investigators concluded that, overall, inhalation of microplastics from masks is a small problem compared to the risk of spreading COVID-19 without a mask, as people already regularly inhale high amounts of microplastics from the air, with or without a face mask. The study found that only N95 respirators reduced the risk of inhaling fiber-like microplastic particles compared to not wearing a mask, while a nonwoven mask, a fashion mask, and a cotton mask increased it by 17%, 41%, and 54%, respectively, surgical masks increased it by about 4% to 73%, and activated charcoal mask increased it by 117%. Inhalation of spherical microplastic particles was reduced by about 47% to 96% for all masks compared to not wearing a mask. Disinfecting any of the masks with UV irradiation, alcohol, air blower treatment, washing with soap and water, or exposure to sunlight increased the microplastic inhalation risk compared to untreated masks, although the risk was only small following washing with water and was lowest following exposure to sunlight. Alcohol disinfection increased the risk of microplastic inhalation most significantly (Li J Hazard Mater 2020). Polypropylene and other plastic materials used to make KN95 respirators, medical, surgical and other types of masks are often treated with organophosphate esters (OPEs) which, at high concentrations and with prolonged exposure to OPEs through ingestion, inhalation, or skin contact have been linked with cancer and other adverse effects. Sign in to the full answer to see what researchers found when they looked at the risk of inhaling OPEs when wearing masks. Are KN95 respirators as good as N95s? N95 and KN95 masks (or, more technically, respirators) are designed to protect you, as well as others around you. Both are supposed to filter 95% of particles down to 0.3 microns. However, as discussed below, this isn't always the case with widely sold KN95 masks (which are designed to meet Chinese, rather than U.S. specifications). In addition, while N95 respirators attach with head bands to help ensure the best fit, most KN95s attach with ear loops, which may cause a loose or improper fit, and allow for air leakage. A study of N95 and KN95 respirators have shown that mask performance depends, in part, on the tightness of the contact between the material and the facial skin and masks that tied around the head outperform those with elastic ear loops (Sickbert-Bennett, JAMA Intern Med 2020). As discussed above, how you move while wearing a mask may also affect fit. Nevertheless, due to the previous shortage of N95 masks, in April 2020 the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) provided guidance that KN95 masks certified to China's GB2636 standards of 2006 or 2019 (imprinted on masks as \"GB2626-2006\" or \"GB2626-2019\") \"will provide greater protection than surgical masks (i.e., facemasks, other than surgical N95s[3]), homemade masks, or improvised mouth and nose covers, such as bandanas and scarves.\" Caution: You should not buy a KN95 mask that does not have its GB2626-2006 or GB2626-2019 imprinted on it. Tests of KN95s from China by the CDC show that the filtration efficacy of some KN95 masks is 95% or higher but can be as low as 5.3%. Furthermore, tests by ECRI, an independent, U.S. based non-profit organization that evaluates equipment for hospitals and healthcare systems, showed that 5 of 11 KN95s did not meet the filtration efficiency standard of 95%. ECRI also found large variations in filtration efficiencies of KN95s within the same lot from a single manufacturer, suggesting quality control issues. (You can download ECRI's test results, which includes manufacturer information and photos of the respirators tested by clicking on \"PPE Testing Report\" on this page on ECRI's site). Buying a KN95 Starting in 2020, the FDA published and maintained a list of N-95 and KN95 respirators from China given emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA during the pandemic. However, as of July 6, 2021, due to the increased supply and availability of NIOSH-approved respirators, the FDA has revoked its authorization of non-NIOSH approved respirators manufactured in China for healthcare workers. Respirators with previous EUA status may still be marketed to the general public, but must be labeled as face masks, rather than respirators. Update: On August 25, 2021, the FDA announced that federal approval of respirators made by particular manufacturer has been revoked due to concerns about the quality of the products. Sign in for the details. Finding the Best KN95 Mask N95 masks are currently very hard to find and purchase as they remain reserved for healthcare and frontline workers. In contrast, KN95 masks are widely available for purchase on websites such as Amazon. However, it can be very difficult to know if a KN95 mask is genuine and effective. We reviewed many KN95 masks sold on Amazon but found only one currently on the FDA's list of authorized respirators that we recommend, and we found two that should be avoided. We also found an FDA-authorized KN95 through an online direct distributor in the U.S. The CDC publishes a list and images of dozens of counterfeit and falsely marketed respirators. Signs of a counterfeit respirator include no approval number or NIOSH markings, decorative fabrics or add-ons, and claims of being approved for children. Other respirators Before N95 respirators became more available, the United States Department of Labor, noted that healthcare workers who were unable to obtain N95 respirators could use R95, R99, P95, P99, P100 and others respirators. Like N95 masks, these are expected to filter out a minimum of 95% of particles of the most penetrating size, and those ending in a \"99\" or \"100\" filter out at least 99% or 99.97%, respectively, of such particles but can be more difficult to breathe through. R95 and P95 masks are typically used for protection when working with oil-based substances like fuel, paints, solvents, or pesticides. N95s are not resistant to oil, R95s are \"somewhat resistant\" and P95s are \"strongly resistant to oil or oil proof,\" as shown in the CDC's infographic about these types of masks. If considering an alternative respirator, make sure it is NIOSH approved. Respirators with exhalation valves should not be used when trying to protect others. (See a video demonstration by researchers at Florida Atlantic University of how aerosols can spread when coughing while wearing an N95 mask with a valve). KF94 respirators from Korea are often promoted as the Korean \"equivalent\" to N95 respirators, but this is not quite accurate. Although they can have relatively high filtration efficacy, KF94 masks are considered \"public use\" respirators and are not held to the same performance standards as Korea's Special 1st class \"occupational use\" respirators (which are considered to be roughly equivalent to NIOSH approved N95 masks). KF94 respirators are designed to have a filtration efficacy of 94%, and CDC tests of one brand of KF94 found its filtration efficacy to be even higher (99.85 to 99.94%). However, unlike all NIOSH-approved N95s (which attach with head bands), KF94 respirators attach with ear loops, which, the CDC points out, may compromise their fit and efficacy. The CDC did not perform fit testing on the KF94s it tested and noted a lack of information about manufacturing quality control. In addition, unlike surgical N95 respirators, KF94 respirators are not considered fluid resistant (Kim, J Korean Med Sci 2020). Electrical air purifying respirators that mimic powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) are available on Amazon, ranging in price from about $60 to $100, but these devices would not be suitable for preventing the spread of COVID-19 among the general public. These devices include a portable high efficiency (HE) filter that can be connected to a face mask via a flexible hose\/air duct to supply fresh air to the wearer. By ventilating air from the HE filter to the mask, these devices should create positive air pressure. This means that air exhaled by the wearer would leak out of the mask. Consequently, these devices might protect the wearer if the ventilation is strong enough, but they would not protect individuals nearby the wearer. Furthermore, unlike NIOSH-certified PAPRs, which are rated as being more effective than N-95 masks, available electrical air purifying respirators do not appear to be certified. Therefore, it is uncertain if these devices even help protect the wearer. In addition, similar to other personal (\"wearable\") air purifiers, these devices might not be permitted on airplanes, as security officers can confiscate these devices if they feel they are unsafe or cause a threat. Are copper masks better? Copper has been shown to inactivate a wide variety of bacteria and some viruses, typically within minutes to hours of contact, and a study found that SARS-CoV-2 (at about 72\u00b0F and 40% relative humidity) was undetectable on copper after four hours (van Dormalen, NEJM (correspondence) 2020). There do not appear to be studies showing how effective masks made with copper or copper infused fabric are against SARS-Cov-2. However, preliminary research with other viruses suggests a possible benefit. A study funded by the maker of copper masks (Cupron) for healthcare and institutional use, showed that an N95 mask with two added layers of copper oxide infused material (polypropylene fabric containing 2.2% weight\/weight copper particles) had a similar filtering efficacy as a regular N95 mask, but was much more effective in inactivating human influenza A virus (H1N1) and avian influenza virus (H9N2) (Barkow, PLoS One 2010). A University of Massachusetts Amherst microbiologist developed a reusable mask made of 99.95% pure copper mesh, which, according to a university news release, was shown to \"kill 90% of microbes within five minutes of contact.\" In Hong Kong, the government is distributing fabric masks to the public that contain copper, known as the CuMask+ (Parry, BMJ 2020). According to the manufacturer, CuMask+ is made up six layers, \"two of which are specially made with small quantities of copper.\" Tests published by the company suggest it retains antiviral activity with up to 60 washes (handwashed with soap and cold water). If you use a copper-containing mask, be sure to clean it regularly and according to the product instructions: Bacteria and viruses can cling to dirt or other particles on copper, making it less effective (Grass, Appl Environ Microbiol 2011). Some concerns have been raised about the safety of copper masks and the possibility of breathing in copper particles. While we don't have safety information for specific products, laboratory studies that measured the amount of copper released from copper oxide impregnated masks during 5 hours under simulated breathing conditions was far below the respiratory copper permissible exposure limit (PEL) set by the USA Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") (Borkow, Curr Chem Biol 2012). How to protect yourself from COVID-19 in a car Preliminary research suggests that viral loads can quickly build up within a closed car, even during rides as brief as 15 minutes. Wearing a mask, as well as a face shield, are good first steps to help protect yourself and others. When there are two people in a car (one driver and one passenger) seating the passenger in the back seat on the opposite side of the driver creates the most distance between them. To increase ventilation, computer modeling research shows that riding with all windows down is most effective. Since this isn't always practical, the next most effective way to increase ventilation is by opening one window in the back and one in the front, opposite of where the occupants sit, creating airflow across the interior of the car. Keeping all the windows closed and running the air-conditioning, is least effective (Mathai, Sci Adv 2020). Keep in mind that none of these steps eliminate the risk of infection. How to improve safety for bus passengers and drivers A study of aerosol flow on a school bus and transit bus that were driven under real-world conditions showed that mask wearing and ventilation can significantly reduce exposure to aerosols for passengers (Edwards, medRxiv 2021 -- preprint). Based on their experiments, the researchers recommended the following tips to help reduce exposure to aerosols for bus passengers: Require all passengers and drivers to wear masks on buses. Even a cloth mask that's 50% efficient can reduce particles released from a cough by 50% and reduce their dispersal by several feet. Open windows partially or fully. This can reduce airborne particles by 50% to 80%. Consider seating arrangements that only allow for same household or same cohort passengers to sit together. Social distancing of six feet is not practical on most buses, but any extra distance allows the air movement to reduce exposure to infectious particles. For bus drivers, the researchers recommended risk could be reduced by using a dashboard fan to create airflow in the driver seat area. They also noted that, when safe to do so, opening all transit bus doors at every stop would allow for better air exchange. What masks protect against wildfire smoke? Cloth masks, including those with sewn-in or removable filters, should not be relied on for protection from wildfire smoke, according to the CDC. They protect against some of the larger particles in wildfire smoke, but not from smaller particles in smoke that can damage the lungs. In addition, one-strap paper dust masks and surgical masks, worn alone, are not recommended for wildfire smoke protection. It is recommended that people who have to be outdoors in wildfire affected areas wear fit-tested, NIOSH-approved N95 or P100 respirators, and the CDC notes that properly fitted N95 respirators can \"provide protection from wildfire smoke and from COVID-19 for the individuals wearing them.\" To help prevent the spread of COVID-19 to others, N95 masks without valves are recommended. If an N95 mask with a valve is your only option for wildfire smoke protection, consider covering the valve with tape or wearing a surgical mask over the N95 when around others, as recommended by John Balms, M.D. at UCSF. According to the CDC, KN95 respirators can also provide protection from wildfire smoke, and advises looking for a KN95 that meets requirements similar to those set by the CDC's NIOSH (see our Top Pick among KN95 masks, which was tested by the CDC).",

        "text":"To assist leaders in government, academic, the private sector and others who depend on the physical sciences as they craft specific recommendations to address the COVID-19 pandemic's impacts, the American Institute of Physics convened a panel of experts to forecast the effects on the physical sciences. The panel that produced this report is composed of nine experts who bring scientific, institutional, experiential, and other dimensions of diversity to this task. Over the course of six weeks, from May to June 2020, the panel focused on the actual and potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical sciences enterprise as a first step in envisioning a post-pandemic recovery strategy. This report discusses the pandemic's current and expected impacts on the physical sciences enterprise in three dimensions: workforce, infrastructure, and the conduct of research. Download the full report Executive Summary As with much of America and the world, the conduct of the physical sciences\u2014physics, chemistry, Earth science, astronomy, and related fields\u2014has been severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The shutdown of most activities has stalled research, particularly in the laboratory and field sciences, which generally require in-person interactions and logistical support. The operation of major facilities and international travel have been largely curtailed, and universities are being challenged as never before. Perhaps the largest impact has been on students and early-career scientists, especially those from underrepresented groups. On the positive side, the pandemic has opened up opportunities to convene scientists in new ways, making use of new technologies that shrink distances and enable new forms of interpersonal interaction across miles. Social distancing and other pandemic countermeasures, such as virtual meetings, have illuminated the increasing interconnectedness of the sciences, the important roles played by each field of science, as well as the challenges and opportunities associated with new ways of connecting scientists. The physical sciences have long contributed to the nation\u2019s prosperity and well-being through advancements in, and contributions to, fields from biotechnology to quantum science, from aerospace engineering to renewable energy, and from numerical weather prediction to emergency response. Yet as we survey the pandemic\u2019s impacts, the American physical sciences may be at a tipping point. If we take swift action to define and defend a vibrant future for science in the United States as we rebuild and renew after the pandemic, we can bring new strength, resiliency, and diversity to the physical sciences community to the benefit of our economy and society for decades. If we do not act on this promise of new opportunity, we are in peril of losing the resilient and robust physical sciences enterprise America needs to remain healthy, innovative, and prosperous. The physical scientists and engineers that are helping the nation begin to recover stand ready to contribute further. We can emerge from the crisis stronger than ever before, but we need to recognize the more critical impacts and act now.

        "link":"https:\/\/issues.org\/resist-covid-take-6-carrie-mae-weems-fakunle-gallery\/",
        "text":"Reflections on Carrie Mae Weems\u2019s RESIST COVID | TAKE 6! I often share a Zimbabwean proverb about lion hunts: \u201cUntil the lion tells its side of the story, the tale of the hunt will always glorify the hunter.\u201d I felt the spirit of that proverb when I observed Carrie Mae Weems\u2019s RESIST COVID | TAKE 6! public awareness campaign. As an artist, Weems has long used her work to investigate family relationships, cultural identity, sexism, class, political systems, and the consequences of power. Through this collection of posters and billboards, initiated in 2020 and created with Pierre Loving and other artists, Weems is very intentional in the way she elevates stories about the COVID-19 pandemic that reflect the ongoing toll of historical and systemic minoritization, or marginalization of those belonging to minority groups, in the United States and globally. Through images that simultaneously command our attention and cultivate intimacy, Weems clearly aims to demonstrate that there is nothing inherently minor about the lives of those who identify as Black, Indigenous, or people of color. Unlike anything I have experienced in my lifetime, the pandemic has laid bare the underlying dehumanization of many lives through destructive policies, failed practices, manipulative education, and increasingly corroded quality of life. COVID-19 may have taken a million souls and permanently affected millions more, but it is part of a long history of injustice. In one artwork, Weems\u2019s loud and unapologetic call resonates far beyond the challenges of this pandemic: \u201cTHIS MUST BE CHANGED!!!\u201d And yet, in her installations, Weems reminds viewers that there remain opportunities to reconnect with our truest selves. Weems\u2019s photo of a smiling woman captures resilient optimism, and the overlaid text, \u201cLIFE IS BEAUTIFUL!!\u201d makes the declaration abundantly clear. Many of us have found beauty during the chaos of COVID-19. But like any muscle, this optimism must be constantly exercised to gain and maintain strength. COVID-19 may have taken a million souls and permanently affected millions more, but it is part of a long history of injustice. It is very easy to get swept up in the constant barrage of negativity associated with the pandemic, both organic and manufactured. But, like a mother who comforts a child in pain, Weems lets us know that it will be alright\u2014and we believe it, not just because of the messenger but also because of the message. This is what I love about arts and culture: the immense power that a simple statement can convey, with artists expressing our collective conscience. Weems\u2019s message speaks to the best of humanity during the most challenging of moments, and it reinforces the simple steps\u2014wearing a mask, getting vaccinated, and practicing social distancing\u2014that we can all take. It teaches in the best way, both reaffirming and correcting without minimizing either in the process. In another work, she encourages gratitude toward people who have weathered some of the most terrible storms during this experience: the farmers, the postal workers, the teachers, the nannies, and other frontline laborers. It should not be lost on anyone that many of the positions she acknowledges are disproportionately filled by people of color, and that these positions are underappreciated relative to their critical roles in preserving the vitality of this country. The story of how COVID-19 has created distance, literally and figuratively, is a common narrative we all share. I take comfort in Weems\u2019s confidence that \u201cwe\u2019ll hold hands again.\u201d It is another poignant example of what this pandemic has taken away from us\u2014but something we can regain through straightforward public health practices. What greater motivation could there be than to touch and embrace those we love once again? If that opportunity remains, why would we not do everything to seize it? Weems\u2019s message speaks to the best of humanity during the most challenging of moments. Context is key to any effective effort, be it in public health or arts and culture, because it cultivates a deeper level of understanding. Here, Weems\u2019s use of buttons and church fans as conduits for her messages demonstrates the importance of social context, especially for Black people. The unique cultural meanings of the fans and buttons provide a moment for grounding and remembrance of the value of space, connection with faith, and cultivation of perspective. For those involved in health communication, these artifacts demonstrate a truth: if people cannot see themselves in the story, then neither the story nor its message will resonate. Relevance matters. Collectively, we have experienced so much loss in the past two years. The abrupt endings of so many stories make us reflect on our own, and how we want it to be told. What COVID-19 has reinforced for me is that most people want the assurance that they were acknowledged, appreciated, respected, understood, and loved. That\u2019s it. RESIST COVID | TAKE 6! makes direct allusions to the realities of the dangerous circumstances surrounding us, the solutions that lie before us, as well as the reasons why we should act\u2014community, respect, faith, holding hands, and connection with humanity within us and among us.

        "text":"\u201cCould THIS twice-daily probiotic supplement filled with gut friendly bacteria help beat Long Covid?\u201d That\u2019s the headline in the Daily Mail earlier this year, one of dozens in the media across the web promoting the miracle of probiotics. Dozens of other news outlets, from Psychology Today to Medical News Today carried the same unfiltered story. Taking a probiotic supplement, they report, could improve COVID recoveries by promoting the \u201cright mix of gut bacteria\u201d to \u201cboost the body\u2019s immune defenses\u201d. These are not new claims. Since the COVID crisis commenced more than two years, and based on a few sketchy and inconclusive studies, \u2018natural\u2019 websites have been making claims that probiotic supplements could be the magic bullet to halt or even cure COVID. According to NUTRA Ingredients, which peddles supplements \u201ca probiotic formulation could act as a complementary remedy to slow down the progression of COVID-19.\u201d Is it too good to be true? The answer is \u2018yes\u2019 but with nuance. The most recent surge in articles was sparked by a small study out of Bhatia Hospital, Mumbai that suggested \u2018Long Covid\u2019 may be dictated by the microbes in our gut and that probiotics could hold a solution. \u201cThe gut microbiome is involved in the magnitude of COVID severity \u2014 possibly via modulating host immune responses,\u201d they claimed. This represents another in a line of studies that seem to support the idea that rebalancing the bacteria in our gut may help fight long-term COVID symptoms. In December, for example, researchers at Cambridge University Hospitals (CUH) NHS Foundation Trust presented data claiming to demonstrate that \u201ctwo capsules a day containing a scientifically chosen blend of natural ingredients could help patients suffering from long COVID\u201d. Oncology consultant Prof Robert Thomas was quoted as saying, \u201cSuch a rapid improvement in the majority who had been experiencing symptoms for over eight months was clinically relevant and welcomed, especially among those more likely to have pre-existing gut dysbiosis.\u201d But most scientists and researchers are more dubious. Certainly, there is no question that our gut bacteria is linked to our health. Whether tinkering with our gut bacteria using supplements can meaningfully help address COVID, or any disease for that matter, is far more problematic.

SIGN UP Skepticism Since COVID first appeared two years, probiotic devotees have been promoting salves and supplements, claiming that they could boost your immunity and ward off the coronavirus. But the curative claims of probiotics has been met with raised eyebrows from the medical and scientific world. There is widespread evidence that gut bacteria is linked to our health\u2014it\u2019s just that probiotics have not been shown to improve it as an aid to battling COVID. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine have responded to the COVID claims with skepticism: \u201cThere is currently no evidence that taking probiotics can prevent or treat COVID-19\u201d. They encourage consumers to \u201cbeware of false claims about COVID-19 cures\u201d. Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University, was an early voice of caution, challenging probiotics as a COVID-fighting tool. As he told the BBC, the idea that pills, trendy superfoods or wellness habits can provide a shortcut to a healthy immune system is a myth. In fact, the concept of \u201cboosting\u201d your immune system doesn\u2019t hold any scientific meaning whatsoever. \u201cThe problem is that many of these claims have no grounding in evidence\u201d. This idea was viewed as a case of \u201cpseudoscientists are peddling trendy products such as kombucha and probiotics\u201d. In other words, this idea may be too good to be true for a reason. Such claims during health crises have a long history. During the Spanish flu crisis a century ago, Vick\u2019s VapoRub offered itself as special treatment along with taking laxatives. Crises breed opportunity, and sometimes snake oil salesman. Is that what\u2019s going on here? Dubious claims Certainly, many of the sites promoting probiotics do their best to make it seem their over-the counter and unregulated probiotic products are medical magic. Take one example claiming to present a \u201cNew breakthrough study in overweight adults on a weight loss program\u201d. It is clear to any objective eye that this is an advertisement with the product taking front and center and minimal information about the alleged supporting study: Other ads are a little more subtle. Headlines like \u201cShelf-stable or refrigerated: Which probiotic is better for you?\u201d or \u201c5 surprising signs you probably need a probiotic\u201d are designed to convince the reader into thinking there is scientifically useful information to back up the claims. But that\u2019s not what you find when you \u201cGo to the breakthrough study results\u201d. Instead, you are transported via hyperlinks to supplements and products along with disclaimers stating, \u201cAny products featured in this article are selected by our editors, who don\u2019t play favorites. If you buy something, we may get a cut of the sale.\u201d Many promotional websites contain information that is not only scientifically tenuous, but contrary to the latest data. One common example: articles promoting the use of probiotics to counter gut bacteria loss after a course of antibiotics. This is a popular sales pitch but, unfortunately, data such as this study from the Weismann Institute in Israel suggests this is not such a good idea. Immunologist Dr. Eran Elinav explains: The evidence for taking probiotics after antibiotics is a little murky and contradictory, but the public perception of many people and some doctors is that this is a good idea, even without substantial medical evidence. Contrary to the current dogma that probiotics are harmless and benefit everyone, these results reveal a new potential adverse side effect of probiotic use with antibiotics that might even bring long-term consequences. We need to be cautious about recommending this until further knowledge emerges. To date, no probiotic has been FDA approved for clinical use, yet supplements flood the market as they remain unregulated in the US and many other countries.. \u201cMarketing of product is often geared directly at consumers without providing direct and consistent proof of effectiveness,\u201d notes the American Gastroenterological Association. So how did this latest probiotic craze gain traction? Let\u2019s review the science. The concept of utilizing probiotics as \u201cCOVID cures\u201d appears to have emerged from multiple studies that suggested the cause may lie within our digestive tract. More specifically, the ~100 trillion bacteria and microorganisms within our gut microbiome. They are a key part of our digestive system. Whenever we eat something, it needs to be broken down so that the nutrients can be absorbed and processed by our body. We cannot do this alone. We require assistance from our gut microbes, particularly in the case of complex carbohydrates and fibers. The bacteria in our gut breakdown and ferment these components and release products that can be utilized by our body. The gut microbiome has been linked to many chronic illnesses in the past but the actual impact it has is often debated and data can be tenuous at best. Now, a new set of claims that \u201ctaking a capsule of probiotics, which are designed to boost the number of beneficial bacteria in the gut, may speed up recovery from the coronavirus\u201d are gaining traction. This is further fueled by an initial study from The Chinese University of Hong Kong that reported an increased presence of harmful and pathogenic bacteria in COVID patients with severe\/long-term illness. When paired with the depletion of immune-boosting gut bacteria, the reports suggest that the gut microbial changes could directly relate to an increased risk of developing long-COVID. This has led to some concluding that probiotic supplements could be a way to protect against or treat long term complications of COVID-19 by rebalancing such changes in our gut microbes. Prof Siew NG, head of the study, concluded: The most surprising findings were that different bacteria patterns were associated with different categories of Long Covid symptoms such as respiratory, neurological, gastrointestinal, hair loss, etc. Such patterns were characterized by a higher level of \u201cunfriendly\u201d microbes and lower levels of \u201cfriendly\u201d microbes. It sounds promising but suggestive news based on incomplete research should always be approached with a considerable caution. First, COVID pathology is complex. It involves a cascade of immune events that can trigger serious consequences in a number of areas of the body. In the words of John Wherry, director of the Penn Medicine Immune Health Institute, \u201cCOVID is deranging the immune system\u201d. Second, and more importantly, we should be wary of studies that play into the billion-dollar probiotic industry narrative that untested products hold the \u2018silver bullet\u2019 for complex healthcare issue. According to the Mayo Clinic online, \u201cthere is no clear evidence that probiotics are beneficial,\u201d let alone a potential silver bullet to treat COVID. For the most part, probiotic supplements have no measurable impact on your gut microbiome diversity and may actually cause harm in some instances. Dr Matthew Ciorba, a gastroenterologist at Washington University in St. Louis, echoes this message, saying, \u201cThere is no evidence to suggest that people with normal gastrointestinal tracts can benefit from taking probiotics.\u201d Many supplement suppliers claim their products \u201coptimize your gut.\u201d That\u2019s mumbo jumbo. The average probiotic supplement contains ~2 billion bacteria. That sounds like a lot but when you consider those 2 billion will only account for 0.002% of the 100 trillion microorganisms in your gut, it\u2019s a bit like dropping a salt particle into a gallon of maple syrup and expecting it to taste salty. The impact will be minimal to non-existent in all but a few specific cases of digestive issues. \u201cEveryone else can save their money, because there\u2019s no evidence that probiotic supplements offer any benefit to already healthy people,\u201d says Prof Jack Gilbert, founder of the American Gut Project. Beyond the hype So why does the hype around a probiotic COVID cure persist? Greed and bad reporting, for the most part. It is often generated by cherry picking of data by websites seeking to promote sales of supplements. Many of the probiotic websites are trying to leverage fear generated by COVID to make a sales pitch for other probiotic supplements. Once you get past the \u2018miracle COVID cure\u2019 headlines, many articles actually report more sober and less encouraging findings. One article claiming probiotics can treat COVID, for example, included a quote from a researcher in the field: \u201cIt is not that the use of one probiotic will reduce all the problems caused by COVID-19\u201d, with the article going on to state that \u201cthe best case for probiotic therapy has been in the treatment of diarrhea\u201d. Hardly the COVID are touted in the headline! The Daily Mail led with the claim that \u201cnow it seems our gut bacteria can also tackle COVID-19\u201d. However, further into the article, the authors of the study are quoted as being much more measured. Professor Andrew Smith (Medical Sciences) offered this measured take on his findings along with a warming about taking probiotics: The study excluded those over 60 and did not account for whether volunteers had been vaccinated or not. So, we don\u2019t know if probiotics provide any benefit to those most at risk of severe Covid. And taking probiotics may be inappropriate for those with a weakened immune system because of the potential increased risk of infection from consuming large quantities of live bacteria. But probiotics are at least harmless, right? If I want to take it as a precaution surely there is no downside to trying it? Unfortunately, that may not be the case. According to research from Eran Elinav of the Weizmann Institute of Science, taking probiotics in certain scenarios can actually cause harm: The probiotics very potently and persistently prevented the original microbiome returning to its original situation. \u2026 This was very surprising and alarming to us. This adverse effect has not been described to date. So there is a risk, however minimal, in taking probiotic supplements in the hope of avoiding complications of COVID-19. When you pair that with the lack of tangible evidence of its benefits, there is not much of a case for probiotics as preventative or acute therapy. It is very difficult to find any reputable medical professional promoting probiotics as COVID treatments. For the most part, the idea is being pushed forward by supplement pushers, diet promoters or people that will sell you a handy and expensive course to help you \u201coptimize your microbiome\u201d. Proceed with caution when articles claim you can cure disease by changing the bacteria in your gut. Especially when they claim you can start healing yourself with a convenient, over the counter probiotic pill\u2014one that your doctor would never prescribe. It\u2019s a snake oil salesman pushing miracle cures. Sam Moxon has a PhD in tissue engineering and is currently a research fellow in the field of regenerative medicine.

We\u2019ve always lived with post-infection illnesses and underappreciated their consequences. A recent article in Nature Medicine lists 15 infectious agents\u2014many of which are well-known viruses, bacteria, and parasites\u2014that can cause these \u201cpost-acute infection syndromes.\u201d \u2026 Bugs that cause post-acute-infection illnesses cost society dearly, both economically and, more importantly, in personal suffering. Vaccines may blunt their harm, but that\u2019s an empirical solution without a mechanistic explanation. The real scientific advance will be to pinpoint the molecular pathology that they share. Have these viruses found a common weakness in our immune armor? Do differences in individual immune responses to these pathogens influence whether delayed symptoms appear months or perhaps years after the acute infection\u2014or not at all?

        "text":"T Lax peer review + social media = misunderstanding science he pandemic has upended many practices, among them peer review of technical medical and scientific articles. Pre-COVID, the preprint sites bioRxiv.org (\u201cbio-archive,\u201d founded in 2013) and medRxiv (\u201cmed-archive,\u201d founded in 2019) were mainly the province of science and medical journalists, and of course researchers. Preprints are technical papers that haven\u2019t yet been peer-reviewed, a process that can take months. Preliminary screens remove outrageous claims and check for plagiarism. Until a few months into the pandemic, the warning on both sites not to report on these papers was hard to navigate to, but seasoned journalists knew to respect the conditions. With general assignment reporters suddenly covering a health care crisis that increasingly required knowledge of virology, immunology, and biotech, medRxiv and bioRxiv became great sources of news. The disclaimer was moved to the opening page: Preprints are preliminary reports of work that have not been certified by peer review. They should not be relied on to guide clinical practice or health-related behavior and should not be reported in news media as established information. The warning hasn\u2019t helped. Skipping peer review leads to confusion and the spread of misinformation, especially through the echo chamber of social media. \u201cCOVID Vaccine Preprint Study Prompts Twitter Outrage,\u201d for example, details the hoopla over a medRxiv preprint that, according to experts on the statistics used, grossly overestimates the risk of heart inflammation in male teens after taking the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

SIGN UP Clinicaltrials.gov as a crystal ball for countering COVID I still hesitate to use preprints as sources for my articles \u2013 this is my 79th on COVID. But I do indulge in looking ahead, by perusing clinicaltrials.gov. Anyone can register a clinical trial at this site \u2013 the intent to run one, as well as detailed protocols as experiments proceed through the 3 phases (safety, safety and efficacy, safety and efficacy on more people). My main interest in ongoing and upcoming COVID clinical trials is to follow the retooling of vaccines to cover new viral variants, for SARS-CoV-2 will continue to mutate and spread as long as pockets of vaccine hesitancy and refusal persist. The nucleic acid sequences that lie at the core of the vaccines must correspond to the exact ways new variants differ. That\u2019s what a team of 16 experts writing in a Viewpoint in The Lancet concluded, including the two officials who recently resigned from FDA in the wake of the too-soon presidential booster announcement: The effectiveness of boosting against the main variants now circulating and against even newer variants could be greater and longer lived if the booster vaccine antigen is devised to match the main circulating variants. There is an opportunity now to study variant-based boosters before there is widespread need for them. They then compare the situation to the yearly development of new flu vaccines. So I thought I\u2019d peruse the thousand or so entries that pop up at clinical trials.gov searching under \u201cCOVID\u201d and \u201cvaccine.\u201d It\u2019s an eclectic list. 1. The number of studies exploring old vaccines, like the old TB vaccine BCG, has dropped, as things haven\u2019t panned out. 2. Many investigations are evaluating the existing vaccines in various populations, based on geography, age, and combinations of co-morbidities, for example. 3. Several studies \u201cmix and match\u201d vaccine types (Pfizer for one, Moderna for the other, while some pit vaccines against each other, like 40,800 people in Turkey who got either an experimental inactivated vaccine (TURKOVAC) or Sinovac, an approved inactivated vaccine from China. 4. Some new studies look for unusual vaccine side effects, like in the mouth, and vaccine distribution, such as in milk. 5. Lots of texting is going on. Mebo Research\u2019s COVID-19 Back-to-Normal Study is tracking bad reactions to vaccines in 1,000 people for a year, while UCLA researchers are texting 400,000 people, urging them to get vaccinated. Ascension South East Michigan\u2019s \u201cText Message Nudges for COVID-19 Vaccination\u201d are going to 1500 health care employees, and \u201cVaccine Acceptance Intervention for Veterans\u201d is deploying \u201cmotivational interviewing\u201d for 2500 veterans. Efforts at the University of Massachusetts in Worcester and in Ontario help primary care providers fight vaccine hesitancy. 6. Some clinical trials are testing vaccines delivered to different body parts. Immunizing in the nose, throat, and\/or mouth would increase production of IgA antibodies, to complement the IgG antibodies that the approved vaccines elicit, but by themselves aren\u2019t powerful enough. CyanVac\u2019s entrant is a nasal spray that targets the viral spike, but is hooked up to a parainfluenza vaccine \u2013 a dog distemper shot. The vaccine elicits antibodies and killer T cells. I\u2019m most intrigued by a vaccine candidate from ImmunityBio. It\u2019s being tested on people who\u2019ve had their 2 Pfizer or Moderna shots, 20 participants receiving it under the tongue and another 20 under the skin. The third dose targets the spike as well as the nucleocapsid proteins that hug the virus\u2019s genetic material, and also includes an \u201cenhanced T cell stimulation domain\u201d to hike T cell production. The T cell response, only recently demonstrated for the first vaccines, is a much more telling measure of durable protection than antibody ups and downs. Leonard Sender, Chief Operating Officer of ImmunityBio, announced preliminary findings. \u201cOur U.S. data show that just a single prime subcutaneous vaccination with our COVID-19 vaccine candidate induces a 10-fold increase in T cell response\u2014equivalent to T cell responses from patients previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. The T cell responses are maintained against variants, which is critical to providing protection against this ever-changing virus.\u201d 7. Moderna and Pfizer and others have been tweaking their vaccines to cover additional viral antigens for months, since the variants began sweeping the planet. Moderna\u2019s trial of a vaccine against the B1.351 variant (South Africa) is set to conclude next August, with efforts against delta not far behind. 8. Some vaccine manufacturers are anticipating COVID becoming endemic \u2013 a constant presence everywhere. Novavax, for example, is testing it\u2019s COVID-flu combo in Australia. 9. Magical mystery trials. How about passive immunity from antibodies in horse serum? Or the \u201cuniversal anti-viral vaccine for healthy elderly adults,\u201d aka AlloStim, from Immunovative Therapies. It\u2019s an elixir of donor memory T cells to replace a person\u2019s tired ones, oozing cytokines such as gamma interferon early in viral infection. The cells protect against \u201cany future variants, strains, mutations of the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as protection from any future currently unknown newly emergent novel viruses.\u201d Wow. The failure of the entire United States to get behind the vaccine effort is going to keep COVID among us for longer than might have been, a tragic lost opportunity that I just can\u2019t wrap my head around. I think we have another two or three years until SARS-CoV-2 settles down and becomes endemic, a seasonal infection about twice as deadly as influenza. It\u2019s good to know that so many anti-COVID products are in the works. Ricki Lewis has a PhD in genetics and is a science writer and author of several human genetics books.

        "text":"Experts share tips for improving mental health as we emerge and heal from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has become a big part of our daily lives. Between news reports on it, its economic costs, and the regular updates on local cases, it can feel impossible to escape COVID-19\u2019s effects. Feelings of increased anxiety, uneasiness, and fear are far from uncommon \u2014 even when people seem to be thriving at home as they pick up new hobbies or read through their entire home libraries. If you\u2019re still feeling like it\u2019s difficult to move through your day, you\u2019re not alone. How has the pandemic affected our mental health? We\u2019re just starting to truly understand the mental health effects of the past year. \u201cEveryone is experiencing this pandemic and quarantine differently,\u201d explains Dr. Jessica Myszak, a child psychologist. \u201cAn apt description I\u2019ve heard is that we are all in the same storm, but we are in different types of boats.\u201d The mental health impact on adults What we do know is that living through a pandemic has removed many foundations we used to rely on, like a stable income, a social support system, and food security. That\u2019s why 2 in 5 U.S. adults reported difficulties with mental health issues and substance use in June 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) . Nearly 1 in 3 reported symptoms of anxiety or depression. Mental health professionals have also seen an increase in the number of people seeking professional help and therapy. Even as the pandemic passes its 1-year anniversary, approximately 1 in 5 U.S. adults still experience high levels of distress. Many people who were required to report to their workplace in person faced daily stress and fears of contracting the coronavirus in addition to financial insecurity. A poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation in April 2020 found 34% of adults in the United States were classified as \u201cessential.\u201d Among them: Almost 1 in 3 said they would have to put an unexpected $500 medical bill on a credit card or borrow money. Almost 1 in 5 said they wouldn\u2019t be able to pay it. This type of financial insecurity can add up to an often draining work environment for people who didn\u2019t have the option to work from home. Parents whose kids were (or are) learning remotely \u2014 or were home due to trouble finding day care \u2014 may have also grappled with additional concerns. \u201cThe pandemic has had a major impact on parents, particularly parents of younger children,\u201d explains Christopher Beevers, professor and director of the Institute for Mental Health Research at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cIn many cases, the parents have had to take on multiple roles \u2014 caregiver, teacher, parent \u2014 with few opportunities to take a break,\u201d he says. \u201cSimultaneously, many parents are also supposed to be working from home with their own set of deadlines and work responsibilities. This sort of multitasking is highly stressful and puts a huge burden on the family unit,\u201d Beevers says. If you\u2019re still not sure how the pandemic has affected your mental health, you can use this checklist to get some clarity. The mental health impact on children and teens It isn\u2019t just adults who have experienced mental health effects. Children\u2019s mental health may have been affected by disruptions to their schoolwork, learning, and social lives. An estimated 1.6 billion learners worldwide have been affected by school closures. This left many feeling isolated and disoriented by the lack of school routine and the difficulties that come with remote learning. \u201cFor many students, online school has been an extreme challenge due to difficulty focusing and staying on task while attending school from home,\u201d explains Kristel Roper, LMFT, LPCC. \u201cStudents with ADHD or other conditions that can make learning difficult have been even more negatively affected by the recent changes.\u201d Because of the school closures, some children with extra developmental needs have been less likely to be noticed and have their needs addressed by their teachers. Myszak explains, \u201cChildren who would be identified in school as needing additional support may not be coming to the attention of the school, so they are not getting the services they need.\u201d There\u2019s also been an increase in reported thoughts of suicide and self-harm among young adults. A recent report from Mental Health America showed an increase in these thoughts, especially among LGBTQIA+ youth. Suicide prevention If you or someone you know is considering suicide, you\u2019re not alone. Help is available right now: You can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 24 hours a day at 800-273-8255. Contact the teen-to-teen peer hotline Teen Line at 800-852-8336 or text TEEN to 839863. Not in the United States? You can find a helpline in your country with Befrienders Worldwide. How has the pandemic affected people who already have a mental health condition? If you have an existing mental health condition, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have made some symptoms worse. \u201cIndividuals with anxiety often benefit from increased structure, positive social interactions, and spending time engaging in valued activities,\u201d Roper explains. \u201cAll of these have been made much more difficult by the quarantine.\u201d In addition, physical distancing measures have made it more difficult for some people to find help when dealing with loss or substance use, as many mental health professionals and support groups moved online. According to the CDC, there was an 18.2% increase in overdose-related deaths that accelerated around the time stay-at-home orders were put in place. \u201cSome have referred to the pandemic as an \u2018accelerant\u2019 that has exposed or exacerbated many vulnerabilities in society,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cPeople who have experienced depression in the past or had mild symptoms leading into the pandemic were very likely at high risk for experiencing depression during the pandemic,\u201d he says. Tips to support your mental health through the pandemic Even as we continue to move forward, many people will be reeling and healing from the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. While time may be part of the healing equation, there\u2019s a lot you can do now to take care of your mental health. And the rise of online therapy options has made professional mental healthcare more accessible for many people. Here are a few ways to care for your mental health during the pandemic and beyond. Create a daily routine Our daily work commute and office routine were some of the first things to change with the pandemic. If you once had a strict train, mealtime, or day care pickup schedule, staying at home was a real shake-up to your daily routine. That\u2019s why it can help to create a personal daily routine. \u201cI would highly recommend creating your own structure through a routine that you follow each day,\u201d Roper says. For example, it can be helpful to wake up and eat meals at the same time. Focus on reducing stress Making time to take care of yourself can help you better handle the stressors in your life. Like a car trying to run without gas, your capacity to deal with stress may be limited if your physical and mental health are running on empty. \u201cI always recommend starting [with] the basics: eating well and exercising,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cEven just a 15- to 30-minute walk each day can help ease stress and anxiety.\u201d And if you enjoy meditation, yoga, or listening to calming music and sounds, you might schedule time to engage in these activities. Set boundaries between work and home life When you were still working in the office or on location for your job, the act of physically clocking out and heading home was a natural way to transition out of your workday. But when you\u2019re working from home, it can be tough to leave the workday behind. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a good idea to set boundaries between work time and home time. For example, you could \u201ccommute\u201d to another room in your house to work, and leave that room (and work computer) behind when you end your day. If you have a home-based job with nonspecific hours, consider setting a regular work schedule to help prevent tasks from carrying over into your personal time. This can be especially true for parents working at home with their children. \u201cBeing able to turn off the computer, silence the phone, and engage in play and fun activities will speak volumes to children seeking attention,\u201d Myszak says. \u201cShowing children you are willing to spend time with them will be much more effective than anything you would say to them.\u201d Talk with a mental health professional Many resources are available to help you manage mental health challenges during the pandemic. Online therapy is becoming more popular, and it\u2019s proving effective for people during the COVID-19 pandemic. If you\u2019re interested in finding mental health support online, here are some free online therapy and support services and 10 free mental health apps to get started. Some local and national support groups can also help free of cost. While these alternatives may not be as personalized as one-on-one therapy, it can help to talk with a community of people who\u2019ve had similar experiences. These groups may also help if you\u2019re dealing with loneliness or isolation, because they allow you to interact and talk with people digitally. Mental Health America has also created an extensive list of support groups that can help you find support if you\u2019re dealing with mental health symptoms, domestic violence, or addiction. Be kind to yourself This idea gets repeated so often that it can be hard to remember what it truly means. Practicing kindness toward yourself can mean treating yourself like you\u2019d treat a loved one when you\u2019re feeling not so great. \u201cWe can be our own worst critics,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cA little self-compassion can go a long way towards feeling better. We are all doing the best that we can under incredibly difficult circumstances.\u201d The COVID-19 vaccine\u2019s role in mental health Many people are feeling relief after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. For them, it has helped lower anxiety about contracting the virus, being hospitalized, or dying as a result of the disease. Still, many people have been skeptical of the vaccine\u2019s accelerated rollout and possible side effects. This remains a real concern among some people in the United States. \u201cFor those who are wary of the vaccine, I always recommend doing your research,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cOne of the best things you can do is ask your own trusted healthcare team. They\u2019ll be able to share their professional opinions with your specific needs in mind.\u201d You can also talk with friends and family about their experiences during the pandemic and with the vaccine. Since so much of the pandemic was marked by distancing our relationships, there\u2019s great potential for healing as we start to slowly and safely reunite. \u201cFor many, the vaccine rollout has brought with it a collective sigh of relief,\u201d Beevers says. \u201cIt has also likely been highly emotional for many as we begin to see our loved ones, friends, neighbors, and communities get the vaccine and feel, for the first time in a while, that feeling of hope.\u201d",

        "link":"https:\/\/scienceblogs.com\/sb-admin\/2020\/03\/30\/virtual-communication-during-social-distancing-how-we-change-when-we-know-were",
        "text":"Social distancing due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the threat of COVID-19 has meant online communication is more popular than ever, with even casual parenting groups discovering the previous enterprise video conferencing tool Zoom. But how will that affect communications? Have you ever met someone who is stiff in person but great on camera or the other way around? Neuroscientists study brain and behavior and in a recent study found that a person's gaze is altered during tele-communication if they think that the person on the other end of the conversation can see them. People are very sensitive to the gaze direction of others and even two-day-old infants prefer faces where the eyes are looking directly back at them. The phenomenon known as \"gaze cueing,\" a powerful signal for orienting attention, is a mechanism that likely plays a role in the developmentally and socially important wonder of \"shared\" or \"joint\" attention where a number of people attend to the same object or location. The ability to do this is what makes humans unique among primates. Throughout almost all of human history, conversations were generally conducted face-to-face, so people knew where their conversational partner was looking and vice versa. Now, with virtual communication, that assumption no longer holds - sometimes people communicate with both cameras on while other times only the speaker may be visible. The researchers set out to determine whether being observed affects people's behavior during online communication. Co-authors Elan Barenholtz, Ph.D., associate professor of psychology at Florida Atlantic University, and Michael H. Kleiman, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher, compared fixation behavior in 173 participants under two conditions: one in which the participants believed they were engaging in a real-time interaction and one in which they knew they were watching a pre-recorded video. The researchers wanted to know if face fixation would increase in the real-time condition based on the social expectation of facing one's speaker in order to get attention or if it would lead to greater face avoidance, based on social norms as well as the cognitive demands of encoding the conversation. Similarly, they wanted to know where participants would fixate on the face. Would it be the eyes more in the real-time condition because of social demands to make eye contact with one's speaker? Or, in the pre-recorded condition, where the social demands to make eye contact are eliminated, would participants spend more time looking at the mouth in order to encode the conversation, which is consistent with previous studies showing greater mouth fixations during an encoding task. Three areas of interest for fixation analyses: full face (purple), eyes (red) and mouth (blue). Credit: Florida Atlantic University Results of the study showed that participants fixated on the whole face in the real-time condition and significantly less in the pre-recorded condition. In the pre-recorded condition, time spent fixating on the mouth was significantly greater compared to the real-time condition. There were no significant differences in time spent fixating on the eyes between the real-time and the pre-recorded conditions. These findings may suggest that participants are more comfortable looking directly at the mouth of a speaker - which has previously been found to be optimal for encoding speech - when they think that no one is watching them. To simulate a live interaction, the researchers convinced participants that they were engaging in a real-time, two-way video interaction (it was actually pre-recorded) where they could been seen and heard by the speaker, as well as a pre-recorded interaction where they knew the video was previously recorded and therefore the speaker could not see their behavior. \"Because gaze direction conveys so much socially relevant information, one's own gaze behavior is likely to be affected by whether one's eyes are visible to a speaker,\" said Barenholtz. \"For example, people may intend to signal that they are paying more attention to a speaker by fixating their face or eyes during a conversation. Conversely, extended eye contact also can be perceived as aggressive and therefore noticing one's eyes could lead to reduced direct fixation of another's face or eyes. Indeed, people engage in avoidant eye movements by periodically breaking and reforming eye contact during conversations.\" There was a highly significant tendency for participants engaging in perceived real-time interaction to display greater avoidant fixation behavior, which supports the idea that social contexts draw fixations away from the face compared to when social context is not a factor. When the face was fixated, attention was directed toward the mouth for the greater percentage of time in the pre-recorded condition versus the real-time condition. The lack of difference in time spent fixating the eyes suggests that the additional mouth fixations in the pre-recorded condition did not come at the cost of reduced eye fixation and must have derived from reduced fixations elsewhere on the face. Comparisons between total fixation durations of the eyes versus the mouth were calculated for both the real-time and pre-recorded conditions, with the eyes of both conditions being significantly more fixated than the mouth. Gender, age, cultural background, and native language did not have an influence on fixation behavior across conditions. \"Regardless of the specific mechanisms underlying the observed differences in fixation patterns, results from our study suggest participants were taking social and attentional considerations into account in the real-time condition,\" said Barenholtz. \"Given that encoding and memory have been found to be optimized by fixating the mouth, which was reduced overall in the real-time condition, this suggests that people do not fully optimize for speech encoding in a live interaction.\"",

        "link":"https:\/\/scienceblogs.com\/sb-admin\/2020\/03\/20\/how-spot-coronavirus-fake-news-151444",
        "text":"The proliferation of fake news about the COVID-19 pandemic has been labelled a dangerous \u201cinfodemic\u201d. Fake news spreads faster and more easily today through the internet, social media and instant messaging. These messages may contain useless, incorrect or even harmful information and advice, which can hamper the public health response and add to social disorder and division. Confusingly some fake news also contains a mixture of correct information, which makes it difficult to spot what is true and accurate. Fake news may also be shared by trusted friends and family, including those who are doctors and nurses. They might not have read the full story before sharing or just glanced over it. Before you decide to share, make sure to read stories properly and follow some checks to determine the accuracy. If the story appears to claim a much higher level of certainty in its advice and arguments than other stories, this is questionable. People will be seeking certainty in a time of high uncertainty, anxiety and panic. So it is only natural to more readily accept information that resolves, reassures and provides easy solutions \u2013 unfortunately, often in a false way. Similarly, if a story is more surprising or upsetting than other stories it is worth double-checking, as fake news will try to grab your attention by being more exaggerated than real stories. What to look out for Source. Question the source. References have been made to \u201cTaiwanese experts\u201d or \u201cJapanese doctors\u201d or \u201cStanford University\u201d during the outbreak. Check on official websites if stories are repeated there. If a source is \u201ca friend of a friend\u201d, this is a rumour unless you also know the person directly. Logo: Check whether any organisation\u2019s logo used in the message looks the same as on the official website. Bad English: Credible journalists and organisations are less likely to make repeated spelling and grammar mistakes. Also, anything written entirely in capital letters or containing a lot of exclamation marks should raise your suspicions. Pretend social media accounts: Some fake accounts mimic the real thing. For example, the unofficial Twitter handle @BBCNewsTonight, which was made to look like the legitimate @BBCNews account, shared a fake story about the actor Daniel Radcliffe testing positive for coronavirus. Media platforms try to remove or flag fake accounts and stories as well as verify real ones. Look out for what their policies are to try to do this. Over-encouragement to share: Be wary if the message presses you to share \u2013 this is how viral messaging works. Use fact-checking websites: Websites such as APFactCheck and Full Fact highlight common fake news stories. You can also use a search engine to look up the title of the article to see if it has been identified as fake news by the mainstream media. Who to trust The best sources to go to for health information about COVID-19 are your government health websites and the World Health Organization website. Primary sources are generally better than news articles. Even government messaging and the mainstream media can get things wrong, but they are more trustworthy than unverified sources on social media and viral messaging. For instance, The Conversation is a more trusted source because all content is written by academics who are experts in their fields. A time of high uncertainty. How Hwee Young\/EPA Charlatans have been promoting false preventions and cures for people to spend their money on. For example, the New York attorney general has had to send cease and desist notices for claims that toothpaste, dietary supplements and creams will prevent and cure COVID-19. The effects can also be more serious than losing some cash. Iran has reported at least 44 people died from alcohol poisoning after drinking bootleg alcohol in a misguided attempt to cure COVID-19. Unfortunately, the most basic and correct advice given so far does not offer a miracle or special insight. Wash your hands often (use hand sanitisers if you cannot), avoid touching your face, and sneeze or cough into the crook of your elbow or a tissue (and throw it away in a bag-lined bin). Avoid crowds and public places, keep a sensible distance from people, and do not travel unless absolutely necessary. Now many governments are introducing measures including travel bans and quarantines that need to be followed to protect the health of everyone, especially the most vulnerable. We can all get caught out. Think twice about the messages currently circulating and help guide your family and friends to decide what to trust.

        "link":"https:\/\/scienceblogs.com\/sb-admin\/2020\/05\/27\/nvx-cov2373-heres-how-coronavirus-vaccine-based-flu-shot-works-151450",
        "text":"A new trial has begun in Victoria this week to evaluate a potential vaccine against COVID-19. The vaccine is called NVX-CoV2373 and is from a US biotech company, Novavax. The trial will be carried out across Melbourne and Brisbane, and is the first human trial of a vaccine specifically for COVID-19 to take place in Australia. This vaccine is actually based on a vaccine that was already in development for influenza. But how might it work against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19? What\u2019s in the mix? Vaccines trigger an immune response by introducing the cells of our immune system to a virus in a safe way, without any exposure to the pathogen itself. All vaccines have to do two things. The first is make our immune cells bind to and \u201ceat up\u201d the vaccine. The second is to activate these immune cells so they\u2019re prepared to fight the current and any subsequent threats from the virus in question. We often add molecules called adjuvants to vaccines to deliver a danger signal to the immune system, activate immune cells and trigger a strong immune response. The Novavax vaccine is what we call a \u201csubunit\u201d vaccine because, instead of delivering the whole virus, it delivers only part of it. The element of SARS-CoV-2 in this vaccine is the spike protein, which is found on the surface of the virus. By targeting a particular protein, a subunit vaccine is a great way to focus the immune response. However, protein by itself is not very good at binding to and activating the cells of our immune system. Proteins are generally soluble, which doesn\u2019t appeal to immune cells. They like something they can chew on. So instead of soluble protein, Novavax has assembled the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein into very small particles, called nanoparticles. To immune cells, these nanoparticles look like little viruses, so immune cells can bind to these pre-packaged chunks of protein, rapidly engulfing them and becoming activated. The Novavax vaccine also contains an adjuvant called Matrix-M. While the nanoparticles deliver a modest danger signal, Matrix-M can be added to deliver a much stronger danger signal and really wake up the immune system. The spike protein is formed into nanoparticles to attract immune cells, and Matrix-M is added as an adjuvant to further activate immune cells. Author provided Rethinking an influenza vaccine The Novavax vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is based on a vaccine the company was already developing for influenza, called NanoFlu. The NanoFlu vaccine contains similar parts \u2013 nanoparticles with the Matrix-M adjuvant. But it uses a different protein in the nanoparticle (hemagglutinin, which is on the outside of the influenza virus). In October last year, Novavax started testing NanoFlu in a phase III clinical trial, the last level of clinical testing before a vaccine can be licensed. This trial had 2,650 volunteers and researchers were comparing whether NanoFlu performed as well as Fluzone, a standard influenza vaccine. An important feature of this trial is participants were over the age of 65. Older people tend to have poorer responses to vaccines, because immune cells become more difficult to activate as we age. This trial is ongoing, with volunteers to be followed until the end of the year. However, early results suggest NanoFlu can generate significantly higher levels of antibodies than Fluzone \u2013 even given the older people in the trial. Antibodies are small proteins made by our immune cells which bind strongly to viruses and can stop them from infecting cells in the nose and lungs. So increased antibodies with NanoFlu should result in lower rates of infection with influenza. These results were similar to those released after the phase I trial of NanoFlu, and suggest NanoFlu would be the superior vaccine for influenza. So the big question is \u2013 will the same strategy work for SARS-CoV-2? The Novavax vaccine is one of several potential COVID-19 vaccines being trialed around the world. Shutterstock The Australian clinical trial The new phase I\/II trial will enrol around 131 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 59 to assess the vaccine\u2019s safety and measure how it affects the body\u2019s immune response. Some volunteers will not receive the vaccine, as a placebo control. The rest will receive the vaccine, in a few different forms. The trial will test two doses of protein nanoparticles \u2013 a low (5 microgram) or a high (25 microgram) dose. Both doses will be delivered with Matrix-M adjuvant but the higher dose will also be tested without Matrix-M. All groups will receive two shots of the vaccine 21 days apart, except one group that will just get one shot. This design enables researchers to ask four important questions: can the vaccine induce an immune response? if so, what dose of nanoparticle is best? do you need adjuvant or are nanoparticles enough? do you need two shots or is one enough? While it\u2019s not yet clear how the vaccine will perform for SARS-CoV-2, Novavax has reported it generated strong immune responses in animals. And we know NanoFlu performed well and had a good safety profile for influenza. NanoFlu also seemed to work well in older adults, which would be essential for a vaccine for COVID-19. We eagerly await the first set of results, expected in a couple of months \u2013 an impressive turnaround time for a clinical trial. If this initial study is successful, the phase II portion of the trial will begin, with more participants. The Novavax vaccine joins at least nine other vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2 currently in clinical testing around the world.

        "text":"Picture this: it\u2019s April 2020, you\u2019re between Zoom meetings, and scrolling through your social media newsfeed. Headlines like \u201cDeath toll continues to rise\u201d, \u201cCOVID-19 may cause long-term health implications\u201d and \u201cHealth-care systems overwhelmed\u201d flash across your screen. Your mood takes a dive, but you can\u2019t stop scrolling. If this scenario rings true for you, you\u2019re not alone. Research shows people have a tendency to seek out information during uncertain times \u2013 it\u2019s a natural coping mechanism. But is persistent information-seeking on social media, sometimes called doomscrolling, helpful during a pandemic, or any time? Research on the effects of bad news on mood more generally suggest exposure to negative COVID news is likely to be detrimental to our emotional wellbeing. And indeed, early evidence on the effects of COVID news consumption on mental distress reflected this. For instance, one study conducted in March 2020 involving more than 6,000 Americans found that the more time participants spent consuming COVID news in a day, the unhappier they felt. These findings are striking but leave a few key questions unanswered. Does doomscrolling make people unhappy, or are unhappy people just more likely to doomscroll? How much time spent doomscrolling is a problem? And what would happen if, instead of doomscrolling, we were \u201ckindness scrolling\u201d \u2013 reading about humanity\u2019s positive responses to a global crisis? To find out, we conducted a study where we showed hundreds of people real-world content on either Twitter or YouTube for two to four minutes. The Twitter feeds and YouTube videos featured either general news about COVID, or news about kindness during COVID. We then measured these participants\u2019 moods using a questionnaire, and compared their moods with participants who did not engage with any content at all. People who were shown general COVID-related news experienced lower moods than people who were shown nothing at all. Meanwhile, people who were shown COVID news stories involving acts of kindness didn\u2019t experience the same decline in mood, but also didn\u2019t gain the boost in mood we\u2019d predicted. These findings suggest that spending as little as two to four minutes consuming negative news about COVID-19 can have a detrimental impact on our mood. Although we didn\u2019t see an improvement in mood among participants who were shown positive news stories involving acts of kindness, this may be because the stories were still related to COVID. In other research, positive news stories have been associated with improvements in mood. Making your social media a more positive place Our research was published earlier this month. Ironically, news coverage of our findings, with headlines such as \u201cJust five minutes spent on social media is enough to make you miserable, study finds\u201d, could be part of a person\u2019s doomscrolling content. But we didn\u2019t find that all social media use makes people miserable. Rather, we found that consuming negative content about COVID via Twitter or YouTube in the midst of a pandemic does. So what can we do to look after ourselves, and make our time on social media more pleasurable? We found that just a few minutes consuming negative news about COVID-19 can have a detrimental impact on our mood. Nuchylee\/Shutterstock One option is to delete our social media accounts altogether. Figures show almost half of Facebook users in the UK and the US considered leaving the platform in 2020. But how realistic is it to distance ourselves from platforms that connect nearly half of the world\u2019s population, particularly when these platforms offer social interactions at a time when face-to-face interactions can be risky, or impossible? Given that avoidance might not be practical, here are some other ways to make your experience on social media more positive. Be mindful of what you consume on social media. If you log on to connect with other people, focus on the personal news and photos shared instead of the latest headlines. Seek out content that makes you happy to balance out your newsfeed. This may be images of cute kittens, beautiful landscapes, drool-worthy food videos or something else. You could even follow a social media account dedicated to sharing only happy and positive news. Use social media to promote positivity and kindness. Sharing good things that are happening in your life can improve your mood, and your positive mood can spread to others. You may also like to compliment others on social media. While this might sound awkward, people will appreciate it more than you think. Importantly, we\u2019re not suggesting that you avoid all news and negative content. We need to know what\u2019s happening in the world. However, we should also be mindful of our mental health. As the pandemic continues to alter our lives and newsfeeds, our findings highlight the importance of being aware of the emotional toll negative news takes on us. But there are steps we can take to mitigate this toll and make our social media a happier place.

        "text":"Despite claims of anti-vaccine activists no different than groups that used to claim vaccines cause autism, COVID-19 vaccines do not impact fecundability\u2014the probability of conception per menstrual cycle\u2014in female or male partners who received the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson vaccines. The prospective study instead indicates that COVID-19 infection among males may temporarily reduce fertility\u2014 an outcome that could be avoidable through vaccination. Lead author Dr. Amelia Wesselink, epidemiologist at Boston University School of Public Health, and colleagues analyzed survey data on COVID-19 vaccination and infection, and fecundability, among female and male participants in the BUSPH-based Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO), an ongoing NIH-funded study that enrolls women trying to conceive, and follows them from preconception through six months after delivery. Participants included 2,126 women in the US and Canada who provided information on sociodemographics, lifestyle, medical factors, and characteristics of their partners from December 2020 to September 2021, and the participants were followed in the study through November 2021. The researchers calculated the per menstrual cycle probability of conception using self-reported dates of participants\u2019 last menstrual period, typical menstrual cycle length, and pregnancy status. Fertility rates among female participants who received at least one dose of a vaccine were nearly identical to unvaccinated female participants. Fecundability was also similar for male partners who had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine compared with unvaccinated male participants. Additional analyses that considered the number of vaccine doses, brand of vaccine, infertility history, occupation, and geographic region also indicated no effect of vaccination on fertility. While COVID-19 infection was not strongly associated with fertility, men who tested positive for COVID within 60 days of a given cycle had reduced fertility compared to men who never tested positive, or men who tested positive at least 60 days prior. This data supports previous research that has linked COVID-19 infection in men with poor sperm quality and other reproductive dysfunction. \u201cThese data provide reassuring evidence that COVID vaccination in either partner does not affect fertility among couples trying to conceive,\u201d says study senior author Dr. Lauren Wise, professor of epidemiology at BUSPH. \u201cThe prospective study design, large sample size, and geographically heterogeneous study population are study strengths, as was our control for many variables such as age, socioeconomic status, preexisting health conditions, occupation, and stress levels.\u201d The new data also help quell concerns about COVID-19 vaccines and fertility that arose from anecdotal reports of females experiencing menstrual cycle changes following vaccination.",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.popsci.com\/diy\/order-free-at-home-covid-tests\/",
        "text":"With the winter holidays approaching, you should take a few minutes today to order the handful of free at-home COVID-19 tests the US Postal Service is holding for you. Testing before you gather with friends and family can help reduce the likelihood of coronavirus infections or reinfections. Every residential address in the US, Puerto Rico and other US territories, as well as those linked to overseas military and diplomatic personnel, can again request four free rapid antigen tests from the USPS. Although the federal government suspended the program in September, the Biden administration reopened ordering on Thursday following an increase in COVID-19 cases after Thanksgiving. Order shipments will begin the week of December 19, the White House said. If you still have tests you ordered during the January, mid-March, or mid-May order windows, don\u2019t throw them out\u2014use the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s searchable at-home test database to see if their expiration dates have been extended. Given that Congress has not approved additional funding for a federal COVID-19 response, it\u2019s worth hanging onto as many usable tests as you can. How to order free at-home COVID tests Placing your order for tests is easy: Go to the special USPS website, enter your name, provide your shipping address (even if it\u2019s a residential P.O. box), and hit Check Out Now under the order summary that confirms the delivery is entirely free. You can also provide an email address if you want to get shipment notifications, but you don\u2019t have to. Those living in multi-family, co-living, or other shared living spaces can place more than one order as long as the USPS knows the address houses multiple unrelated families, but may be unable to if the government doesn\u2019t know several families live there. If that happens, you can file a service request or call the USPS help desk at 1-800-ASK-USPS to try to get it fixed. If you need help placing an order, you can call 1-800-232-0233 Monday through Friday between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, or between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. on the weekends, for assistance in English, Spanish, and more than 150 other languages. There\u2019s also a teletype (TTY) or text telephone number at 1-888-720-7489 and the aforementioned USPS help desk. People with disabilities can call the disability information and access line at 1-888-677-1199 between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m. EST, Monday through Friday, or email DIAL@usaginganddisability.org. When to expect delivery With shipments starting the week of December 19, you should receive your order a couple days after ordering them. The White House said in May that the USPS dropped off most tests within 48 hours, but you can contact the USPS if you have any issues with delivery. All tests sent to continental US addresses will ship with First Class Package Service (arriving in one to five days), and all other addresses will get them via Priority Mail (arriving in one to three days). [Related: Why some long COVID clinics fail chronic illness patients] If you provide an email address when you order, you will get shipping notifications and can track the package on the USPS website. You can\u2019t pick the tests up anywhere, even your local post office\u2014they will always come to the address you provided, the agency says. When to take a rapid antigen test When you receive your tests, the package will display an expiration date, but the FDA has extended most of these beyond what may appear on the label. As mentioned above, you can use the agency\u2019s database to check your tests\u2019 actual expiration dates. As long as your tests haven\u2019t expired, the government recommends you take them if you begin having COVID symptoms like a fever, sore throat, runny nose, or loss of taste or smell; at least five days after you are in close contact with someone who has since tested positive for COVID; or before you gather with a group, especially if that group includes people at risk of severe disease or who aren\u2019t up to date on their vaccinations (keep in mind that you may not know who\u2019s at risk, either). It\u2019s also worth noting that you should let your tests come to room temperature before using them\u2014especially if they were delivered in freezing or blistering hot temperatures. Although the tests are built to survive a range of conditions, they might not work as well if they\u2019re cold, the government says. Generally, rapid antigen tests are meant to be used in an environment that\u2019s somewhere between 59 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit (15 to 30 degrees Celsius), but your tests should come with specific instructions about this. The government recommends letting the unopened package sit indoors for at least two hours before opening and using any of the tests inside. How to take a rapid antigen test Each test kit comes with directions for how to use it, and they all involve swabbing the inside of your nose. You should get results within 30 minutes and you won\u2019t have to leave your home. If you don\u2019t follow the instructions, the result could be wrong. For visual learners, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a how-to video, and it also has one for people who use American Sign Language. How to interpret COVID test results Your test will also tell you how to interpret the results, and what to do afterward, but if you test positive you very likely have COVID. You should follow the CDC\u2019s latest guidance, which suggests you isolate for at least five days, even from people in your home. You may also want to talk to your doctor, and definitely should if you have a weakened immune system, other health conditions like cancer and diabetes, or increased risk due to a factor like smoking or obesity, the government says. [Related: The Postal Service helps keep millions of Americans alive and well] If the results come out negative, the test didn\u2019t find COVID in your body, and you might have a lower risk of spreading the disease. It\u2019s worth noting that these at-home antigen tests generally aren\u2019t as accurate as PCR tests, for example, which are processed by laboratories. So if you think you got a false negative, the government suggests testing again within a few days, leaving at least 24 hours between tests. Again, for visual learners, the CDC has a video about how to interpret results, including individual ones in ASL for understanding positive and negative results. This story has been updated.

        "text":"The Twitter discourse surrounding the potential addition of an \u201cEdit Tweet\u201d feature has existed pretty much as long as the social media platform itself, but the longest time it\u2019s felt like more of a pipe dream than anything else. Twitter co-founder and former CEO, Jack Dorsey, even went so far as to surmise that it would \u201cnever happen\u201d back in 2020. Today, however, it looks like the company is actually considering making the ability to fix those annoying typos and regretful hot takes a reality\u2026 but it\u2019s going to (at least initially) cost you. if you see an edited Tweet it's because we're testing the edit button this is happening and you'll be okay \u2014 Twitter (@Twitter) September 1, 2022 \u201cThe screenshot below may look a lot like an edited Tweet. That\u2019s because it is, and you could be seeing more of them soon,\u201d reads the opening of Twitter\u2019s official Thursday morning announcement. Beginning today, the platform is internally testing an edit ability, and plans to extend the feature to a single country\u2019s premium-paying Twitter Blue users later this month. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that, with the availability of Edit Tweet, Tweeting will feel more approachable and less stressful,\u201d the blog post continues. \u201cYou should be able to participate in the conversation in a way that makes sense to you, and we\u2019ll keep working on ways that make it feel effortless to do just that.\u201d [Related: These are the pros and cons of a Twitter edit feature.] Twitter Blue currently runs you $4.99 per month\u2014which just so happened to increase from $2.99\/mo. earlier this summer. The subscription currently includes features like a customizable navigation bar, \u201cUndo Tweet\u201d option, and NFT profile pictures. If you\u2019re suddenly considering signing up, you\u2019re probably gonna have to wait a minute: Twitter Blue\u2019s homepage is currently down at the time of writing. As desirable an edit button is for many Twitter users, many critics are wary of the socio-political and ethical implications of a poorly executed update. \u201cThese platforms are big enough that no change you could make would be an unmitigated good for every single user,\u201d Gennie Gebhart, activism director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told PopSci earlier this year. \u201cWith an edit button, you have to think what are the possibilities for harassment, for gaslighting, or for deception?\u201d [Related: Twitter announces new podcast integration.] According to Twitter, however, current plans include the inclusion of a complete edit history for tweets, along with the ability to still see past iterations of a tweet. As it stands, the ability to edit one\u2019s tweet will also only be available for the 30 minutes following initial publication, which may handle some of the worries surrounding the feature.",

        "title":"The back-to-school guide for fighting common viruses",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.popsci.com\/health\/virus-prevention-back-to-school\/",
        "text":"Having a sick kid is no fun. Fortunately, even though the viruses that are common in childhood can pack a punch, these not-exactly-alive microorganisms are almost always defeated by soap, masks, open windows, and vaccines. Still, kids get sick a lot. And once they get better, it\u2019s on to the next bug. \u201cKids tend to get a lot of infections because their immune system is naive in comparison to an adult who might have encountered some of these viruses before,\u201d says Kishana Taylor, a post-doctoral researcher at Rutgers University\u2013Newark who co-founded the Black Microbiologists Association. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for little ones to get vaccinated: Even when they haven\u2019t been exposed to a virus, they\u2019re still protected. Getting vaccinated can also stop a child from getting sick, and keep them from infecting classmates, school staff, and their families. Or if they do get sick, they\u2019ll have an easier time of it. [Related: How to buy masks for kids] You should probably call a doctor if a child or teenager has any of these symptoms: a high fever, neck pain, shortness of breath, and lethargy (that is, significantly less energy than usual). Parents and guardians \u201cknow their kids the best,\u201d says Jorge Moreno, a physician and assistant professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine. \u201cCalling the pediatrician\u2019s office early can provide some more specific advice for the child,\u201d he adds. \u201cIf the call or visit is delayed, the child\u2019s illness may be more severe, and may require an urgent visit to the emergency room.\u201d Here\u2019s what you should know about the most relevant childhood viruses. SARS-CoV-2 What\u2019s this virus? As a respiratory virus, SARS-CoV-2 spreads when an infected person is, as you might guess, coughing or sneezing. Talking, laughing, and singing spread the pathogen, too: It\u2019s all due to the little droplets you make when you open your mouth and breathe. And it\u2019s very common in children, who account for about 1 in 5 cases in the US. Though COVID-19, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is typically a mild illness for children, some people in their lives\u2014grandparents, for example\u2014are at a higher risk. Prevention advice: According to the CDC\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine guidelines, children as young as 6 months can be vaccinated, either in a three-dose or two-dose series, depending on age. Boosters that protect from Omicron subvariants will also soon be available for ages 12 and older. Masks are another option. Basically, viruses hate them. Children over the age of 2 are able to wear masks. As Canada\u2019s Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam recently noted, if a child is comfortable wearing masks, they should stick to them. \u201cI would say the riskiest behavior that parents can have any control over is going to be not masking while indoors,\u201d Taylor says. If a child practices good hygiene and gets vaccinated, it impacts the entire community: teachers, bus drivers, janitors, and those with a compromised immune system. It\u2019s not just about protecting the child and their family\u2014it\u2019s protecting anyone that child has come into contact with, too. Influenza viruses What\u2019s this virus? Influenza\u2014the flu\u2014is everywhere, and it can lead to serious complications in children. Each year from 2010 to 2020, between 7,000 and 26,000 children were hospitalized for the flu in the US, the CDC estimates. Kids under 5 are vulnerable to serious complications, and toddlers and infants are especially at risk. Children can die from the flu, though it\u2019s quite rare. According to the CDC, from 2004 to 2020, between 37 and 199 deaths were reported during the flu season\u2013with the exception of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, when 358 pediatric flu-related deaths were reported. (That\u2019s likely an undercount, the health agency says.) Children who weren\u2019t vaccinated for the flu accounted for 80 percent of these deaths. [Related: The surprising ways your immune system adapts to the flu virus you got as a kid] Like SARS-CoV-2, this is a respiratory pathogen. It spreads the easiest indoors, which is why we call the fall and winter flu season. Viruses are weaker outdoors: They don\u2019t like the beach, where breezes quickly disperse any microbes that people breathe out. Prevention advice: To prevent infection, children can get a flu shot at a doctor\u2019s office or pharmacy. Your local school might be organizing a vaccine clinic day, too. The CDC recommends kids get a flu vaccine every year, ideally before the end of October. Even toddlers and infants can get a flu shot, as long as they\u2019re over 6 months old. And there\u2019s good news for kids (and adults) who can\u2019t handle needles: it\u2019s not just a flu \u201cshot\u201d anymore. A nasal spray vaccine is available for most people over 2 years old. \u201cWatch out for flu vaccines coming in the next few weeks,\u201d Moreno says. To slow the spread, sanitize and wash your hands. Do it often\u2014probably more often than you think you need to. And if you have to sneeze or cough, don\u2019t do it into your hands. Crook your arm and put your mouth near your elbow, not your hands. As Sesame Street says: Sneeze in the bendy place. (The dance move dabbing may not have a kid-friendly origin, but it\u2019s a fun way to practice sneezing safely!) Another way to explain it to kids: Be a vampire hiding behind a cape. Rhinoviruses What\u2019s this virus? The common cold is a respiratory infection that is caused by a rhinovirus. Sometimes, symptoms are not just a sneezy, sniffly mess: Rhinoviruses can lead to painful ear infections. A sinus infection can happen, too\u2014they\u2019re typically due to viruses. (Influenza and parainfluenza can cause this acute facial pain, as well. And, by the way, though most sore throats are caused by viruses, a strep throat isn\u2019t: group A Streptococcus bacteria are to blame.) Prevention advice: Unlike the flu, which is typically more severe, we don\u2019t have a vaccine for the common cold. We do have the power of soap, of course. Wash your hands often, and help your kids do the same. Don\u2019t touch your face. Distance yourself from anyone who seems sick. And don\u2019t forget the vampire sneeze! Also, any room where groups gather should be adequately ventilated. This could be as simple as keeping windows and doors open. Depending on the district or the school, \u201cyou may be allowed to provide an air purifier or Corsi-Rosenthal box, but mileage may vary,\u201d Taylor says. Measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox What\u2019s this virus? These highly contagious illnesses are grouped together because they can be immunized at one time. Measles, in particular, can be serious or even fatal in children, especially in kids under 5. But fatal cases are rare: For every 1,000 children with measles, 1 to 3 will die from complications, such as pneumonia. Prevention advice: Unlike the common cold, we have vaccines for these illnesses . There are two options: the MMR vaccine (measles, mumps, and rubella), which children can get starting at 12 months; and the MMRV vaccine, which tackles the virus that causes chickenpox (varicella zoster). Infants should get the first dose between 12 and 15 months of age, and the second dose anytime between ages 4 and 6. Monkeypox What\u2019s this virus? At this point, it is very unlikely that a US child will be infected with monkeypox, the American Academy of Pediatrics says. Only a handful of pediatric cases have been confirmed in the US. Like chickenpox and hand-foot-and-mouth disease, monkeypox causes a red, blistery rash. That rash is reportedly quite painful and itchy, and it typically goes away within four weeks. [Related: How to talk with your kids about the COVID vaccine] It spreads via prolonged face-to-face interactions (without masks), contact with an infected person\u2019s rash or scabs, and contact with items they have touched, such as blankets and towels. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is also spread through stool and saliva, which is why hand washing is so important. Prevention advice: Some schools are preparing for potential outbreaks using CDC guidelines, which state that \u201csettings should follow their everyday operational guidance that reduces the transmission of infectious diseases.\u201d That means disinfecting surfaces, offering personal protective equipment (PPE) to staff who care for children who have been infected, and encouraging community members to wash their hands and stay home when they feel sick. Children with this rash should do their best to not scratch (an almost impossible task!), keep the spots covered, and not touch their eyes. Norovirus What\u2019s this virus? This contagious stomach bug leads to a variety of \u201ctummy issues,\u201d such as diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and more. (It\u2019s not the flu, though, and it\u2019s not food poisoning, either.) Prevention advice: The virus spreads through contaminated foods, water, and surfaces, so make sure to wash your hands, especially before touching food! To help others stay healthy, the CDC says that children should stay home when they\u2019re sick, and for two days after symptoms subside. Poliovirus What\u2019s this virus? Poliovirus\u2014a very contagious virus that spreads through fecal and respiratory contact\u2014presents a serious risk for children under 5. It can paralyze a child, or even kill them. Prevention advice: There is no polio cure. But there is a vaccine, which is so effective that the disease was nearly wiped off the planet decades ago. This may be changing, however: Though over 92 percent of children under 2 have been vaccinated for polio, vaccination rates vary across the country. New York reported one new case in July. \u201cThe best next step would be for parents to check with their pediatrician if their children are up to date with their vaccines, including the polio series,\u201d Moreno says.",

        "text":"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorize Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna\u2019s new bivalent COVID-19 booster shots. The new vaccines, which the FDA will also call \u201cupdated boosters,\u201d contain two messenger RNA (mRNA) components: one targets the original strain of the virus and the other targets omicron\u2019s extremely contagious BA.5 subvariant that is currently responsible for the majority of COVID-19 infections. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine booster is available to anyone 12 and older at least two months after a completed primary vaccination or those who received the third booster shot that only targets the original strain, like the previous boosters from 2021. [Related: Omicron-specific COVID vaccine approved in the UK.] The Moderna vaccine is available to anyone over 18 at least two months after the first two doses or if you received a third shot without the booster. It is important to check vaccination records or with a healthcare provider with any questions about when to receive a booster. The move comes before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting, amidst concerns over waning immunity and a potential fall and winter surge of the virus. \u201cThe COVID-19 vaccines, including boosters, continue to save countless lives and prevent the most serious outcomes (hospitalization and death) of COVID-19,\u201d said FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf in a press release. \u201cAs we head into fall and begin to spend more time indoors, we strongly encourage anyone who is eligible to consider receiving a booster dose with a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine to provide better protection against currently circulating variants.\u201d Last week, federal health officials noted to The New York Times that they are eager to deliver updated boosters as quickly as possible, pointing to a death toll that averages about 450 Americans per day. That number could rise in the coming months when the weather gets colder and people spend more time inside. On August 15, Great Britain became the first country to authorize a bivalent vaccine, where half of a dose targets the original COVID-19 strain and the other half targets BA.5. The vaccine is updated version of Moderna\u2019s original COVID vaccine and generated a good immune response to these two variants, as well as the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants in adults, in clinical trials. The FDA asked vaccine manufacturers to tailor new shots that target the two dominant subvariants (BA.4 and BA.5) this past June, adding that the regulatory group would not require studies testing the shots in humans for the vaccines to be authorized. This process is similar to how how annual changes to flu vaccines are handled, as the influenza virus is constantly mutating. The Biden administration is currently planning a vaccine campaign roll out set to begin after Labor Day. [Related: If you\u2019re unsure about getting the COVID-19 vaccine, read this.] According to the FDA, The mRNA in these boosters is a specific piece of genetic material that instructs cells in the body to make the distinctive \u201cspike\u201d protein of the original virus strain and the omicron variant lineages BA.4 and BA.5. The spike proteins of BA.4 and BA.5 are identical. \u201cWe are confident in the evidence supporting these authorizations,\u201d said Peter Marks, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research in a press release. \u201cThe public can be assured that a great deal of care has been taken by the FDA to ensure that these bivalent COVID-19 vaccines meet our rigorous safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality standards for emergency use authorization.\u201d Correction: A previous version of this post said the FDA decision followed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).

        "text":"1748-9326\/17\/9\/094017 The heat index, or apparent temperature, was never defined for extreme heat and humidity, leading to the widespread adoption of a polynomial extrapolation designed by the United States National Weather Service. Recently, however, the heat index has been extended to all combinations of temperature and humidity, presenting an opportunity to reassess past heat waves. Here, three-hourly temperature and humidity are used to evaluate the extended heat index over the contiguous United States during the years 1984\u20132020. It is found that the 99.9th percentile of the daily maximum heat index is highest over the Midwest. Identifying and ranking heat waves by the spatially integrated exceedance of that percentile, the Midwest once again stands out as home to the most extreme heat waves, including the top-ranked July 2011 and July 1995 heat waves. The extended heat index can also be used to evaluate the physiological stress induced by heat and humidity. It is found that the most extreme Midwest heat waves tax the cardiovascular system with a skin blood flow that is elevated severalfold, approaching the physiological limit. These effects are not captured by the National Weather Service's polynomial extrapolation, which also underestimates the heat index by as much as 10 \u2218 C (20 \u2218 F) during severe heat waves.

Introduction Among meteorological phenomena, heat waves are the number one cause of death in the United States (Changnon et al 1996). Heat waves pose a particular threat to the elderly (Carleton et al 2020), those without access to air conditioning (O'Neill et al 2005), and outdoors workers (Acharya et al 2018). As the Earth warms, the frequency and severity of heat waves is expected to increase (Dosio et al 2018). It is important, therefore, to have accurate metrics for heat waves, both to issue operational warnings and to plan adaptations for the future. Many different metrics have been used to define, identify, and measure heat waves (Xu et al 2016). Defined as having an anomalously high air temperature, heat waves in the contiguous United States (CONUS) are found to be most severe in the South (Meehl and Tebaldi 2004, Dosio et al 2018). Heat waves have also been defined using the heat index, also known as the apparent temperature, which is a metric that maps one-to-one onto physiological states (different rates of skin blood flow) in hot conditions (Steadman 1979). Most studies that define heat waves in terms of the heat index also find that the frequency of heat waves peaks in the South (e.g. Smith et al 2013, Lyon and Barnston 2017). An exception is the study of Robinson (2001), who found that heat waves are comparably frequent in the South, Midwest, and Mid-Atlantic. It is notable, however, that these studies\u2014and all other studies that have used Steadman's heat index to study heat waves\u2014have used not the actual heat index, but a functional approximation to the heat index. Of the many different approximations (Anderson et al 2013), the most widely used is the polynomial fit developed by the United States National Weather Service (Rothfusz 1990, National Weather Service 2014). The National Weather Service (NWS) approximation is used on a regular basis to issue warnings to the public and to study past severe heat (e.g. Robinson 2001, Kim et al 2006, Yip et al 2008, Smith et al 2013, Lyon and Barnston 2017, Tustin et al 2018, Xie et al 2018, Perera et al 2022) and future severe heat (e.g. Delworth et al 1999, Diffenbaugh et al 2007, Opitz-Stapleton et al 2016, Diem et al 2017, Modarres et al 2018, Dahl et al 2019, Rao et al 2020, Rahman et al 2021, Amnuaylojaroen et al 2022). Even in the current climate, there are conditions hotter and more humid than were considered and tabulated by Steadman (1979), and so the NWS approximation is used to extrapolate the heat index beyond those tabulated values. That extrapolation is used extensively in operational warnings and in the aforementioned research studies. From the perspective of social impacts, heat waves would ideally be identified and quantified using not an extrapolation but an accurate measure of physiological stress. Recently, Lu and Romps (2022) extended Steadman's heat index to all combinations of temperature and humidity, providing such a measure. The objectives of this paper are threefold: (a) to use the extended heat index to define and rank the most severe heat waves experienced over the United States during recent decades, (b) to evaluate the extent to which the NWS approximation errs in reporting the heat index during those heat waves, and (c) to evaluate the physiological state required of humans exposed to conditions during the most severe of those heat waves. 2. The heat index To motivate the use of the heat index, we give here a brief review. As is well known, sweating is a physiological adaptation to high temperatures, with the evaporation of sweat providing a cooling effect. But this adaptation has limits: if the air is sufficiently hot and humid, evaporative cooling is unable to compensate for the inputs of metabolic heat, sensible heat, and infrared radiation, and the core temperature rises. In general, in hot and humid conditions, humans are subjected to greater physiological stress if either the temperature or humidity increases. To capture these effects, Steadman (1979) developed a model of thermoregulation with parameters chosen to represent a healthy adult walking in the shade with ample access to drinking water. The model quantifies the behavior (clothing thickness) and physiology (skin blood flow) in response to a combination of temperature and humidity. An important aspect of this model is that the human responds to changes in temperature and humidity by adjusting only one parameter at a time. For example, in relatively cold conditions, the human responds to changes in temperature by adjusting the thickness of the clothing being worn. Once that response has been exhausted (i.e. the clothing thickness has been driven to zero), the human responds by adjusting its skin blood flow. As a consequence, all states form a one-dimensional family, i.e. the states can be parameterized by a single variable. For example, in the original Steadman model, the states could be parameterized by \u03b6 with the clothing thickness in millimeteres equal to for \u03b6 < 0 and the skin blood flow, in liters per minute, elevated by an amount of \u03b6 for . Since the space of states is one-dimensional, whereas the space of all possible temperature and humidity is two-dimensional, each state corresponds to a one-dimensional isopleth in temperature-humidity space. For example, all pairs of temperature and humidity corresponding to a clothing thickness of five millimeters form a continuous one-dimensional curve with . So long as the actual air temperature and humidity remain on an isopleth, a human's experience of those conditions does not change (e.g. the choice of clothing or the skin blood flow remains the same). The heat index, which is a function of temperature and humidity, is simply a convention for assigning a unique temperature to each isopleth: the heat index is defined to be the temperature of the isopleth at 1600 Pa (Steadman 1979). For illustration, figure 1 shows the curve corresponding to \u03b6 = 0.88 (the state with an extra 0.88 l min\u22121 of skin blood flow), which intercepts a vapor pressure of 1600 Pa at a temperature of 60 \u2218C (140 \u2218F). All pairs of temperature and humidity lying on this curve have a heat index of 60 \u2218C and induce identical behavioral and physiological responses (minimization of clothing and an extra skin blood flow of 0.88 l min\u22121). In this way, every pair of temperature and humidity can be mapped to a value of the heat index and a thermoregulatory state. This is useful for communicating the hazard posed by high heat and humidity. For example, a heat index of 60 \u2218C (140 \u2218F) corresponds to a skin blood flow that is about two and a half times its value at room temperature. Maintaining a high skin blood flow can stress the cardiovascular system, even leading to death by heart failure. On the other hand, failing to maintain the required skin blood flow would lead to an elevated core temperature, which, if elevated by only a few degrees, can lead to death by hyperthermia. Figure 1. The curve, in temperature-humidity space, corresponding to the state with an extra 0.88 liters per minute of skin blood flow. The small circle indicates where the curve intercepts the reference vapor pressure of 1600 Pa. The temperature of that point is 60 \u2218C (140 \u2218F), which defines the heat index (HI) for all points on the curve. Download figure: Standard image High-resolution image Unfortunately, the heat index defined by Steadman (1979) was defined only up to certain combinations of heat and humidity, beyond which the heat index was undefined. Those originally undefined regions are labeled V and VI in figure 8 of Lu and Romps (2022). For example, Steadman was unable to define the heat index for 30 \u2218C (86 \u2218F) at 90% relative humidity, or for 35 \u2218C (95 \u2218F) at 65% relative humidity. The heat index was left undefined in those conditions due to an apparent failure of the underlying model of thermoregulation: the vapor pressure at the skin surface exceeded the saturation value. To allow for extrapolation beyond this point of apparent failure, the NWS developed and adopted a polynomial fit to the heat index as a function of temperature and humidity (Rothfusz 1990, National Weather Service 2014). But without a model of thermoregulation at the high values of temperature and humidity, those extrapolated values have no interpretation with respect to a thermoregulatory state. Furthermore, as will be shown below, the extrapolated values used by the NWS are biased low by \u223c10 \u2218C (\u223c20 \u2218F) during the peaks of severe heat waves. Recently, Lu and Romps (2022) showed that Steadman's model, and therefore the heat index, could be extended in a physical way. One of the keys to extending the model to high heat and humidity is to allow sweat to drip off the skin; this simple fix avoids any water-vapor supersaturation. This extension is backwards compatible\u2014it gives the same values as the model of Steadman (1979) where the original model was defined\u2014but extends the definition of the heat index to all combinations of temperature and humidity. And, as with the original heat index, every value maps one-to-one to a one-dimensional family of thermoregulatory states, which are parameterized by the fraction of skin covered by clothing in very cold conditions, the thickness of clothing in cold-to-mild conditions, the skin blood flow in hot conditions, and the rate of core-temperature rise in dangerously hot or lethal conditions. 3. Methods To calculate the heat index (HI), we use the instantaneous two-meter temperature and humidity from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR; Mesinger et al 2006), which provides data at a grid spacing of 32 km every three hours. We calculate the extended heat index (Lu and Romps 2022) for each three hourly snapshot from 1 January 1984 to 31 December 2020. We also calculate the polynomial fit to the heat index developed by the National Weather Service (Rothfusz 1990, National Weather Service 2014) with one minor modification made here to avoid bad behavior at cold temperatures (see the appendix ). We will identify and quantify heat waves using the spatially integrated exceedance of the daily maximum heat index beyond its local 99.9th percentile of daily maxima. This choice defines heat waves in terms of their severity as perceived by humans, although there are other choices that could be made (e.g. weighting the exceedance by population density). The 99.9th percentile is chosen to isolate the most extreme events, i.e. those events comprised of values with a \u223c3 year (1000 day) return period. We first define a grid cell's daily maximum heat index HI as the highest HI among UTC 12, 15, 18, and 21 on the same date and UTC 0, 3, 6, and 9 of the following day. During spring, summer, and early fall, when CONUS is observing daylight saving, this captures all available NARR data from 5am to 2am (next day) local time on the West Coast and 8am to 5am (next day) local time on the East Coast. With 37 years of data, this gives 13 515 daily maximum values. The next step is to calculate, separately for each grid cell, the 99.9th percentile of HI over all 13 515 days, which we denote by HI 99.9 . The map of HI 99.9 is shown in the left panel of figure 2. We see that the most extreme values of the heat index do not occur in the South as one might expect, but in the Midwestern states of Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri. In those states, the 99.9th percentile of the daily maximum heat index reaches up to and beyond 60 \u2218C (140 \u2218F). As seen in the right panel of figure 2, these extreme values are not captured by the polynomial extrapolation used by the NWS. In those midwestern states, the 99.9th percentile is underestimated by the NWS polynomial by as much as \u223c10 \u2218C (\u223c20 \u2218F). Figure 2. (Left) The 99.9th percentile of the daily maximum heat index HI 99.9 . (Right) The 99.9th percentile of the daily maximum heat index calculated by the NWS approximation minus the actual HI 99.9 . Download figure: Standard image High-resolution image To prepare to identify heat waves, we first calculate the daily time series of the integral over CONUS of the number of degrees that HI is in excess of the 99.9th percentile, where x and y denote east\u2013west and north\u2013south distance and d denotes the day. This time series has 13 515 values: one for each day from 1 January 1984 to 31 December 2020. To find the first heat wave, we identify the maximum value in this time series. To find the start and end of that heat wave, we find the largest contiguous interval in that time series containing that maximum for which all values are at least 25% as large as that maximum; this defines the heat wave. We then find the two nearest local minima that bracket that heat wave and set to zero the interval that starts and ends with those two local minima. We then repeat the process to find the second heat wave, and so on. This identifies heat waves naturally ranked by the peak of their area-integrated exceedance of HI 99.9 . The sensitivity of this ranking to the threshold, chosen here to be 25%, is explored in figures S1 and S2. A lower threshold would result in longer-duration heat waves, but would not substantially alter the ranking of the most severe heat waves: for threshold values ranging from 4% to 34%, the ranking of the top five heat waves is unchanged. 4. Results For visualization of a heat wave, we define HI for each grid cell as the largest HI in that grid cell during the days of the heat wave. For each of the top nine heat waves identified by the algorithm described above, figure 3 displays HI minus HI 99.9 . The most severe heat wave (heat wave #1) is found to be centered on the Midwest during 17\u201322 July 2011. This time and place corresponds to a heat wave that generated a raft of news coverage and a dramatic spike in heat-related illness (Storm and Fowler 2011, Berry et al 2013, Fuhrmann et al 2016). The second most severe heat wave (heat wave #2) is identified as occurring over the same region during 12\u201315 July 1995. This again corresponds to a well-known heat wave that hit the city of Chicago especially hard, leading to hundreds of heat-related deaths (Semenza et al 1996, 1999, Whitman et al 1997, Dematte et al 1998). A list of the top 20 heat waves is given in table 1. Although the Midwest occupies only 26% of the area of the contiguous United States, it contains the peak heat index during 7 of the top 10 heat waves. This is particularly notable in comparison to the South, which occupies 29% of the area, but contains the peak heat index during only 3 of the top 10 heat waves. A list of the top 100 heat waves identified by this algorithm is given in tables S1 and S2 and maps of their are shown in figure S3. Figure 3.

In both cases, the heat index reaches values well in excess of 60 \u2218C (140 \u2218F), reaching 70 \u2218C (157 \u2218F) during the 2011 heat wave and 68 \u2218C (154 \u2218F) during the 1995 heat wave. Compared to , HI is more tightly peaked in the Midwest with typical values of \u223c130 \u2218F\u2013150 \u2218F. Since Steadman's original model fails for such high heat and humidity, the NWS has used its polynomial fit to report a heat index by extrapolation. The values resulting from that extrapolation are shown in the middle row of figure 4. The peak values of the heat index are noticeably muted in the NWS extrapolation. The error in the NWS extrapolation, shown in the bottom row of figure 4, is \u223c10 \u2218C (\u223c20 \u2218F) for the peak values of the heat index. Figure 4. (Top) Actual HI for the top two heat waves. (Middle) The HI according to the NWS approximation. (Bottom) The error in the NWS approximation. Download figure: Standard image High-resolution image During the July 1995 heat wave, the NWS reported a peak heat index of 119 \u2218F at O'Hare airport and 125 \u2218F at Midway airport. Those values were subsequently referenced by major newspapers (Kaye 1995, Lev and Ryan 1995, Nathans 1995, Stein and Kaplan 1995), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (1995), CDC, and research studies (Whitman et al 1997, Dematte et al 1998, Semenza et al 1999, Grady 2013). Using the hourly temperature and relative humidity recorded at O'Hare and Midway, we find that the NWS extrapolation yields a peak HI of 118 \u2218F at O'Hare airport at 1pm local time (when the temperature was 100 F and the relative humidity was 50%) and 124 \u2218F at Midway airport at 12pm (temperature of 100 F and relative humidity of 55%), consistent with the reported values. Using these same temperature and humidity values, we can calculate the actual heat index to have been 123 \u2218F at O'Hare (5 \u2218F higher than reported by the NWS) and 141 \u2218F at Midway (17 \u2218F higher than reported by the NWS). Like the original heat index, each value of the extended heat index maps one-to-one to thermoregulatory states (Lu and Romps 2022). For the extreme HI values in the Midwest during the July 2011 and July 1995 heat waves, a healthy adult walking in the shade would have been stressed physiologically in an effort to maintain a healthy core temperature: their body would need to sweat profusely (dripping sweat) and maintain a rapid rate of blood flow to the skin. This high blood flow would be needed to maintain an elevated skin temperature to ensure that the skin loses net energy to the environment at the same rate that metabolic heat is added to the core. The right column of figure 5 shows the skin blood flow required to maintain a healthy core temperature at the times of the maximum heat index during the top two heat waves. Combining the model of Steadman (1979) with the skin blood flow relation from Gagge et al (1972) (see Lu and Romps 2022), the normal skin blood flow (i.e. in mild conditions) is 0.57 l min\u22121. Therefore, the dark red colors in figure 5 correspond to skin blood flows that are severalfold higher than usual, indicating a high state of physiological stress. The highest rate of skin blood flow measured in the laboratory, achieved by inducing severe thermal stress, is estimated to be around 7.8 l min\u22121 (Rowell 1974, Simmons et al 2011). In the 2011 heat wave, there are a handful of grid cells of the reanalysis that report a required skin blood flow approaching 7.8 l min\u22121 and one grid cell that exceeds that value. In contrast, the required skin blood flow implied by the NWS approximation to the heat index, shown in the left column of figure 5, never exceeds 1.3 l min\u22121 during either heat wave. Figure 5. The maximum skin blood flow required to maintain a healthy core temperature during the heat waves of (top) 17\u201322 July 2011 and (bottom) 12\u201315 July 1995 as calculated using the National Weather Service's approximation to the heat index (left) and the actual heat index (right). On the color bar, 'normal' corresponds to 0.57 l min\u22121, the resting value, and 'human limit' corresponds to 7.8 l min\u22121, the physiological limit estimated from laboratory experiments. Download figure: Standard image High-resolution image 5. Discussion Using the heat index, which has recently been extended to high heat and humidity (Lu and Romps 2022), the most physiologically stressful heat waves in the contiguous United States occur most often in the Midwest, not in the South as might be expected or previously reported (e.g. Smith et al 2013, Lyon and Barnston 2017). The finding that the Midwest is home to the most hazardous heat and humidity is manifested both in the map of the 99.9th percentile of the daily maximum heat index HI 99.9 (figure 2) and in the locations of the most severe heat waves as ranked by their exceedance of HI 99.9 (figure 3). In both the July 1995 and July 2011 heat waves, the soils of the Midwest were moist when the high pressure arrived, trapping heat and humidity in a shallow boundary layer (Kunkel et al 1996, Moser 2011). Although the ingredients of individual events can be described in this way, we are not aware of any first-principles theory for why the most severe US heat waves tend to occur preferentially in the Midwest. The calculation used by the US National Weather Service underestimates the apparent temperature in extreme heat waves by as much as twenty degrees Fahrenheit. This has real consequences for our understanding of physiological impacts. For example, during the July 1995 heat wave, the heat index at the Midway airport hit a high of 141 \u2218F. In other words, conditions in the shade at the airport felt the same as being in a room at 141 \u2218F with 1.6 kPa of water-vapor pressure (8% relative humidity at that temperature). The physiological consequence of this exposure is that the cardiovascular system must maintain a skin blood flow that is elevated by 170%. In contrast, the heat index of 124 \u2218F calculated by the NWS would imply a skin blood flow that is elevated by only 90%. As seen in the reanalysis, the discrepancy was even larger elsewhere in Illinois during the July 1995 heat wave, with the required skin blood flow elevated by 120% according to the NWS approximation, but elevated by 820% according to the actual heat index. Thus, the approximate calculation used by the NWS, and widely adopted, inadvertently downplays the health risks of severe heat waves.

        "link":"https:\/\/www.bio.org\/blogs\/biotech-changed-covid-did-covid-change-biotech",
        "text":"COVID changed our world forever\u2014no one will forget the profound effect this modern pandemic has had on our everyday lives. Thankfully, we finally see the end of the pandemic, thanks in large part to the biotechnology industry. Without its immediate and tireless work to figure out what COVID-19 was, to develop therapeutics to treat it, and to finally find a way to protect against it with several vaccines, we might still be in dire straits today. Biotech definitively changed COVID, but did the virus change our industry? Today, we speak with experts about the lasting effect the pandemic has had on biotech and what changes we expect to see permanently. The transmission and spread of COVID highlighted how intricately everything on the planet is connected\u2014the concept of \u201cOne Health.\u201d \u201cThe real basics behind the One Health concept is that the health of people, the health of animals, and the health of our environment are inextricably linked. So, changes in one affect the others,\u201d explains Dr. William Karesh, Executive Vice President for Health and Policy at the Echo Health Alliance. \u201cOne Health brings that together \u2013 rather than saying that human health and animal health, environmental health are separate and can be addressed separately, they can\u2019t be addressed separately because they interact so much.\u201d With that idea of connection and oneness comes a natural need for collaboration, which we saw first-hand in the fight against COVID-19. Cartier Esham, BIO\u2019s Chief Scientific Officer, says \u201ccompanies jumped in because they wanted to help solve the global crisis\u2026It was their challenge to meet; and they did so.\u201d And we are thankful they did. It was truly an all-hands-on deck approach. Companies in the space pivoted from research projects to help. Aaron Sato, Chief Scientific Officer of Twist Bioscience, said that the company was able to provide scientific researchers at other biotech companies with synthetic versions of the virus to study which minimized their exposure risk. Helping other companies was not a fiscal decision, but a moral one. Because of this collaboration for the public good, public opinion of the biotech industry has drastically improved. Ron Foshay of Service Research Insights says \u201cthe extraordinary effort made to develop safe and effective vaccines, one survey reported, shows that positive ratings of pharmaceutical companies went from 32% in early 2020 to 62% in early 2021. That\u2019s a really big jump.\u201d Collaboration and improved public opinion weren\u2019t the only good outcomes to come from battling COVID-19. Karesh highlights another \u2013 greater public understanding of the industry and clinical testing as a whole. And Esham hopes that the COVID-era change in clinical testing practices of bringing trials to patients will have a profound and beneficial impact on clinical trials of the future. Biotechnology has always been home to rapidly changing science, but COVID-19 fundamentally reshaped tenets of the industry in a way that will likely benefit more people.

        "text":"It\u2019s been two years since COVID-19 was officially named a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), and it seems we are finally on the edge of moving from a pandemic to an endemic. But what does this mean\u2014and what lessons can we take with us as we think about COVID-19 staying with us, or perhaps the next pandemic that may come sooner than we\u2019d like? \u201cYear 2 showed us that there's some durability to these vaccines,\u201d said Phyllis Arthur, BIO\u2019s Vice President of Infectious Diseases & Emerging Science. \u201cYear 2 showed us that we can vaccinate at younger ages, and we found that heterologous boosting could actually lead to very interesting duration protection, which is a powerful thing scientifically.\u201d \u201cAnother thing we learned in Year 2 was the power of activating messengers to talk to their specific community about vaccination is incredibly important and that that is what we need to be doing across all kinds of health care,\u201d continued Arthur. \u201cThe lack of understanding also opened the window for those who are anti-vaccine to actually take advantage of those misgivings. And people spread misinformation in communities that they weren't even a part of.\u201d It\u2019s the biggest vaccination campaign in American history\u2014but not everyone\u2019s on board.

Listen: https:\/\/t.co\/ckDrxBcU7Rpic.twitter.com\/OGqsUDZ7UQ \u2014 I Am Biotech (@IAmBiotech) April 20, 2021 \u201cWhat does the end of the pandemic look like?\u201d asked Arthur. \u201cFor me, it's the stabilization of the incidence of disease and prevalence of the strains. That change is coming [\u2026] If you can literally, generally manage the number of people who are ill and hospitalized with existing medicine and have relatively controlled, or no, breakthroughs amongst people who are vaccinated, then we are kind of where the flu is.\u201d But it is important to plan for the next pandemic now. \u201cEverybody wants to get on with the rest of their lives, and this is fine for the American people,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut the legislators and the administration needs to actually take the moment to step back and look at this and ask, what are the systems and safeguards I need to keep?\u201d Why IP protection is critical to pandemic preparedness The proposed waiver of IP for COVID vaccine technology could counteract future pandemic preparedness. While some have argued a waiver of the WTO Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement would facilitate COVID-19 vaccine development and distribution, the exact opposite is true, experts told us. We\u2019ll say it again: Waiving IP rights would compromise global vaccination efforts. \u201cThey argue that eliminating IP protections would allow any willing company to produce lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines, making them cheaper and more widely accessible in low-income nations,\u201d BIO\u2019s Dr. Michelle McMurry-Heath responded succinctly. \u201cIf true, that would be a compelling argument. But it isn\u2019t.\u201d The problem with access is not so cut and dry, BIO\u2019s Senior Manager of International Affairs, Hillary Stiss, explains: \u201cIt is not an issue of IP that is preventing people from getting vaccines particularly in Africa. Really it is issues around African healthcare systems not being able to absorb vaccines and deliver it into arms.\u201d As Hans Sauer, BIO\u2019s Deputy General Counsel and Vice President for Intellectual Property, further explained, there have been over 30 COVID vaccines developed\u2014not just the Pfizer, Modern, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines\u2014apparently without interference by anyone's patent rights. So, the idea that patents are getting in the way is incorrect. Yet the very arguments used by governments to waive COVID IP rights seem to be a red herring to deflect from problematic global north government policy, while simultaneously disrespecting the work done by the private sector to step up and address this pandemic in record time \u2013 all with the added risk of disrupting investment, as well as R&D within biotech companies that would do absolutely nothing to help safeguard against the next big pandemic. \u201cThere are certain folks who are willing to trade the next decades\u2019 innovation for access today as opposed to thinking of ways to manage access in a way that doesn't trade future innovation,\u201d noted Arthur. \u201cYou don't sell the rug out from under companies in order to do that,\u201d she continued. \u201cCompanies' memories are actually quite long and if we have another pandemic and ask companies to help after forcing them to share their trade secrets they are going to resist.

The purpose of the report is \u201cto help our partners out there \u2026 understand how we are a part of the larger ecosystem in a growing number of states,\u201d said Pete Pellerito, Senior Policy Adviser for Federal\/State Economic Development & Technology Transfer Lead at BIO. \u201cThis report really reinforces the depth and the diversity of our geographic footprint in the country.\u201d \u201cWe can build all the new buildings we want, we can bring all the new equipment we want, have all the intellectual property in place, but if we don\u2019t have the people to drive it \u2026 [all] forward, any state, any region, is going to be at a disadvantage,\u201d Pellerito continued. Ultimately, the U.S. bioscience industry employs 1.87 million people across more than 101,000 U.S. businesses. Here are just a few examples of how states are driving the bioscience economy. Biomanufacturing Biomanufacturing is a type of manufacturing that leverages biological systems for the production of commercially vital biomolecules and biomaterials for medicines, food, and beverage processing as well as industrial use. State-level measures noted in the report to advance biomanufacturing include Ohio\u2019s Advanced Manufacturing Initiative, which is a competitive grant program to encourage new advanced manufacturing project and service activity. In North Carolina, the state\u2019s Golden LEAF Biomanufacturing Training and Education Center (BTEC) provides hands-on education and training both in biomanufacturing methods as well as bioprocessing concepts. This training and education is in full compliance with cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practice), a set of regulations published by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Additionally, North Carolina provides both Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) state matching grants as well as a manufacturing sales tax exemption on equipment. Meanwhile, Connecticut has a Manufacturing Innovation Fund that offers worker training and apprenticeship programs, loans, grants, and vouchers. In addition, the state is aiming to support the creation of at least 15,000 new jobs over the next five years in advanced manufacturing, data science, and insurance technology. The importance of public-private partnership Public-private partnerships will continue to be key to the development of the bioscience industry in the United States. In Massachusetts, Harvard and MIT came together in 2021 to start building a 40,000 square foot facility to create partnerships between the biopharmaceutical sector, academia, and medical leaders to advance the development of new treatment technologies for patients. The state government of Massachusetts is involved in this effort through the Massachusetts Life Science Center. Over in Tennessee, the state has directed $2.5 million of the state\u2019s budget during the 2021-2022 fiscal year towards the development of public-private partnerships to develop animal health drug products by working with universities, which have strong veterinary medicine and agricultural programs that study animal dermatological conditions and cancers. What\u2019s next for the bioscience industry? As the 2022 elections are approaching, Pellerito stated \u201cI have never felt that support for our industry has been partisan. I think it\u2019s very bipartisan.\u201d No matter what the political winds have in store later this year, the biotech sector will continue to play an integral role in job creation and innovation across different states and regions, he said. When asked regarding what efforts are being made to advance opportunities for members of historically underrepresented communities across different states and regions, Pellerito pointed to BIO\u2019s BIOEquality Agenda, stating that increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the bioscience industry is of the utmost importance both to BIO members as well as to various academic partners. As the report makes clear, despite the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, the bioscience industry is in a strong position for continued growth. Ultimately, the success of the industry is dependent upon maintaining and expanding existing partnerships, all while creating new ones to further advance the opportunities that it provides in the communities it collaborates with and serves.",

        "text":"141 SHARES Share Tweet Photo by CDC\/Cynthia S. Goldsmith at Public Health Image Library (PHIL) The ongoing monkeypox virus outbreak began in May 2022, when the U.K. notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of a handful of confirmed cases of monkeypox. Soon, cases appeared in many other countries, and as of 9 August 2022, there have been over 40,000 confirmed cases in 94 countries, with the vast majority of confirmed cases (40,012) occurring in countries that haven\u2019t historically reported monkeypox. Due to the rapid increase in case numbers, the WHO determined that the multi-country monkeypox virus outbreak was a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 23 July 2022; a PHEIC is defined as \u201can extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response\u201d. Unlike the COVID-19 pandemic, which was caused by a previously unknown virus (SARS-CoV-2), scientists have known about the monkeypox virus since 1958. Therefore, much about the way this virus spreads and the symptoms of the disease it causes is already known. This previous knowledge, however, hasn\u2019t kept disinformation and conspiracy theories about monkeypox from appearing on social media. To clear up misconceptions about monkeypox virus and the current outbreak, Health Feedback will continue to update this explainer as we learn more about monkeypox. Contents What is the monkeypox virus? First descriptions, animal hosts, human cases The monkeypox virus is a viral zoonosis, meaning the disease is caused by a virus that is transmitted to humans from animals. Once in humans, the virus can spread via human-to-human transmission. Monkeypox virus is a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus, and other members of this genus include variola virus, which causes smallpox, and cowpox virus. The monkeypox virus was first recognized in 1959 when Acta Pathologica Microbiologica Scandinavica, a monthly medical journal now known as APMIS, published a report about outbreaks of monkeypox that occurred among captive monkeys (Cynolmolgus monkeys) kept at the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1958[1]. Despite its name, the animal reservoir of the monkeypox virus is likely not monkeys. While the definite animal reservoir remains unknown, evidence suggests that small mammals, such as squirrels and rats, play an important role in keeping the virus circulating. For instance, in a 2003 multi-state outbreak of monkeypox in the U.S., all cases of monkeypox occurred in people who had contact with pet prairie dogs that had been housed near to small mammals imported from Ghana, some of which were infected with the monkeypox virus. In 1970, a 9-month old child suspected of having smallpox in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Africa, was the first recognized case of monkeypox virus infection in humans[2]. Due to the suspicion of smallpox, a related but different disease, specimens from the child were sent to the WHO Smallpox Reference Center in Moscow, Russia, where the virus was isolated and recognized as monkeypox. According to the WHO, since 1970, 11 countries in west and central Africa have reported human cases of monkeypox. Additional but sporadic human cases have also been reported in countries outside west and central Africa since 2003, in people who had recently traveled to areas where monkeypox is endemic or who had contact with infected animals[3]. A disease is considered endemic if it\u2019s consistently present in a specific area, and monkeypox is considered endemic in Benin, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Ghana (identified in animals only before this outbreak), Ivory Coast, Liberia, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, and South Sudan. What makes the current monkeypox outbreak different is that the majority of confirmed cases in non-endemic countries have no history of travel to areas where monkeypox is endemic. While the first monkeypox case confirmed on 7 May 2022 in England occurred in an individual who had recently traveled to England from Nigeria, where the infection was believed to have happened, subsequent cases reported in England in May 2022 had \u201cno link to travel to a country where monkeypox is endemic\u201d and the same is happening in other non-endemic countries. This means that new cases of monkeypox are due to human-to-human transmission in countries that haven\u2019t historically reported monkeypox. How is monkeypox transmitted among humans? Human-to-human transmission of the monkeypox virus can occur via a few routes: there is direct skin-to-skin contact with the monkeypox rash or lesions; indirect contact with objects, fabrics (including bedding and clothes), and surfaces contaminated with the virus; and contact with respiratory secretions. While all of these are possible routes of transmission, the risk of infection varies with each form of transmission. In the current monkeypox outbreak, close physical contact during sexual activity appears to be the primary mode of transmission, particularly between men who have sex with men (MSM) in non-endemic countries. \u201cFor the most part this has been stable overtime, that the outbreak has been almost exclusively in men who have sex with men,\u201d Boris Pavlin, an epidemiologist at the WHO\u2019s Emerging Diseases Surveillance and Response, said during a WHO webinar about the outbreak on 27 July 2022. This trend is borne out in the data. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) on 21 July 2022, investigated 528 confirmed cases of monkeypox in 16 countries and found that 98% of individuals with the infection were gay or bisexual, and that in 95% of cases \u201ctransmission was suspected to have occurred through sexual activity\u201d[4]. Case profile data from the WHO, released on in 16 August 2022 report, found a similar trend: for the cases where detailed information was available, 97.2% (8,382\/8,627) of infections were in persons who identified as MSM, and in 91.0% (5,585\/6,131) of cases transmission occurred during a sexual encounter. In their report, the WHO noted that \u201cseparating transmission via skin-to-skin contact during sex and transmission via bodily fluids is not [emphasis theirs] possible\u201d. This is because, even though skin-to-skin transmission during sexual activity is the primary mode of transmission, researchers are still investigating whether the virus can be spread by semen, vaginal fluids, urine and feces. A study of samples from 12 monkeypox patients in Barcelona, Spain detected viral DNA in saliva, semen, urine and feces samples[5]. However, detecting viral DNA doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s infectious virus in these bodily fluids. So far, there has been a single report of infectious virus isolated in a semen sample taken in the early phase of infection (day six after symptom onset) from a monkeypox patient in Italy, with the authors noting that further studies are needed to better understand the \u201cpotential role of semen-driven transmission in the spreading of monkeypox infection\u201d[6]. The same WHO data from 16 August 2022 also shows that, so far, other forms of transmission, such as indirect contact via contaminated objects or respiratory droplets, haven\u2019t been major contributors of monkeypox transmission. According to WHO data from 6,131 monkeypox cases for which transmission data was available, transmission was due to a sexual encounter in 5,585 cases (91.0%), person-to-person in 409 cases (6.7%), other in 127 cases (2.1%), and contact with contaminated material in 10 cases (0.2%). This suggests that while nonsexual routes of monkeypox transmission can and do occur, they\u2019re rare. It\u2019s important to note that anyone can become infected with monkeypox, and though at the moment, the majority of cases in non-endemic countries are in MSM and the primary mode of transmission is sexual contact, this could change. In a 22 July 2022 episode of the WHO\u2019s Science in 5 webseries, WHO adviser Andy Seale said that while current efforts to stop the outbreak are focused on gay, bisexual men and other MSM, \u201cwe\u2019re also keeping a strong eye on the data to see whether the outbreak will evolve into other communities\u201d. It should also be highlighted that, for African researchers who have dealt with monkeypox, information about transmission via sexual contact is not surprising. Evidence that monkeypox could spread via sexual activity had already been observed during the large and ongoing monkeypox outbreak that began in 2017 in Nigeria. In a 2019 scientific paper about the 2017 outbreak by Ogoina et al., the authors pointed out that \u201calthough the role of sexual transmission of human monkeypox isn\u2019t established, sexual transmission is plausible in some of these patients through close skin-to-skin contact during sexual intercourse\u201d[7]. Why is monkeypox primarily impacting MSM? Monkeypox can occur in anyone, but as mentioned before in this explainer, the preponderance of cases so far have occurred in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM), leading to questions of why this is the case. Kevin Woodward, an infectious disease specialist at McMaster University, told the Canadian Broadcast Corporation that monkeypox primarily hitting the queer community is an issue of bad luck. The first cases of monkeypox outside endemic countries have been in gay men, \u201cand then primarily it\u2019s being passed from person-to-person within those sexual networks,\u201d explained Woodward. \u201cAnyone can catch monkeypox, it\u2019s spread through skin-to-skin contact, but it\u2019s just because it has emerged first in that community, and that\u2019s where some of the epidemiology lies right now\u201d. In this outbreak, sexual activity has played a large role in the transmission of monkeypox. Although sexual networks among MSM aren\u2019t different from networks in other communities, there is a core group of MSM that is more densely connected, Kai Kupferschmidt reported for Nature. Early data from the outbreak suggests that the interconnected sexual networks of MSM have lead to a spread of monkeypox primarily in this community, but as has happened with other disease outbreaks, the disease could spread to other communities. Recent debates about monkeypox transmission Two debates related to monkeypox transmission have occurred, one over whether monkeypox should be considered a sexually transmitted infection (STI) and another over whether monkeypox is airborne. We\u2019ll break down both of these debates below. STIs are infections transmitted from one person to another predominantly via sexual contact; transmission can involve vaginal, oral or anal sex, as well as intimate skin-to-skin contact. Due to the preponderance of transmissions occurring via sexual contact, this has led to a debate over whether monkeypox should be considered an STI or not. Most experts appear to agree that while monkeypox is not an STI, it is behaving like one in this outbreak. John Thornhill, one of the authors of the NEJM study that evaluated 528 cases of monkeypox and a clinical academic at Queen Mary University of London, said in a press release about the study that \u201cit is important to stress that monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted infection in the traditional sense; it can be acquired through any kind of close physical contact. However, our work suggests that most transmissions so far have been related to sexual activity\u201d[4]. The second debate over whether monkeypox is \u201cairborne\u201d appears to stem from a conflation of \u201cairborne transmission\u201d and \u201crespiratory secretions\u201d; Health Feedback has addressed the difference between these two terms in a previous claim review. In a 9 June 2022 statement, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distinguished the two thusly: \u201cThere are important differences between airborne transmission and transmission via respiratory secretions. Airborne transmission occurs when small virus particles become suspended in the air and can stay there for periods of time. These particles can spread on air currents, or sometimes even infect people who enter a room after the infected person has left. In contrast, monkeypox may be found in droplets like saliva or respiratory secretions that drop out of the air quickly. Long range (e.g., airborne) transmission of monkeypox has not been reported.\u201d As such, while transmission via respiratory secretions can happen, this type of transmission usually requires face-to-face proximity. People at a higher risk for this form of transmission include health care workers, members of the same household, and close contacts. What symptoms to look out for and how is monkeypox diagnosed? While the blister-like rash is the most notable symptom of monkeypox infection, the infection is often accompanied by general symptoms that occur with other viral infections like the flu. These can include fever, chills, swollen lymph nodes, muscle, back and joint pain, headaches, and exhaustion. The virus\u2019 incubation period can last from 3 to 21 days, during which there are no symptoms, and symptoms can last from two to four weeks. The monkeypox rash and lesions appear one to five days after the fever, have a distinct look, and progress through typical phases, although lesions in different stages can appear at the same time. However, the timeline of each phase and the size of the lesions can vary. The progression of the lesions looks like this: Sources: CDC, WHO, UK Health Security Agency. Image Credit: UK Health Security Agency. As the outbreak progresses, knowledge about monkeypox\u2019s symptomatology has progressed with it. The NEJM study by Thornhill et al. mentioned in the previous section, also looked at manifestations of monkeypox in the 528 cases, finding a number of symptoms not previously listed in case definitions of monkeypox[4]. For instance, the study found that while skin lesions occurred in 95% of cases, the number of skin lesions varied widely. In those with skin lesions, the majority had fewer than 10 lesions and 54 persons had only a single genital ulcer. \u201cWe have shown that the current international case definitions need to be expanded to add symptoms that are not currently included, such as sores in the mouth, on the anal mucosa and single ulcers,\u201d said Chloe Orkin, a professor of HIV medicine at Queen Mary University of London and one of the study\u2019s authors, in a university press release. \u201cExpanding the case definition will help doctors more easily recognize the infection and so prevent people from passing it on.\u201d Individuals who develop symptoms of the disease and\/or were a close contact of someone diagnosed with monkeypox should get tested for monkeypox. Testing involves swabbing two to three lesions, followed by a PCR test to detect the presence of the monkeypox virus. At the moment, there are no at-home tests for monkeypox and, because the test involves swabbing lesions, testing can only occur once the lesions appear; work is being done to develop tests that could detect monkeypox in other ways, such as in the saliva, but these tests aren\u2019t available at the moment. It\u2019s important to make clear that diagnosing monkeypox requires a PCR test and because other diseases can cause similar rashes and skin lesions, it\u2019s not possible to diagnose monkeypox from dermatological manifestations alone. There have been two instances where individuals on public transportation\u2013one in Madrid, Spain and the other in New York City, U.S.\u2013surreptitiously filmed or photographed other individuals with lesions, claiming these individuals had monkeypox on social media. But in both cases, the individuals photographed or filmed had neurofibromatosis, a genetic condition that causes benign tumors in the nerves and other parts of the body, including skin. These two cases demonstrate that it\u2019s not possible to diagnose someone as having monkeypox simply through skin lesions as many dermatological conditions, including acne, eczema, and plaque psoriasis, can cause similar rashes and lesions. What monkeypox vaccines are available? Currently, there are two vaccines that have been licensed in the U.S. that can be taken to prevent monkeypox: JYNNEOS, which has been licensed for both smallpox and monkeypox, and ACAM2000, which has been licensed for smallpox, but can be used against monkeypox under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) Expanded Access investigational New Drug (IND) mechanism, which allows drug products to be used outside clinical trials as long as there\u2019s informed consent. JYNNEOS, produced by Bavarian Nordic, has been approved by both the U.S FDA (in 2019) and the European Medicines Agency (in 2013). JYNNEOS is an attenuated, live, non-replicating vaccine, meaning it carries a harmless version of vaccinia virus that cannot replicate in humans but is able to elicit an immune response against both smallpox and monkeypox. ACAM2000, produced by Sanofi Pasteur Biologics Co, also uses live vaccinia virus, but the vaccine isn\u2019t delivered in a shot. Instead, a two-pronged stainless steel needle is dipped in the vaccine solution and then pricks the skin in the upper arm several times. This creates a localized infection, including a blister at the vaccination site, which then dries up as a scab, and leaves a small scar after the scab falls off. Compared to JYNNEOS, ACAM2000 causes more side effects and has more contraindications. Moreover, because ACAM2000 introduces a vaccinia virus that can replicate to some degree, properly caring the vaccination site is important for preventing the virus at the vaccination site from infecting other parts of the body and other people. While both of these vaccines are currently being given in the context of the monkeypox outbreak, the CDC has noted that: Because there are limitations in our knowledge about the effectiveness of these vaccines in the current outbreak, people who are vaccinated should continue to take steps to protect themselves from infection by avoiding close, skin-to-skin contact, including intimate contact, with someone who has monkeypox. Although both ACAM2000 and JYNNEOS can be taken to prevent monkeypox, access to these vaccines is not guaranteed due to short supplies, especially in the case of JYNNEOS. So far, only Canada, the U.S. and certain countries in Europe have placed orders and\/or have access to JYNNEOS; the U.S. also has a national stockpile of over 100 million doses of ACAM2000. To spread out the limited supplies, countries like the U.K. and Canada, are giving a single dose of JYNNEOS instead of two, and on 8 August 2022, U.S. health officials authorized a plan to give people one-fifth of the usual dose of JYNNEOS, a move that has been criticized due to the limited amount of data supporting this decision. In the rest of the world, access to vaccines is even more limited. According to information from 2016, the WHO has a physical stockpile of about 2.4 million doses of a smallpox vaccine that can be delivered by a two-pronged needle; there\u2019s an additional pledged stockpile of 31 million doses held by France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand and the U.S. However, it\u2019s unclear when or how the WHO will distribute vaccine doses, and it\u2019s very possible that inequitable distribution of vaccines, with many low-income countries being shut out of access, will occur. Are people who got the smallpox vaccines decades ago immune? A few decades ago, before smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, smallpox vaccination was routine and some individuals 40 years and older who received the smallpox vaccine have wondered whether they may be protected from monkeypox. Observational studies, which is a type of study where researchers measure an outcome but don\u2019t attempt to affect the outcome (e.g., they don\u2019t provide a treatment), have shown that vaccination against smallpox is about 85% effective in preventing monkeypox. However, this has only been shown for the first three to five years after inoculation. Immunity wanes over time, but while there\u2019s no guarantee that persons who received the smallpox vaccine decades ago will be protected from monkeypox infection, \u201cexperts believe it would still protect against severe illness,\u201d Katrine Wallace, an epidemiologist at the University of Illinois, Chicago, told Bloomberg. What treatments are available for monkeypox? Currently there are no monkeypox-specific treatments, with clinical care focused on alleviating symptoms, which can include pain that\u2019s been described as \u201cexcruciating at times\u201d, as well as managing potential complications and preventing long-term sequelae. There is one promising treatment though: the antiviral tecovirimat that has been approved for treating smallpox by the U.S. FDA, even though its safety and efficacy in humans has not been established. As explained in a NEJM perspective by Sherwat et al., this is because tecovirimat was approved via the \u201cAnimal Rule\u201d, which provides a pathway to approval for drugs that treat serious or life-threatening conditions where it wouldn\u2019t be ethical or feasible to conduct efficacy studies in humans[8]. According to this rule, while safety is established in healthy human study volunteers, efficacy is evaluated in animal studies. The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) are now developing a U.S.-based randomized control study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tecovirimat as a treatment for monkeypox and another randomized, placebo-control study of tecovirimat will be done in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Tecovirimat interferes with a protein on the surface of the monkeypox virus, keeping it from replicating normally, thus slowing down the spread of the infection. A paper by Adler et al. published in The Lancet, described the clinical features and management of monkeypox in seven patients, one of whom received tecovirimat. This patient had a shorter duration of symptoms and viral shedding compared to the other six patients, but the authors noted that they \u201care unable to say whether this was a result of treatment with tecovirimat\u201d[9]. Since the beginning of the monkeypox outbreak, the FDA has allowed tecovirimat to be used under an expanded access investigational new drug protocol and the U.K. has approved tecovirimat for the treatment of poxviruses, including smallpox and monkeypox. Tecovirimat has been authorized under \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d for the treatment of smallpox, monkeypox, and cowpox by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) since January 2022. Similar to the situation with the smallpox\/monkeypox vaccines, approving or authorizing tecovirimat as a treatment for monkeypox doesn\u2019t guarantee access to tecovirimat. In the U.S., for instance, access to tecovirimat is limited and doctors need to fill out extensive paperwork and request the drug from the government\u2019s stockpile. Because it\u2019s an investigational drug, patients also have to give informed consent in order to use tecovirimat. How dangerous is monkeypox? There are two clades of monkeypox; clade I is more deadly, with a mortality rate of up to 10%, while clade II is milder and less deadly, with a mortality rate of up to 1%. Genetic data from monkeypox cases early in the outbreak showed that cases in both the U.S. and Europe were infected with clade II. Please be aware that on 17 August 2022, the WHO renamed the two monkeypox clades; clade I was formerly known as the Congo Basin clade and clade II was formerly known as the West African clade. News articles and research papers published before this change may be using the old names. Though in many cases monkeypox is self-limiting\u2014meaning it goes away on its own, without specific treatment\u2014 in rare instances, infections can lead to medical complications and even death. In late July 2022, three countries (Brazil, Spain, and India) reported the first monkeypox deaths in non-endemic countries. Fatality rates are higher in African countries, with health officials reporting more than 70 suspected monkeypox deaths so far this year, though this number is probably undercounted due to limited testing and surveillance capacity, infectious diseases physician Dimie Ogoina of the Niger Delta University, Nigeria, told Nature.

        "text":"CLAIM \u201c[T]he peak of vaccine mandates in America [\u2026] coincides with massive excess mortality among people in the prime of life\u201d more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: Mark Steyn, GB News, 24 Aug. 2022 DETAILS Inadequate support: Steyn claimed that sudden deaths among young people increased in 2021 based on anecdotal evidence and data that are either preliminary or don't support such a claim. There is also no evidence suggesting a link between COVID-19 vaccines and cases of sudden death. Flawed reasoning: Steyn\u2019s claim that countries with low COVID-19 vaccination rates had lower excess deaths than those with high vaccination rates relies on a correlation that only holds for July 2022. He failed to account for other factors that also directly impact mortality which differ between countries, such as healthcare capacity and demographic differences. KEY TAKE AWAY Scientific evidence overwhelmingly shows that COVID-19 vaccines are very safe and highly effective at reducing the risk of severe illness and death. No evidence suggests an association between COVID-19 vaccines and sudden death in young people. On the contrary, analyses comparing the proportion of deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals indicate that COVID-19 vaccines actually reduce the risk of all-cause death. FULL CLAIM: \u201cAnything going on in the third quarter of 2021? Well, that was actually the peak of vaccine mandates in America [\u2026] And oddly enough, that coincides with massive excess mortality among people in the prime of life\u201d REVIEW On 24 August 2022, Mark Steyn, a host on GB News, a television and radio channel in the United Kingdom, claimed that young, healthy people died at a higher rate in 2021 than in previous years. Steyn suggested a link between this alleged increase in mortality and COVID-19 vaccination, although he didn\u2019t state this out loud. The video received more than 230,000 views and 16,000 interactions on Youtube, and over 7,000 interactions on Facebook. GB News also shared the video on Twitter, where it received more than 500,000 views and 11,000 interactions. To support his claim, Steyn cited cases of young people who died of cardiac arrest in the U.K. and mortality data from Canada, the U.S., and Europe, purportedly demonstrating higher mortality in 2021 compared to previous years. While the data he used is accurate, Steyn\u2019s claims are misleading and based on incorrect interpretations and speculations that lack scientific support, as we explain below. This isn\u2019t the first time Steyn spread misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines. According to the Guardian, the U.K. Office of Communications opened an investigation into Steyn in July 2022 for falsely claiming that people who had received a vaccine booster were three times more likely to die from COVID-19 than people who had received two doses or fewer. The fact-checking organization Full Fact explained that Steyn\u2019s claim is inaccurate and based on a flawed interpretation of vaccine surveillance data. Scientific evidence indicates that COVID-19 vaccination reduces the risk of death Steyn correlated June 2022 excess mortality data from Eurostat\u2014the statistical office of the European Union\u2014and COVID-19 vaccination rates from the website Statista as of August 2022. Based on these data, he claimed that countries with low COVID-19 vaccination rates, such as Bulgaria, Slovakia, and Hungary, had lower excess mortality than those with higher vaccination rates, including Portugal, Spain, and Estonia. Steyn specifically highlighted the case of Bulgaria, which he claimed had \u201cthe least excess mortality\u201d despite being \u201cthe least vaccinated country in Europe\u201d. As Health Feedback explained in earlier reviews, such correlations are oversimplified and highly misleading because they fail to account for other factors that also directly affect mortality, called confounding factors, that differ from country to country. These factors include differences in the epidemiological situation, healthcare capacity, as well as demographic differences like the health condition and age distribution of the population. Without accounting for the effect of these variables, such correlations don\u2019t provide meaningful information about the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on mortality. Steyn\u2019s correlations also didn\u2019t take into account the fact that countries have a mixture of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. By attributing the excess deaths directly to COVID-19 vaccination, Steyn\u2019s underlying assumption is that the people who died must have been vaccinated. But this is a baseless assumption as there is no evidence to show that this is the case nor did Steyn present such evidence. This is known as the ecological fallacy. Furthermore, Steyn\u2019s claim is fundamentally flawed because he only considered the excess mortality in June 2022 compared with the average from between 2016 to 2019. These data don\u2019t reflect the effect of vaccination on mortality during the worst peaks of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. If we focus on 2021, after the European Union granted market authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, we see that the excess mortality in Bulgaria, Slovakia, and Hungary was much higher than in Spain, Portugal, and Estonia (Figure 1). In November 2021, Bulgaria\u2019s excess mortality was 50% higher compared to pre-pandemic levels, which was the highest excess mortality in the European Union at that time, as reported by Reuters. Figure 1. Excess mortality by month during 2021. Values (Y axis) are expressed as the percentage of additional deaths in a month compared to the average number of deaths in the same month over a baseline period. Bulgaria (green line), Hungary (orange line), and Slovakia (black line) show the highest excess mortality peaks, around January 2021 and November 2021. Source: Eurostat. Therefore, Steyn\u2019s claim that the least vaccinated countries have the lowest excess mortality applies exclusively to June 2022, but is clearly false for the two major COVID-19 waves in 2021, when countries with low vaccine coverage experienced much larger excess deaths than highly vaccinated countries. Contrary to what Steyn suggested, a study comparing the proportion of deaths based on the vaccination status of the individuals showed that COVID-19 vaccination is associated with a lower risk of all-cause death. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention evaluated non-COVID-19 mortality among 6.4 million vaccinated and 4.6 million unvaccinated persons[1]. The study found that those who received any of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the U.S. (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson) were up to three times less likely to die from any cause than those who didn\u2019t receive the vaccine. Leading causes of death in Alberta, Canada, in 2021 are still preliminary; claims that deaths due to \u201cunknown causes\u201d spiked in 2021 are currently unsupported Steyn used a graph showing the \u201cchange in unknown causes of death\u201d in Alberta, Canada, from 2019 to 2021 to claim that unknown causes was the leading cause of death in that province in 2021. The data, released by Alberta\u2019s Open Government portal on 30 June 2022, show that the number of deaths classified as unknown causes did increase from 2019 (522) to 2020 (1,464) and almost doubled in 2021 (3,362). However, Steyn\u2019s claim is currently unsupported because definite data on leading causes of death in Canada is only available for 2020 and earlier. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems by the World Health Organization defines Other ill-defined and unknown causes of mortality as \u201cdeaths with symptoms, signs, and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified\u201d. But this category also includes deaths that are still under investigation, as the press secretary to Service Alberta explained in an email to CTV News: \u201cThe \u2018other ill-defined and unknown cause of death\u2019 classification is given when a cause of death cannot be determined, or when a death is still under investigation with a medical examiner. Some deaths originally coded in this way are updated as final determination of cause of death are determined\u201d In other words, a proportion of the deaths classified as unknown causes are based on provisional data that keep being updated as the territories determine the cause of death and report it. In fact, the press secretary pointed out to CTV News that the total number of deaths coded as unknown causes in 2021 as of 6 July 2022 was actually 35% lower than previously published in 2021. Therefore, Steyn\u2019s claim that deaths of unknown causes in Alberta spiked in 2021 and were the leading cause of death is premature and there is currently not enough information to confirm or refute his claim. A large proportion of the excess deaths in 2021 are attributable to COVID-19; no evidence suggests that COVID-19 vaccines played any role Steyn further suggested that the alleged increase in mortality was mostly driven by young people, based on data from a mortality report published in August 2022 by the U.S. Society of Actuaries. Table 5.7 (page 23) of the report shows a 37% increase in mortality in the third quarter of 2021, mostly attributable to a mortality spike among people aged 25 to 54. However, the insinuation that COVID-19 vaccines are responsible for this excess in mortality is baseless. AP News and PolitiFact evaluated a similar claim in early 2022 and found it to be false. They explained that a high proportion of the excess deaths can be directly attributed to COVID-19, which was the third leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2021. In addition, COVID-19 might have been indirectly responsible for many of the non-COVID-19 deaths, for example, due to delayed medical tests or treatments. Steyn reinforced the idea that unexplained deaths are spiking among young people using four cases of young athletes\u2014a bike rider, a boxer, a rugby player, and a football player\u2014who died in the U.K. of sudden cardiac arrest. \u201cFit, healthy, in the peak of condition and dead. But nothing to see here,\u201d Steyn claimed. Steyn also cited the example of a woman from Ontario, Canada, who died while jet skiing. He highlighted that she was a paramedic, stating that this meant \u201csomething can be inferred\u201d. Steyn didn\u2019t tell viewers what this \u201csomething\u201d was, but it is likely a reference to COVID-19 vaccine mandates for Ontario healthcare staff, including paramedics, further implying a link between these sudden deaths and vaccination. Claims that COVID-19 vaccines are behind sudden deaths of young, healthy people went viral in late 2021. Such claims may be partly based on the association between mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and a small increase in the risk of heart inflammation in adolescents and young adults, which some incorrectly linked to cases of sudden arrhythmia death syndrome (SADS). According to the SADS Foundation, SADS is the result of genetic mutations that disrupt the electrical system regulating the pumping action of the heart. This can lead to abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) and sudden cardiac arrest in young, apparently healthy people under the age of 40. However, no evidence suggests an association between COVID-19 vaccines and SADS, as Health Feedback and other fact-checking organizations like PolitiFact and FactCheck.org explained. Furthermore, getting COVID-19 itself is much more likely to cause heart complications than getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Getting COVID-19 also exposes people to other, known health problems like long COVID. In fact, the SADS Foundation recommends that people with SADS conditions receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Contrary to what Steyn suggested, a March 2022 analysis by the U.K. Office of National Statistics found no evidence of a change in the number of cardiac-related deaths or deaths occurring from any cause following COVID-19 vaccination in young people aged 12 to 29 years in 2021. Conclusion Steyn\u2019s insinuation that healthy people are dying at a higher rate than in previous years and COVID-19 vaccines are to blame is based on flawed analyses and is unsupported by the data he provided. Although he concluded by stating that, \u201cBut altogether now, correlation is not causation\u201d, this doesn\u2019t change the substance of the overall narrative he presented in the video: that COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous and associated with sudden deaths among young people. As we demonstrated in this review, his narrative is unsupported by scientific evidence, which shows that vaccinating against COVID-19 reduces the risk of severe illness and death. Update (4 November 2022): The statement \u201cstudies comparing the proportion of deaths based on the vaccination status of the individuals show that COVID-19 vaccines reduce the risk of all-cause death\u201d was corrected to: \u201ca study comparing the proportion of deaths based on the vaccination status of the individuals showed that COVID-19 vaccination is associated with a lower risk of all-cause death\u201d. This correction did not alter the verdict on the claim. REFERENCES",

Written by Marty Makary, a professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, the article received more than 220,000 interactions and 37,000 shares on Facebook, according to the social media analytics tool CrowdTangle. Its claim was also propagated through social media posts by other outlets, such as this video by former U.S. Representative Ron Paul and this article by Zero Hedge, labeled a \u201cconspiracy-pseudoscience\u201d source by Media Bias\/Fact Check. Herd immunity is a state in which a certain proportion of individuals in a population are immune to an infectious disease. As explained in this article by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health: \u201cFor example, if 80% of a population is immune to a virus, four out of every five people who encounter someone with the disease won\u2019t get sick (and won\u2019t spread the disease any further). In this way, the spread of infectious diseases is kept under control. Depending how contagious an infection is, usually 50% to 90% of a population needs immunity to achieve herd immunity.\u201d The headline\u2019s claim is built in large part on the assumption that \u201c55% of Americans have natural immunity\u201d to COVID-19 through prior infection. However, experts who reviewed the article told Health Feedback that this assumption wasn\u2019t supported by the data. [See our reviewers\u2019 overall feedback.] Marm Kilpatrick, a professor at the University of California Santa Cruz who studies disease ecology, found that the article\u2019s figures for the number of COVID-19 infections detected by testing, as well as the infection fatality rate\u2014which measures the proportion of infected people who die from the disease\u2014were unsubstantiated. Kilpatrick explained that the proportion of COVID-19 infections detected by testing is unknown, since there are no representative serosurveys available for the U.S. Serosurveys, or seroprevalence studies, measure the proportion of people who have antibodies to a pathogen. These studies inform researchers about the extent of a pathogen\u2019s spread in a population. \u201cThe author uses a value of 15.4 percent (1\/6.5), which produces a very different answer than if the author had used his other proposed value of 25 percent (1\/4),\u201d Kirkpatrick pointed out. \u201cInstead of the 55 percent seroprevalence claimed, seroprevalence would be 34 percent. The fraction of infections detected by testing may even be higher than 25 percent, which would produce an even lower estimate of seroprevalence.\u201d The article also extrapolated the total number of COVID-19 infections by relying on the infection fatality rate and the total number of deaths. However, the article underestimated the infection fatality rate. Given a fixed number of deaths, the higher the infection fatality rate, the smaller the size of the infected population. \u201cThe best available data for the U.S. population indicates a value of 0.6,\u201d Kilpatrick said, citing a study by O\u2019Driscoll et al.[1]. \u201cUsing the same number of deaths as the author\u201d, which is 0.15 percent of the U.S. population, this would translate to 25 percent of the U.S. population having been infected, \u201crather than two-thirds as the author claimed.\u201d In short, the article\u2019s statement that \u201c55 \u2013 66 percent of the U.S. population has already been infected and has immunity is not supported by available data,\u201d he concluded. Apart from the miscalculations in the total number of infections, the article also made several inaccurate assertions about COVID-19 reinfections and immunity. Tara Smith, an epidemiologist and professor at Kent State University, refuted the article\u2019s claim that \u201cwhen [reinfections] do occur, the cases are mild\u201d, citing a case report documenting COVID-19 cases around the world that were more serious upon reinfection[2]. Virologist Angela Rasmussen pointed out that the article misrepresented a study by Sekine et al. on T cells[3]: \u201cT cell immunity is presented [in the Wall Street Journal opinion piece] as being an indicator of protective immunity [\u2026] this is an incorrect interpretation of the data cited about T cells to support that assertion\u201d. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and professor of molecular medicine at the Scripps Research Institute, highlighted several problems with the opinion piece in a Twitter thread: No, we won't. A deeply flawed oped https:\/\/t.co\/xkAQKU1hg6 \u201455% of Americans do not have natural immunity \u20142\/3 of the US population has not had covid \u2014Wrong on T-cell protection \u2014Very high Brazil infection rate was not protective \u2014150M will not be vaccinated by March end pic.twitter.com\/NLGVnUJv2Y \u2014 Eric Topol (@EricTopol) February 18, 2021 William Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, pointed out that the article\u2019s use of the Brazilian city of Manaus as a real-life example of successful protection through natural infection is inaccurate and misleading. \u201cThe article fails to mention that since the research it cites was published, Manaus has suffered a surge of infections even worse than the one that it saw at the start of the pandemic[4],\u201d he said. As reported in a study by Buss et al.[5], even though an estimated 76 percent of Manaus\u2019 population was infected, the spread of COVID-19 wasn\u2019t halted. In fact, news reports indicated that a second wave of infections overwhelmed hospitals in early 2021. Buss et al. warned that \u201cManaus represents a \u2018sentinel\u2019 population, giving us a data-based indication of what may happen if SARS-CoV-2 is allowed to spread largely unmitigated.\u201d Curiously, the Lancet commentary cited in the opinion piece to support the claim actually reported COVID-19 resurgence in Manaus despite the high level of infection in its population[4]. This contradicts the Wall Street Journal article\u2019s suggestion that Manaus had achieved protection through natural infection. One reason for the resurgence may be the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants[4,6], although other factors, such as waning population immunity, may also be a contributing factor. \u201cIt is not known to what extent the circulating variant P.1 contributed to the surge, or how many cases were reinfections, but it should be more than enough to demonstrate the dangers of trusting to \u2018herd immunity\u2019 from infection for protection,\u201d Hanage said. Cases in the U.S. have indeed been falling in recent weeks. The reason for this is still unclear, but this Washington Post article explored several possible explanations. Apart from vaccinations, other potential contributing factors that scientists highlighted were changes in people\u2019s behavior, such as greater adherence to physical distancing and the use of face masks, as well as fewer COVID-19 tests being performed due to a shift in focus from testing to vaccinating. However, an analysis of the number of cases and positivity rate in this Health Feedback review indicated that the decrease is genuine and not simply due to fewer tests being performed. In summary, the Wall Street Journal opinion piece\u2019s claim that the U.S. will achieve herd immunity by April 2021 is unsupported by the available data. Its claim that natural infection confers sufficient herd immunity to end the COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S. also doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny, when we consider the example of Manaus. The city experienced a largely uncontrolled spread of COVID-19, which resulted in a high infection rate. Yet the city still saw a resurgence of COVID-19 that was worse than the first wave. While the U.S. is indeed experiencing a fall in the number of new COVID-19 cases, scientists have urged Americans to avoid complacency given the threat posed by the new virus variants. Masks, distancing, ventilation, avoiding gatherings, getting vaccinated when eligible. These are the tools we have to continue the long trip down the tall mountain. The variants may throw us a curve ball, but if we keep driving down transmission we can get to a better place. 7\/7 \u2014 Caitlin Rivers, PhD (@cmyeaton) February 4, 2021 Former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tom Frieden told CNN: \u201cWe\u2019ve had three surges. Whether or not we have a fourth surge is up to us, and the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher.\u201d You can read the original Wall Street Journal article here. SCIENTISTS\u2019 OVERALL FEEDBACK A. Marm Kilpatrick, Professor, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California Santa Cruz: The article\u2019s claim that the U.S. is near herd immunity rests on two numbers: 1) the detection of infections by testing (claimed to be 10 \u2013 25 percent) and 2) the infection fatality rate (claimed to be 0.23 percent). 1) The fraction of infections detected by testing is unknown, as there are no representative serosurveys for the U.S. on which to quantify this number. The author uses a value of 15.4 percent (1\/6.5), which produces a very different answer than if the author had used his other proposed value of 25 percent (1\/4). Instead of the 55 percent seroprevalence claimed, seroprevalence would be 34 percent. The fraction of infections detected by testing may even be higher than 25 percent, which would produce an even lower estimate of seroprevalence. 2) The infection fatality rate is an age-specific value that also depends on gender and pre-existing morbidities. The best available data for the U.S. population indicates a value of 0.6 (95% CI: 0.51-0.7), which comes from Figure 2 of this study by O\u2019Driscoll et al.[1]. Using the same number of deaths as the author indicates that 0.15%\/0.6% = 25% of the U.S. population has been infected, rather than two-thirds as the author claims. Thus, the author\u2019s argument that 55 \u2013 66 percent of the U.S. population has already been infected and has immunity is not supported by available data. Tara Smith, Professor, College of Public Health, Kent State University: There are a lot of errors here, probably because the author has no background in infectious disease. The author of the T cell research cited says it\u2019s misused (see that and more info in this Twitter thread). And not all reinfections are mild[2]. William Hanage, Associate Professor of Epidemiology, Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health: This is not an exhaustive list. The estimates of how many have been infected do not tally with those of others (for example, see this analysis of attack rate). But because these numbers inevitably lag, the best way to show this is probably the section where the national per capita mortality is used to estimate how many people have been infected. In reality, this statistic varied hugely by state, with more than 2500\/million dead in New Jersey, less than 1000\/million in Virginia, and about 300\/million in Hawaii. This suggests great regional differences in the amount of infection that has occurred and the resulting immunity. Note that the role of the holidays in producing a peak is illustrated by the fact that Hawaii saw a small peak around the same time as the rest of the country in early January, despite having little evidence of immunity and a very different climate. While cases are down nationally, in some regions\u2014including some with very high per capita mortality rates\u2014they are showing signs of plateauing. There are numerous misstatements about the weight of evidence when it comes to reinfections. It should be noted that if your bar for reinfections is two PCR tests with a genome from each, that makes them very hard to detect\u2014even more so when, as the article states, many initial infections are never detected! Probably the best single counterpoint is the example of Manaus, which is held up in the article as an example of herd immunity. The article fails to mention that since the research it cites was published, Manaus has suffered a surge of infections even worse than the one that it saw at the start of the pandemic[4,5]. It is not known to what extent the circulating variant P.1 contributed to the surge, or how many cases were reinfections, but it should be more than enough to demonstrate the dangers of trusting to \u201cherd immunity\u201d from infection for protection. The article\u2019s statement that \u201cmost infections are asymptomatic\u201d is not true[7]. Finally, the arrival of the B.1.1.7 variant which is approximately 50% more transmissible means that a larger proportion of the population needs to be immune to drop the reproductive number below one[8]. While April may well be considerably better than the worst of the winter, this should be placed in the context of seasonality[9]. Overemphasizing population immunity is misleading and could discourage people from vaccination. REFERENCES",

Authored by Robert Malone, a scientist who formerly worked at the Salk Institute in the field of molecular biology, and Peter Navarro, an economist who served as the Director of the White House National Trade Council during the Trump administration, the opinion piece received more than 12,000 engagements on Facebook, including more than 4,800 shares, according to CrowdTangle, a social media analytics tool. The article also received some user engagements on Twitter and Reddit. Malone and Navarro claimed that universal vaccination was based on four \u201cflawed assumptions\u201d, namely that: 1) universal vaccination can eradicate the virus, 2) the COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, 3) the COVID-19 vaccines are safe and 4) vaccine-mediated immunity is durable. The key argument made by Malone and Navarro as to the imprudence of a universal vaccination strategy\u2014in fact pursued by many other countries besides the U.S., despite the article\u2019s headline\u2014is that this would create an evolutionary \u201carms race\u201d, leading to the accelerated generation of vaccine-resistant variants. [Editor\u2019s note: Navarro went on to repeat the same claims in a Newsmax article published in November 2021.] Experts who reviewed the opinion piece found it to be inaccurate and misleading. They explained that Malone and Navarro\u2019s assertions of \u201cflawed assumptions\u201d about universal vaccination were themselves wrong. [See scientists\u2019 full comments.] Ang\u00e9line Rouers, an immunologist and research fellow at the Infectious Diseases Labs of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research in Singapore, told Health Feedback that the argument by Malone and Navrro isn\u2019t grounded in scientific evidence. It is not widespread vaccination that promotes mutations and leads to \u201cexposure to more and more risk\u201d, she said. \u201cOn the contrary, the rapid vaccination of as many people as possible is crucial to stop the variants. The virus mutates, not because of vaccination but because it is a virus, and every virus in the world can mutate.\u201d Emma Hodcroft, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bern and co-developer of Nextstrain, a project which tracks the evolution of viruses including SARS-CoV-2, highlighted the fallacy of the argument. \u201cAny type of immunity present in the population will provide a selection pressure for the virus to get around this immunity, if it can,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not just vaccine immunity which provides this selection pressure: immunity from infection does as well.\u201d Indeed, of the four existing variants of concern to date, all four emerged in 2020, long before the start of public vaccination campaigns. In particular, the Delta variant, which has been making headlines around the world, was first detected in October 2020. This observation demonstrates that halting vaccination efforts won\u2019t stop the emergence of virus variants\u2014after all, variants are entirely capable of emerging in the absence of vaccination. In addition, Malone and Navarro misleadingly cited the risk of side effects from the COVID-19 vaccines as a reason why universal vaccination wasn\u2019t optimal. Dale Fisher, a professor of medicine at the National University of Singapore who specializes in infectious diseases, refuted this notion. \u201cIt is very clear that the risks of vaccination are much lower than the risks of COVID-19,\u201d he said. \u201cThe article\u2019s discussion surrounding virologists\u2019 fears, unreferenced or substantiated, likewise is unhelpful fear-mongering when already many long-term effects of the disease itself are emerging and much more likely.\u201d Fisher also found Malone and Navarro\u2019s claim regarding the \u201cdecided lack of durability\u201d of vaccine-mediated immunity to be unsubstantiated. Similarly, Rouers also pointed out that the article failed to provide any evidence or sources to support any of its claims. She found the article\u2019s suggestion that the \u201cfar more optimal strategy is to vaccinate only the most vulnerable\u201d to be \u201cnonsense\u201d. Some of those at high risk from COVID-19, like people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients and organ transplant recipients, \u201ccannot receive the full benefits of vaccination due to their medical history and will rely on indirect protection through the vaccination of others around them (i.e. herd immunity),\u201d she said. All three reviewers agreed that variants with immune escape abilities would always remain a possibility, with or without vaccines. \u201cNo matter what action we take, we have a future where we will have to deal with a virus responding to immune pressure,\u201d Hodcroft said. Scientists are well aware of this possibility and the dangers this poses, and measures are in place to mitigate the harm this can cause. Fisher cited genetic surveillance efforts as a top priority globally to observe for the emergence of escape mutants, which future versions of COVID-19 vaccines may need to cater for. But even if the evolution of immune escape remains a concern with or without vaccines, how we choose to confront this problem will lead to significantly different outcomes for public health and the virus\u2019 ability to outsmart the immune system, Hodcroft pointed out. There\u2019s no doubt that high population immunity can be achieved through infection, but this goes hand in hand with needless suffering and death that vaccination would prevent. It would also offer the virus much more opportunities to acquire mutations. On the other hand, vaccination gives us an edge in the game, by reducing transmission rates while achieving a high level of population immunity. By reducing transmission and in turn infection, we deprive the virus of opportunities to acquire new mutations that make it more dangerous or transmissible. You can read the original Washington Times article here. SCIENTISTS\u2019 OVERALL FEEDBACK: Emma Hodcroft, Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Basel: I will comment primarily on the claims about evolution and mutation in the context of vaccination or widespread infection. I\u2019m not a medical doctor, and so even though their claims about vaccine harms and drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine aren\u2019t consistent with the published literature and reports by governments, I will not comment on this. Viruses are some of the fastest-evolving pathogens we know, which is part of what makes them so tricky. For instance, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) evolves so quickly that our immune systems can\u2019t keep up with \u201crecognizing\u201d it. That\u2019s part of why it\u2019s a chronic\u2014and if untreated, fatal\u2014disease. For most human viruses we encounter, however, the outcome is much less grim. Our bodies learn to recognise it, which protects us from infection and\/or serious outcomes when we meet it again in the future. However, for many viruses this is a dance we participate in for the rest of our lives\u2014though we learn to recognise what infects us, the virus will change, and we may not recognise it as well next time. In some cases, we may remain protected for the rest of our non-frail lives from serious outcomes, but not from infection itself, with or without mild symptoms. Any type of immunity present in the population will provide a selection pressure for the virus to get around this immunity, if it can. In many cases however, and particularly for viruses like coronaviruses, evidence suggests that this escape is usually not complete, particularly over shorter time periods. This means that even if you get infected, you benefit from \u201cimperfect immunity\u201d by being protected against severe outcomes. We see this reflected in what we have learned from SARS-CoV-2 vaccination data. This means that even when viruses have selection pressure on them from population immunity, it is not correct to assume, as the article does (\u201cever more powerful vaccines will have to be developed\u201d), that just because we may see some level of immune escape, this means that booster vaccines will be needed forever, or beyond the most vulnerable, or very frequently. But most importantly, it\u2019s not only vaccine immunity which provides this selection pressure: immunity from infection does as well, despite the impression given by the article (\u201cThe more people you vaccinate, the greater the number of vaccine-resistant mutations you are likely to get\u201d). In fact, it is hypothesized that some of the variants we have already seen, with some apparent immune escape like Gamma, arose in places where previous infection levels (and thus infection-mediated immunity) were high, and thus this may have put pressure for immune escape. Thus no matter what action we take, we have a future where we will have to deal with a virus responding to immune pressure, whether through most of the population being infected eventually\u2014and with more transmissible variants like Delta as well as reopening, we can see this future clearly in the huge waves in areas with low vaccination rates\u2014through vaccine-mediated immunity, or through a combination of both. What\u2019s key is that there\u2019s a huge difference in how you reach these two goals. The risks of vaccination are incredibly low, particularly for the mRNA vaccines, and means we can keep the transmission rates of the virus low *while* getting high population immunity. On the other hand, we know that SARS-CoV-2 has very real risks for many people in our population. Even for age groups where the risk is relatively low, if you infect millions of people, you will see bad outcomes. Allowing the entire population to be infected\u2014even excluding the most vulnerable\u2014will cause a lot of hospitalizations, deaths, and suffering along the way, which is entirely preventable through vaccination. Finally, population-level immunity achieved through infection requires, by definition, high levels of virus transmission. This provides the most opportunity for the virus to find itself in people with the imperfect immunity where immune-avoiding mutations could be selected. On the other hand, vaccine-mediated immunity could be achieved with zero virus circulating. While that extreme may not be realistic, we can achieve it while keeping virus levels very low, minimizing the chance that the virus has to have these mutations selected for. While it\u2019s true that except for eliminating SARS-CoV-2 entirely, we cannot entirely stop the virus from developing escape mutations, we can make this much harder. Even when vaccine-mediated immunity is imperfect, evidence suggests it makes it harder to be infected and harder to transmit\u2014these are opportunities we take away from the virus. Further, it may be that those who may be vaccinated & infected may be able to eliminate the virus faster from the body, or have fewer viruses circulating while infected\u2014all of which remove more opportunities for dangerous mutation. In short, there is no future in which we won\u2019t have to potentially face mutations that escape immunity to some degree. However, the future that is much less risky is reached by minimizing the chance of these mutations and minimizing the risk by which we achieve population-level immunity, and that\u2019s through vaccination. Finally, to address this quote: \u201cThe clear historical tendency for viruses crossing over from one species to another is to evolve in a way that makes them both more infectious and less pathogenic over time.\u201d In fact, there is no clear historical tendency. Is HIV less fatal? Influenza? The base fallacy here is that any virus that kills some hosts sometimes is under strong selection never to kill at all, when actually the selection is at the far end, which the authors illustrate that they recognize: \u201cA virus can\u2019t efficiently spread if, like with Ebola, it quickly kills its hosts.\u201d\u2014if it kills before it transmits. But if the virus transmits before it kills, it does not much care what happens to the host. Particularly, as is the case with SARS-CoV-2, when transmission has many opportunities (SARS-CoV-2 is respiratory, whereas Ebola spreads through fluids), death takes weeks (plenty of time to transmit), and occurs in a relatively (from the virus\u2019 point of view) small number of infections. Even in cases where viruses may be under selection to become less deadly (which does not seem obvious for SARS-CoV-2), \u201cless deadly\u201d does not equal \u201cnot deadly\u201d\u2014they may simply evolve to kill you after four weeks instead of four days, for example, or kill 15% rather than 30%. Further, a lot of the \u201cattenuation\u201d we may observe for viruses over time, for those where we estimate they jumped into humans relatively recently, is likely due instead to immunity. A virus that is very dangerous at the first exposure is likely less dangerous once the entire population has some level of immunity, which in the past would have been after everyone had been infected). Exposure at different ages also makes a difference. As we see with SARS-CoV-2, young children seem at relatively little risk. If everyone was exposed as a child (as they are to many, many other viruses, like influenza and seasonal coronaviruses), the virus may be inconsequential for almost the rest of their lives (old age seems to make people more vulnerable to respiratory viruses). But this is through early exposure and immunity (and possibly repeated exposure), not through the virus becoming less virulent. Dale Fisher, Professor (Department of Medicine), National University of Singapore: This article has inaccuracies throughout with a clear view to push an anti-vaccine agenda. The picture depicting a skull with eyes and nose made of coronaviruses in the shape of the U.S. is sensationalist. The opening line calls it Biden\u2019s strategy. It was also Trump\u2019s and is the strategy of every country and the WHO. Flawed assumption #1 in the article is wrong. No one believes the virus will be eradicated. It\u2019s also not about herd immunity. It\u2019s about turning this into a mild illness and reducing transmission. Flawed assumption #2 stemming from the first: No one believes it\u2019s perfect. We know transmission continues. Everything else is true and this is built into the strategies. Flawed assumption #3: Again, no one denies the risk of side effects. Indeed the scientific community and national authorities globally have been clear in discussing thrombotic, cardiomyopathic, and anaphylactic risks. It is very clear that the risks of vaccination are much lower than the risks of COVID-19. The article\u2019s discussion surrounding virologists\u2019 fears (unreferenced or substantiated) likewise is unhelpful fear-mongering when already many long-term effects of the disease itself are emerging and much more likely. Flawed assumption #4: There is no good evidence yet that the lack of durability exists. If it is true, we may find that some vaccines are more durable than others and even future generations of vaccines could be better. No one is saying we don\u2019t have more to learn and that R&D has stopped. It is true however that boosters may be necessary. It is theoretically possible that variants could escape vaccine-related immunity, but all the variants of concern to date have shown increased transmissibility, and in some cases, immune escape in the absence of vaccines. The rest of the conjecture is just that: conjecture. Genetic surveillance has a high priority globally to observe for the emergence of escape mutants, and yes, future versions of the vaccine may need to cater for these. Malone and Navarro\u2019s list of \u201cnumerous other useful treatments\u201d is not consistent with the findings of most clinical trials and is not standard practice. Ang\u00e9line Rouers, Senior Research Fellow, A*STAR Infectious Diseases Labs: The article does not mention any source to support the claims. The only reference at the end is the fact that one author was the \u201cdiscoverer of the mRNA vaccine\u201d (which is an exaggerated claim) and that the other served in the White House as the Defense Production Act Policy Coordinator during the Trump administration. Neither of these statements offer support for the scientific claims they make in the article. To clarify the main claims and put the things at the right place: About assumption 1 in the article: There is a confusion about the relationship between vaccination and mutations. The massive vaccination of the population doesn\u2019t promote mutations and lead to \u201cexposure to more and more risk\u201d. On the contrary, the rapid vaccination of as many people as possible is crucial to stop the variants. The virus mutates not because of vaccination but because it is a virus, and every virus in the world can mutate. Some of the mutations make the virus stronger and sometimes more transmissible. Some vaccines may become useless against certain variants but for now\u2014even if it is demonstrated that there is a reduction in neutralizing activity against the variants\u2014vaccines are still effective. But if not enough people are vaccinated, the variants will continue to emerge. The massive immunisation\u2014through vaccination\u2014will stop the variant race, not elicit it! About assumption 2 in the article: All vaccines come with side effects. There is always the risk-benefit balance to take into account. In the context of COVID-19 vaccines, the eventual side effects observed remain very rare and don\u2019t reach an abnormal rate that justifies halting their use. Adverse events such as the disruption of women\u2019s menstrual cycle have been rarely observed, and up until now, not shown to be causally linked to vaccination. However, when these observations are made, scientists are encouraged to investigate more in detail to rule out all possible links. It is true that certain kinds of vaccines can lead to unexpected reactions depending on the medical history of the individual. That\u2019s why this history or current health condition of the subject, such as pregnancy, is always taken into account when deciding which vaccine to give. Allergic reactions are recognized as a possible side effect, but people are closely monitored for this reaction after vaccination. About assumption 3 in the article: Vaccination of the most vulnerable only sounds like a nonsense strategy. Some of them cannot receive the full benefits of vaccination due to their medical history and will rely on indirect protection through the vaccination of others around them. That\u2019s the principle of herd immunity. ANNOTATIONS The statements quoted below are from the article; comments are from the reviewers (and are lightly edited for clarity). \u201cThe more people you vaccinate, the greater the number of vaccine-resistant mutations you are likely to get, the less durable the vaccines will become, ever more powerful vaccines will have to be developed, and individuals will be exposed to more and more risk.\u201d Any type of immunity present in the population will provide a selection pressure for the virus to get around this immunity, if it can. In many cases however, and particularly for viruses like coronaviruses, evidence suggests that this escape is usually not complete, particularly over shorter time periods. This means that even if you get infected, you benefit from \u201cimperfect immunity\u201d by being protected against severe outcomes. We see this reflected in what we have learned from SARS-CoV-2 vaccination data. This means that even when viruses have selection pressure on them from population immunity, it is not correct to assume, as the article does, that just because we may see some level of immune escape, this means that booster vaccines will be needed forever, or beyond the most vulnerable, or very frequently. But most importantly, it\u2019s not only vaccine immunity which provides this selection pressure: immunity from infection does as well, despite the impression given by the article (\u201cThe more people you vaccinate, the greater the number of vaccine-resistant mutations you are likely to get\u201d).

        "title":"Shredded masks and broken glass: Green ingredients for better concrete",
        "link":"https:\/\/newatlas.com\/materials\/green-ingredients-better-concrete\/",
        "text":"From residential homes and skyscrapers to art sculptures and footpaths, concrete is everywhere you look and it's difficult to imagine the modern world without it. As the most widely-used human-made material on Earth, it also plays a huge role in global carbon emissions thanks to its energy intensive production. This means that even slight adjustments to how we make it can have big impacts on its environmental footprint. And as research continue to show, scientists working in this space are not short of ideas. Concrete has been used as a construction material for millennia and remains popular to this day, with good reason. It's cheap, it's strong, it's simple to make and it lasts a very long time. Global use of concrete today stands at around 30 billion tonnes annually, with demand only expected to increase from here. The massive carbon footprint of concrete stems largely from one key ingredient: cement. This is added to sand, gravel and water to form wet concrete that can be poured into molds to form structures as they dry, but the production of cement is far and away the most carbon-intensive part of the process. It involves using fossil fuels to heat limestone and clay to extreme temperatures, around 1,400 \u00b0C (2,552 \u00b0F). This not only requires huge amounts of energy, but the limestone needs to be extracted from the Earth and crushed up before being baked. This cooking process itself also releases vast amounts of stored carbon dioxide, around 600 kg (1,322 lb) worth for every ton of cement produced. All told, cement production accounts for around 8% of global carbon emissions. Substitutes for limestone? Limestone is a key ingredient in cement, and is therefore a key focus for scientists exploring more environmentally friendly alternatives. Last year, scientists at Stanford University cooked up a low-carbon cement recipe that swapped limestone for volcanic rock. This material needs to be treated in the same energy-intensive way to form cement, but doesn't contain any stored carbon that would be released throughout. Also last year, another interesting approach came from scientists in Germany and Brazil, whose low-carbon cement recipe used an abundant mining waste material called Belterra clay, which could replace 50 to 60 percent of the limestone. This leaves more carbon locked away in the ground, and it can also be baked at lower temperatures. This material was found to meet the performance criteria for traditional cement, but with a recipe that cuts carbon emissions by up to two thirds. One particularly interesting example of low-carbon cement came earlier this year from scientists at the University of Colorado Boulder, who were inspired by tiny microalgae that naturally sequester carbon dioxide and turn it into calcium carbonate shells they described as an \"armor of limestone.\" The scientists were able to rear these microalgae and have them produce this biologically grown limestone, and then integrate that into cement production in place of mined material. Material scientist Wil Srubar with a sample of concrete made using biogenic limestone Glenn Asakawa\/CU Boulder What made this bit of research so compelling, was that the resulting concrete not only looked and behaved like regular concrete, but could actually be carbon neutral or even carbon negative. This is because the microalgae capture more carbon dioxide to fuel the production of calcium carbonate than is generated through the process. These scientists were awarded a US$3.2-million grant to work on scaling up production of their biogenic limestone and carbon-neutral concrete. They estimate that 1-2 million acres of open ponds would provide enough space to cultivate the microalgae needed to meet the cement demands of the US. Concrete that lasts While the resilience of concrete is one of its attractive characteristics, that doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement. When cracks form in concrete structures, for example, it invites water inside that can greatly compromise its strength. This can make them expensive to maintain or can even call for a complete replacement to prevent a catastrophic collapse. This indirectly increases the material's carbon footprint, but there are some interesting solutions in the mix. These include forms of concrete that deploy a special glue to knit together its own cracks, and others that fill them in with fungus. One version of this self-healing concrete came from scientists at Worcester Polytechnic Institute last year, which used an enzyme found in human blood that could be worked into concrete powder before it is formed. When a small crack forms in the concrete, this enzyme reacts with CO2 in the air to produce calcium carbonate crystals, which then go on to fill in the gaps. In testing, the concrete proved capable of repairing its own cracks within 24 hours, with the scientists predicting that the technology could extend the lifespan of concrete structures by 20 to 80 years. One of the other ways scientists are looking to shore up the durability of concrete is, perhaps unsurprisingly, with the world's strongest artificial material. Incorporating graphene into concrete has been shown to make it stronger and more water resistant, and last year we got a first look at what shape it might take in the world. University of Manchester researchers Craig Dawson, Happiness Ijije and Lisa Scullion onsite as workers tend to the world's first graphene-enhanced concrete slab in the background University of Manchester\/Nationwide Engineering The University of Manchester's \"Concretene\" features tiny amounts of graphene added to the water and cement to act as mechanical support and boost the chemical reactions that turn the mix into concrete. The result is a concrete with stronger bonds, and around 30% higher strength. The material was poured into the world's first graphene-enhanced concrete slab in England last year, where engineers will monitor its performance. The thinking is, that because Concretene is far stronger than traditional concrete, less of it needs to be used to bring the same structural strength to a building. The team working on it calculate that if it was deployed across the global supply chain, it could shave around 2% off worldwide emissions. Addressing waste Indeed, making concrete stronger and better performing may help coax manufacturers toward its greener forms, and that mightn't just relate to its immediate carbon footprint. We've seen scientists get quite creative with incorporating waste materials into concrete to help not just recycling, but also boost its capabilities. In 2019, scientists at Australia's Deakin University took non-recyclable glass and ground it up into a coarse powder, which could be used in place of sand as an aggregate for polymer concrete, which proved significantly stronger. Discarded rubber tires are another waste material attracting significant interest in these circles, which can be ground up and used in place of sand or gravel as an aggregate. Last month, researchers at RMIT University took an impressive step forward, showing off a form of concrete that featured 100% tire-rubber aggregate and showed significant improvements in compressive, flexural and tensile strength. Back in 2017, MIT scientists developed a form of concrete that made use of irradiated plastic water bottles. Their approach involved exposing discarded plastic bottles to gamma radiation, before grinding them down and mixing them into cement along with fly ash. The resulting concrete proved 15 percent stronger than conventional concrete. We're also seeing scientists seeking to address the mounting waste generated by the coronavirus pandemic. RMIT University researchers last month demonstrated yet another form of eco-friendly concrete that incorporated personal protective equipment (PPE), 54 tonnes of which they say is produced every day. RMIT scientists have developed concrete that features shredded PPE gear for a boost in strength RMIT Gowns, face masks and rubber gloves were shredded and incorporated into concrete at different concentrations. The rubber gloves were found to boost compressive strength by up to 22%, while the face masks improved it by up to 17%. The shredded gowns improved compressive strength by 15%, elasticity by 12% and resistance to bending stress by up to 21%. Towards greener construction Given that these types of research projects and experimental concretes are still in their early developmental phases, there is a long way to go before we see them put any sort of dent in global carbon emissions. But they do illustrate the many possibilities when it comes to how we might lessen the environmental impact of this omnipresent material. Even small reductions in its carbon footprint could mark some big steps forward.",

        "text":"Recently, the CDC released data on COVID comorbidities, including data showing that 6% of COVID-19 deaths only listed COVID on the death certificate, while the remaining 94% of COVID deaths also listed other conditions. Many have jumped on this as proof that COVID is far less deadly than previously claimed, and they are arguing that most reported COVID deaths are actually just people who died of some other condition while happening to have COVID. In particular, I keep seeing an analogy of someone who has COVID getting hit by a car, then the death being attributed to COVID. This is a very bad analogy (and faulty argument in general) that horribly mischaracterizes these data. So, I want to briefly explain what is actually going on. First, you need to realize that when a patient dies, doctors list all of the factors that contributed to the death. This often includes multiple conditions, at which point we call them \u201ccomorbidities.\u201d In the case of COVID, two main things are happening. First, in some cases, people have a pre-existing condition that interacts with COVID and makes them more likely to die from COVID. Second, COVID leads to conditions that then contribute to the death. Let\u2019s start with the pre-existing condition situation. We know that people with some health conditions are more prone to die from COVID than people without those conditions, because those conditions make them more vulnerable to COVID. Thus, there is an interaction between COVID and the pre-existing condition, with both contributing to the death. Importantly, however, in most cases, the person would not have died at this particular point in time had it not been for COVID. In other words, something like an existing respiratory problem makes people more sensitive to COVID, resulting in a higher death rate when infected with COVID. That does not mean that COVID wasn\u2019t a key factor in their deaths. It is simply that it was not the only factor. By way of analogy, imagine that someone with asthma gets trapped in an environment with lots of smog, ultimately resulting in an inability to breathe and subsequent death. What killed them? Well, both the asthma and the smog played a role. The smog was a serious problem because of the asthma, but conversely, they could have kept on living with the asthma had it not been for the smog. If we could have prevented them form being exposed to the smog, they would have lived. Even so, for many people, COVID is fatal because of interactions with other conditions, but that still means that COVID was fatal. It still means that they would have lived had it not been for COVID. To give one final analogy, imagine a disease that is far deadlier in men than in women. Imagine that we look at the mortality statistics form that disease and see that 94% of deaths were from men. It would clearly be absurd to say, \u201cthey didn\u2019t die form the disease, it was being a male that killed them.\u201d That would obviously be nuts. It would be apparent to everyone that there was an interaction between the disease and sex that causes men to be more sensitive to it. Even so, there are interactions between many pre-existing conditions and COVID that make people with those conditions more sensitive to COVID and more likely to die from it. On the flip side, many of the reported comorbidities are actually caused by COVID. Look at the data from the CDC. The single most common comorbidity category* (68,004) was influenza\/pneumonia. These diseases are often secondary infections that happen as a result of viral infections. Similarly, respiratory failure was present in 54,803 cases. Again, this is something that we know COVID causes. So many of these comorbidities are actually caused by COVID! *Technically, the most common category was \u201cother\u201d which includes a very wide range of conditions that were grouped together because each was too uncommon to merit its own category. Thus the influenza\/pneumonia category was the most common category for discrete diseases, rather than the large hodgepodge of conditions. By way of analogy, the argument being made by science deniers is no different from someone bleeding out from a gunshot wound, then someone else saying, \u201cbullets aren\u2019t dangerous, because she died from blood loss, not the bullet.\u201d That\u2019s obviously a dumb argument. She only lost the blood because of the bullet. Even so, many people are only dying from conditions like respiratory failure or heart failure because of COVID19. It is also worth noting that, as is often the case, this argument is straight out of the anti-vaccine playbook. For diseases like measles, secondary infections with diseases like pneumonia often contribute to children\u2019s deaths. Thus, anti-vaccers incorrectly argue that measles isn\u2019t deadly because the pneumonia is what killed them. Just like COVID and my gunshot example, however, they only developed pneumonia because of measles. So now, with all of that in place, let\u2019s circle back the analogy of someone getting hit by a car. I like analogies a lot. I have frequently argued that they are valuable for testing whether consistent reasoning is being applied. However, as I have explained before, for the analogies to be useful, they must follow the same logical structure as the original argument. That is very clearly not the case here. Someone who happens to have COVID getting hit by a car is a very, very different thing from either someone with a pre-existing condition that predisposes them to complications from COVID dying from an interaction between the condition and COVID or COVID itself causing a secondary condition. Do you see the difference? The vast majority of comorbidities listed are directly related to COVID either as a factor that exacerbates the situation or as a result of COVID. In contrast, the car accident has nothing to do with COVID. They are not analogous, and anyone who would use such a clearly terrible argument obviously does not know what they are talking about. Having said all of that, there are almost certainly some cases in this database where COVID truly wasn\u2019t the cause. There are probably some cases where someone who had COVID just happened to have a heat attack that would have happened without the COVID, or where someone who had COVID was in an accident, but when you start looking closely at the data, those are clearly a very tiny minority, and the vast majority of comorbidities relate to COVID. Indeed, beyond these data and all the data looking at how COVID attacks the body, we also know that there have been far more deaths this year in the US than there were during the same time period last year (Weinberger et al. 2020). Indeed, there are more excess deaths than the total number of reported COVID deaths. Understanding exactly what that means is very complicated because there are many contributing factors. We may be underestimating COVID deaths, but also, there may be increased deaths due to factors like people not seeking medical help for conditions for which they normally would seek help. Conversely, things like a decrease in car accidents could pull the number the other direction. However, several pieces of evidence (such as a spike in excess deaths in places that had large outbreaks with many reported COVID deaths; e.g., New York city) indicate the COVID is a key factor in the number of excess deaths seen this year, and it is very unlikely that we are grossly overestimating the COVID mortalities. As others have pointed out, the correct way to look at this 6% figure is not that only 6% of reported COVID deaths were actually from COVID. Rather, it means that of all the people who died from COVID, 6% did not have any other reported conditions. In other words, these data show that some people are more vulnerable to COVID than others due to existing health conditions (which we already knew) and COVID often results in secondary problems which contribute to patients\u2019 demise (again, which we already knew). Stop trying to twist science to fit your personal agenda and look rationally at the facts. Think critically and don\u2019t blindly believe something just because you saw it on Facebook or Twitter.

To give one final analogy, imagine a disease that is far deadlier in men than in women. Imagine that we look at the mortality statistics form that disease and see that 94% of deaths were from men. It would clearly be absurd to say, \u201cthey didn\u2019t die form the disease, it was being a male that killed them.\u201d That would obviously be nuts. It would be apparent to everyone that there was an interaction between the disease and sex that causes men to be more sensitive to it. Even so, there are interactions between many pre-existing conditions and COVID that make people with those conditions more sensitive to COVID and more likely to die from it. On the flip side, many of the reported comorbidities are actually caused by COVID. Look at the data from the CDC. The single most common comorbidity category* (68,004) was influenza\/pneumonia. These diseases are often secondary infections that happen as a result of viral infections. Similarly, respiratory failure was present in 54,803 cases. Again, this is something that we know COVID causes. So many of these comorbidities are actually caused by COVID! *Technically, the most common category was \u201cother\u201d which includes a very wide range of conditions that were grouped together because each was too uncommon to merit its own category. Thus the influenza\/pneumonia category was the most common category for discrete diseases, rather than the large hodgepodge of conditions. By way of analogy, the argument being made by science deniers is no different from someone bleeding out from a gunshot wound, then someone else saying, \u201cbullets aren\u2019t dangerous, because she died from blood loss, not the bullet.\u201d That\u2019s obviously a dumb argument. She only lost the blood because of the bullet. Even so, many people are only dying from conditions like respiratory failure or heart failure because of COVID19. It is also worth noting that, as is often the case, this argument is straight out of the anti-vaccine playbook. For diseases like measles, secondary infections with diseases like pneumonia often contribute to children\u2019s deaths. Thus, anti-vaccers incorrectly argue that measles isn\u2019t deadly because the pneumonia is what killed them. Just like COVID and my gunshot example, however, they only developed pneumonia because of measles. So now, with all of that in place, let\u2019s circle back the analogy of someone getting hit by a car. I like analogies a lot. I have frequently argued that they are valuable for testing whether consistent reasoning is being applied. However, as I have explained before, for the analogies to be useful, they must follow the same logical structure as the original argument. That is very clearly not the case here. Someone who happens to have COVID getting hit by a car is a very, very different thing from either someone with a pre-existing condition that predisposes them to complications from COVID dying from an interaction between the condition and COVID or COVID itself causing a secondary condition. Do you see the difference? The vast majority of comorbidities listed are directly related to COVID either as a factor that exacerbates the situation or as a result of COVID. In contrast, the car accident has nothing to do with COVID. They are not analogous, and anyone who would use such a clearly terrible argument obviously does not know what they are talking about. Having said all of that, there are almost certainly some cases in this database where COVID truly wasn\u2019t the cause. There are probably some cases where someone who had COVID just happened to have a heat attack that would have happened without the COVID, or where someone who had COVID was in an accident, but when you start looking closely at the data, those are clearly a very tiny minority, and the vast majority of comorbidities relate to COVID. Indeed, beyond these data and all the data looking at how COVID attacks the body, we also know that there have been far more deaths this year in the US than there were during the same time period last year (Weinberger et al. 2020). Indeed, there are more excess deaths than the total number of reported COVID deaths. Understanding exactly what that means is very complicated because there are many contributing factors. We may be underestimating COVID deaths, but also, there may be increased deaths due to factors like people not seeking medical help for conditions for which they normally would seek help. Conversely, things like a decrease in car accidents could pull the number the other direction. However, several pieces of evidence (such as a spike in excess deaths in places that had large outbreaks with many reported COVID deaths; e.g., New York city) indicate the COVID is a key factor in the number of excess deaths seen this year, and it is very unlikely that we are grossly overestimating the COVID mortalities. As others have pointed out, the correct way to look at this 6% figure is not that only 6% of reported COVID deaths were actually from COVID. Rather, it means that of all the people who died from COVID, 6% did not have any other reported conditions. In other words, these data show that some people are more vulnerable to COVID than others due to existing health conditions (which we already knew) and COVID often results in secondary problems which contribute to patients\u2019 demise (again, which we already knew). Stop trying to twist science to fit your personal agenda and look rationally at the facts. Think critically and don\u2019t blindly believe something just because you saw it on Facebook or Twitter.

        "text":"Concern over unknown, future side effects is by far the most common reason I hear people give for why they aren\u2019t vaccinating against COVID. At a quick glance, that may seem reasonable, but when you start really looking into the science, it quickly becomes clear that there is simply no reason to suspect that there will be dangerous long-term consequences of these vaccines. Indeed, based on everything we know about the immune system, vaccines in general, and these vaccines specifically, it is extremely unlikely that they will cause unknown, serious, wide-spread side effects in the future, and the known risks from COVID far outweigh the hypothetical risks from the vaccines. In this post, I\u2019m going to carefully go over the science and logic that allows us to be so confident in the long-term safety of these vaccines, but before I do that, I want to briefly explain who my target audience is here, namely, the \u201cvaccine hesitant.\u201d I am refereeing to the people who usually would not consider themselves \u201canti-vaccers\u201d and would usually vaccinate themselves and their children but have been swept up in the maelstrom of misinformation and fear about the new COVID vaccines. If you are someone who is truly seeking information and trying to think for yourself, then please hear me out and seriously consider the arguments and evidence that I am going to present. Do not give in to the baseless fearmongering that is rampaging through the internet and media. To that end, I want to point out right at the start that this tactic of stirring up fear of future, unknown, long-term consequences is not new or unique to COVID vaccines. It is straight out of the traditional anti-vaccine playbook. It is something I was writing about long before COVID, and the argument is just as flawed now as it was then. So, if you are someone who eschews the title \u201canti-vaccer,\u201d but are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of the arguments about unknown, long-term effects, please realize that these are not new arguments that arose out of legitimate concerns specifically about COVID vaccines. Rather, stoking fear of future unknowns is a standard (and flawed) anti-vaccer tactic that they have been using for decades and are now dressing up and presenting as if it is a novel concern for COVID vaccines. Do not be fooled by this tactic. This post is necessarily long, because there\u2019s a lot to talk about in order to cover this topic properly, but, again, I have written this for people who are truly trying to think for themselves, and are truly seeking information. So if that is you, please read this carefully in its entirety. Because of the length of this post, I will summarize key points in bullets below, before elaborating on each of them. Summary: TL;DR mRNA vaccines have been being studied for over a decade (including human trials). Current COVID vaccines have been extremely well studied, with sample sizes of hundreds of thousands of people, and studies have been compiled into large meta-analyses\/systematic reviews. Thus, the short-term risks of the vaccines are extremely well-documented, and the benefits outweigh the risks. The only \u201cunknown\u201d is about long-term effects; however\u2026 No vaccine has ever caused the type of widespread, serious side effect years down the road that everyone is afraid of. Nearly all side effects occur shortly after vaccination (see #2). The only example of a sided effect that showed up months later appear within a year (whereas we\u2019ve been using COVID vaccines for over a year) and was rare. The vaccine benefits still outweighed the risks. Vaccines rarely cause long-term (future) side effects because they use low doses over a short time. Vaccines simply train your immune system. Vaccines are quickly removed from the body. Most vaccine components were well-studied, and their safety is known. mRNA: mRNA does not alter your DNA. mRNA is very quickly broken down and removed. mRNA in vaccines cannot make your body produce entire viruses. You are constantly exposed to mRNA from viruses (e.g., from colds) If you catch COVID, your cells will use viral mRNA to make proteins just like they do from the vaccine, but\u2026 Your cells will make entire viruses, not just a single protein. You will be exposed to far higher levels of mRNA. Side effects from immune stimulation will usually happen right away and will usually be worse from actual infection with COVID. A demand for long-term studies is meaningless unless you can justify why a particular length of time is needed. No matter how long something has been studied, it is always technically possible that an effect won\u2019t show up until slightly after the length of that study. This is true for all medications, foods, minerals, vitamins, etc., yet we don\u2019t fear most of them. Therefore, you must provide actual evidence or reasoning to think that a futre side-effect is actually likely. Focusing on a highly-unlikely, unknown, hypothetical risk from the vaccine while downplaying the very real and serious risk from COVID is bad risk assessment. Fears over unknown long-term effects of the vaccines are baseless. The burden of proof is on anyone claiming that the vaccines are dangerous. Not as new as you might think Before we go into the details of the COVID vaccines, we need some background information to put them in context, and I think it is important to point out that these vaccine technologies are not as new as people are often led to believe. Sure, these exact vaccines were developed recently, but mRNA vaccines have been being developed and tested for years. Thus, the underlying technology is well-studied. Let me direct you to a review paper published in 2018 (before COVID) titled, \u201cmRNA vaccines \u2014 a new era in vaccinology\u201d (Pardi et al. 2018). This review covers over a decade of research on mRNA vaccines, including safety and efficiency trials on mice (Fleeton 2001; Geall et al. 2012; Magini et al. 2016), ferrets (Brazzoli et al. 2015), pigs (Schnee et al. 2016), monkeys (Brito et al. 2014), and yes, even humans (Craenenbroeck et al. 2015; Bahl 2017; Alberer et al. 2017). As you\u2019d expect in a rapidly growing field, even more studies were published following that review, (but prior to COVID). Feldman et al. (2019), for example tested mRNA influenza vaccines in over 200 people, including following them for a full year after the vaccines to assess safety and effectiveness. Similarly, studies like Alberer et al. (2017) followed patients for a year prior to publishing and continued to follow them after publication. To be clear, those human trials were small trials; my point is simply that we were able to develop these COVID vaccines so quickly not by rushing, but rather by utilizing a robust body of research that had already been conducted. All of the information was there, waiting to be applied to something like COVID. The way that people (including politicians and the media) are talking about these vaccines, you\u2019d think that they represent totally uncharted territory. Reading the comments on my page, people are acting like we have almost no knowledge about them and are shooting in the dark, recklessly plowing into the unknown, but that\u2019s simply not true. In reality, we knew a ton about mRNA vaccines before COVID, and that should really change your perspective on these vaccines. It is so easy to give into fear of the unknown, particularly when you are so constantly bombarded with people\u2019s concerns. I don\u2019t blame anyone for that;\u2019 it\u2019s human nature, but it\u2019s important that we use logic and facts to overcome our base fears, and if you step back and start to rationally look at the wealth of knowledge these vaccines were based on (including human trials spanning a year or more), that really should paint these vaccines in a different light and help to alleviate those fears. Note that I only cited a small handful of the studies that had been conducted prior to COVID. What we know: proximate (short-term) side effects The crux of the concern over these vaccines is fear of the unknown, so before we can talk about the unknown, we need to be clear on what we do know, as well as clearly defining what we mean by \u201cunknown, long-term effects.\u201d There are basically two categories of effects we need to talk about: Proximate effects (short-term) = effects that first occur shortly after vaccination Unknown future effects (long-term) = effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination (Note 1) It is important to make this distinction, because I often find that people meander back and forth between these two without having a clear understanding of what is actually known or how it is known. So let me try to be as clear as possible: we have an extremely robust understanding of proximate effects, and the fact that the vaccines are new is 100% irrelevant. Proximate effects are fairly straightforward to test. First, scientists conduct phase 1\u20133 human trials using a randomized, placebo-controlled approach, where they follow thousands of patients for several weeks following vaccination. Then, once the vaccine is released to the general public, scientists continue to monitor it for side effects using things like large cohort studies and case-controlled studies. As the sample sizes increase, so does our ability to detect increasingly rare events. With tens of thousands of participants, we can detect events that occur every few thousand people, but we will miss events that happen once for every 10,000 people. At a few hundred thousand people, we can detect events that occur once per tens of thousands of people, but will miss events that happen once for every 100,000 people, etc. (Note: numbers are approximations). There are two critical points here. First, because our ability to detect rare side effects is dependent on sample size, as the sample size increases, any new side effects will, by definition, be increasingly rare. By the time we are into the millions (as we are with COVID vaccines) we aren\u2019t going to suddenly find a new common serious side effect, because those would have been picked up at much smaller sample sizes. Second, the novelty of the vaccines is completely and totally irrelevant. Because we are talking about events that happen within a few weeks of being vaccinated, it does not matter if the vaccines have been available for two months or two hundred years. The only thing that matters is the sample size (i.e., number of participants). Let me say that again (in bold), our ability to confidently know the rates of proximate side effects depends entirely on the sample size; the age of the vaccine is 100% irrelevant. In the case of COVID, we were able to get these sample sizes extremely quickly because there were so many cases of COVID and governments dumped so much money into massive vaccine campaigns. All of the currently recommended vaccines passed their initial phase 3 trials with large sample sizes. For example, Pfizer used over 43,000 participants (Polack et al. 2020), and Moderna used over 30,000 (Mahase 2020). Following those phase 3 trials, numerous large studies have been released. Indeed, so many studies have been conducted that we can do systematic reviews and meta-analyses. As explained here, these combine the data from multiple studies to look for overarching effects and are the highest level of scientific evidence. Qianhui et al. (2021), for example, included 87 different safety studies, and concluded that, \u201cAvailable evidence indicates that eligible COVID-19 vaccines have an acceptable short-term safety profile.\u201d Yet more studies have been conducted since that review\/meta-analysis, and some of them are truly massive. Barda et al. (2021), for example, compared over 800,000 vaccinated individuals to over 800,000 unvaccinated individuals to look at the rates of adverse events from the Pfizer vaccine as well as the rates of those same events in people who develop COVID. Not only did the vaccine have low rates of serious side effects, but, for most conditions (including myocarditis and myocardial infarction), the rates of those events were higher in people who caught COVID than in people who received vaccines (Note 2). Other calculations of the rates of specific adverse events have had even large sample sizes. For example, the Israel Ministry of Health used over 5 million people to calculate the rate of myocarditis following vaccination. Similarly, in the USA, the CDC has several hundred million vaccine doses to use in its calculations. The point is that we are extremely confident about the short-term consequences of the vaccines. It\u2019s hard to overstate the massive volume of data we have. Barda et al. (2021), for example, is one of largest cohort studies I have ever read. It is larger than most studies on the safety of well-established vaccines that have been available for decades. Indeed, we have been able to quickly collect so much data that our knowledge of the short-term safety of COVID vaccines is equal to or greater than our knowledge of the short-term safety of many standard vaccines. Again, to be 100% clear, the fact that the vaccines are relatively new simply does not matter for these short-term effects. Further, these studies aren\u2019t the result of \u201crushing.\u201d Rather, it is simply matter of vaccinating so many people so quickly that we were able to rapidly collect the data that would usually take years to accumulate. It is the size and volume of the studies that matters, and we have numerous truly massive studies unequivocally showing that serious side effects are rare and the benefits outweigh the risks. To put it simply, the short-term side effects of the COVID vaccines have been thoroughly studied and are extremely well-documented. Scientifically, these vaccines are no longer experimental (with the exception of their application to young children, in some cases). They have already passed numerous experiments and the evidence is clear (Pfizer isn\u2019t \u201cexperimental\u201d legally either). Insisting that we haven\u2019t studied the vaccines well-enough to know the short-term side effects is, at this stage, science denial. See Note 3 regarding the supposed vaccine-related deaths and injuries reported in VAERS. Vaccines don\u2019t cause wide-spread, long-term adverse events Now we can finally turn our attention specifically to the topic of unknown, long-term effects (which, remember, are effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination; Note 1). I realize I took a long time getting here, but that background was important, because I have shown that we have a massive body of studies showing that the COVID vaccines have few serious side effects shortly after receiving them. Thus, the only way to doubt their safety without outright science denial is to raise concerns over presently unknown, long-term effects, but, as I will show, those concerns have no scientific merit. The type of future long-term consequence that everyone seems so afraid of (i.e., the type that only manifests months or years down the road) is virtually unheard of from vaccines. I looked long and hard for examples of this occurring, and in the entire history of vaccines, I was only able to find one: Pandemrix, an H1N1 vaccine used in Europe for the 2009\u20132010 flu season was associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy that usually only manifested weeks or months after the vaccine. You can read more details on Thoughtscapism and Skeptical Raptor, but there are just three points I want to make. Depending on the study, the lag between vaccination and onset of narcolepsy was 0-242 days (median = 42; Partinen et al. 2012) or 0-360 days (median not reported; Nohynek et al. 2012). Pfizer and Moderna both began their phase 3 COVID vaccine trials on 27 July 2020 (~400 days ago) and received emergency use authorization (thus starting mass vaccination campaigns in the USA) in December 2020 (~260 days ago). Indeed, Israel had already administered over 1 million doses by the end of 2020. This means we are already past the time frame where we should have started picking up something comparable to the long-term effects of Pandemrix. As is so often the case with vaccine side effects, the disease they prevent (influenza in this case) also causes the same side effect. This side effects was rare (between 1 in 52,000 doses and 1 in 57,500 doses in England [Miller et al. 2013] and 1 in 16,000 in Finland [Nohynek et al. 2012; for unclear reasons, Finland had a high rate that could not be generalized to other countries), and the benefits of the vaccine still outweighed the risk. That last point is really important, because for it to turn out that avoiding the COVID vaccines was the safer choice, unknown future side effects would not only have to exist, but they would have to be so common and so serious that they outweigh the enormous known benefits of the vaccines, and that is a situation that has never occurred for any vaccine (Note 4). For reasons that I\u2019ll explain in the next sections, that\u2019s simply not how vaccines interact with the body. So, if you are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of a fear of unknown, serious, long-term side effects, ask yourself, is that fear really rational given that future, long-term side effects of vaccines are virtually unheard of, and there has never been a case where those side effects were widespread and outweighed the benefits of the vaccines? Why vaccines don\u2019t cause future long-term effects: Low dose, short exposure Let\u2019s now talk about why vaccine side effects nearly always show up shortly after vaccination. The type of long-term consequence we are talking about typically comes from one of two causes: a very large dose over a short time, or a small dose over a prolonged period of time. Vaccines don\u2019t fit either of those categories. They are fundamentally different from most medications because they simply train your immune system before being quickly removed. Your own immune system is what provides a lasting benefit. Further, vaccines do this via low, non-toxic doses. Remember, the dose makes the poison. Everything, even water (Garigan and Ristedt 1999), is toxic at a high enough dose and safe at a low enough dose. So people who scream about \u201cTOXIC CHEMICALS\u201d in vaccines are ignoring basic chemistry. There is no such thing as a toxic chemical, there are only toxic doses, and the doses in vaccines are not toxic. One of the most common arguments I hear people making to justify concerns over COVID vaccines is, \u201clook at all the examples of drugs that were approved, then years later long-term effects were found.\u201d Those examples are, however, nearly always for drugs that were taken repeatedly. It\u2019s the cumulative effect that causes the risk (particularly for chemicals that persist in your body for long periods of time). Vaccines, in contrast, have limited exposure, and your body quickly eliminates them. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, the vaccine itself has been totally eliminated from your body. The long-term protection comes from immune system memory, not from the vaccines themselves. This is really important, because it means we don\u2019t have a mechanism through which COVID vaccines would cause long-term harm. Because vaccines are a low doses given 2-3 times, we expect any consequences to happen quickly, which is exactly what we find. The most common side effects are things like soreness and moderate flu symptoms that start within a few hours or days of receiving the vaccine. These effects aren\u2019t because the vaccine is \u201ctoxic\u201d but rather because it is doing exactly what it was designed to do and stimulating your immune system. It\u2019s that activation of your immune system that makes you feel unwell, but that activation is critical, because it is how your immune system learns to identify and fight COVID. Similarly, serious side effects from the vaccines, while rare, usually show up shortly after vaccination. Side effects that don\u2019t show up for months or years simply aren\u2019t expected from vaccines because of how vaccines work. Nevertheless, in the following sections, let\u2019s look more closely at the three main hypothetical sources of long-term harm: adjuvants\/preservatives, mRNA, and immune activation. #1: Adjuvants and preservatives Vaccines typical consist of three basic components: a representation of the infectious agent (antigens, weakened viruses, virus particles, mRNA, etc.), an adjuvant that simulates the immune system and\/or aids in delivery of the antigen, mRNA, etc., and preservatives (usually salts, metals, and sugars) to avoid contamination and stabilize the other components. The later two categories (adjuvants and preservatives) are historically the things that anti-vaccers have targeted (e.g., the infamous, and completely false, accusation that thimerosal [ethyl-mercury] caused autism). These accusations have, however, never stood up to scrutiny. Vaccine components have been well-studied and are safe at the doses used in vaccines. Specifically for COVID vaccines, their components differ from one vaccine to the next, but the safety of the components is well-known. Many of them use standard salts\/metals that have been used in numerous previous vaccines and medications, and the non-mRNA vaccines usually use the adjuvants that have already been used in other vaccines. Specifically for the mRNA vaccines, they use a different type of antigen known as a \u201clipid nanoparticle\u201d (basically a small, fancy fat) that stimulates the immune system and serves as a delivery mechanism for the mRNA. These are new for a commercially available vaccines (because we\u2019ve never had commercially available mRNA vaccines before), but that doesn\u2019t make the nanoparticles themselves new, and there is a wealth of studies on them (including studies on other vaccines that have been being developed [see previous section on the history of mRNA vaccines]). See Hou et al. (2021) for an extensive review of the topic. My point is simply that while the vaccines are \u201cnew,\u201d their components have been well-studied, and there is simply no reason to think that they pose a long-term danger. #2: mRNA Now let\u2019s turn our attention to the big one that has so many people worried: mRNA. At the outset, we need to be clear on what mRNA is and which it does. Your cells contain DNA stored in the nucleus. This provides the plans for your body and how it runs, and it is what you pass on to make your offspring when you procreate. For the actual day-to-day running of your body, however, it has to be transcribed into mRNA (aka \u201cmessenger RNA\u201d). This is a single stranded copy of your double-stranded DNA. The mRNA can then leave the nucleus and go to the ribosomes (little protein factories in your cells) which translate the mRNA into amino acids which are then strung together and folded to form proteins. This is happing millions of times in your body each second. Importantly, the process does not alter your DNA. Your genetic code is unaffected. Think of it like taking a master copy of a recipe, photocopying it, then giving that photocopy to someone who then follows the instructions on it. Viruses are actually pretty neat and replicate by tapping into this system. They can\u2019t reproduce on their own. Instead, they insert their DNA or RNA into your cells and hijack your molecular machinery by making the ribosomes translate their RNA and build new virus (some viruses have DNA and require a transcription step, others [like COVID] store their genetic material as RNA). The mRNA vaccines tap into this same process. They include a small fragment of the RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus (specifically for the spike protein), thus causing your cells to produce that spike protein. Your immune system is then stimulated to attack the spike protein, and in the process, it learns to attack the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus. Take a minute to stop and marvel at the ingenuity of this system, because it\u2019s incredible. There are several important points that need to be made here: This process does not alter your DNA. The viral mRNA does not get integrated into your DNA. This is not gene therapy. All that happens is protein production by ribosomes. Again, this is like handing your cells a photocopy of a set of instructions. mRNA is a very fragile, short-lived molecule. During my PhD, I worked in a laboratory where some people do RNA research, and they often joked that if you looked at the vials the wrong way the RNA would vanish. The point is that the mRNA from the vaccines very quickly breaks down and is removed from your body. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, it is totally gone. The vaccines only contain the mRNA for a single protein. It is impossible for them to cause your body to make the full virus. They simply don\u2019t contain that information. This is a process that is already happening constantly in your body. Right now, you almost certainly have some viruses (even if you are healthy), and those viruses are hijacking your cells with their RNA and forcing your cells to make virus for them. Indeed, unlike with the vaccine, they are making your body produce entire viruses, not just a single protein. Similarly, anytime you become infected with a cold, the flu, etc., your body is exposed to tons of viral RNA which it then translates into proteins (entire viruses) (related to #4) If you become infected with COVID, this process is going to happen anyway, but unlike with the vaccine, your cells are going to produce the entire virus, and, because the virus will be replicating, you will be exposed to substantially more viral RNA for a longer period of time. That last point is incredibly important, because it means that any fears you have about the mRNA in the vaccine should be even greater for the virus itself. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to simultaneously downplay the seriousness of COVID while fearing the mRNA in the vaccines, because if you catch COVID, you are going to be exposed to substantially higher doses of viral RNA! As you can hopefully see, none of this lends credence to the idea that the vaccine will cause long-term effects. There is simply no mechanism through which the mRNA could cause long-term harm, and even if there was a concern over long-term effects, that concern would be even higher from actually catching COVID! #3. Immune activation The final way in which vaccines could, in concept, cause harm is as a side effect of the inflammatory immune response they stimulate. Indeed, that is the cause of most vaccine side effects. The vaccine sets off a cascade of immune responses, and sometimes your body gets caught in the crossfire, though this rarely causes serious problems. Importantly, however, this happens while your immune system is being stimulated. This isn\u2019t a pathway that we would expect to not cause any noticeable problems shortly after vaccination, then suddenly cause massive problems down the road. It could, in concept, cause a problem that starts shortly after vaccination and persists long-term, but it\u2019s unlikely to cause problems that don\u2019t appear until months or years later. This is important because, again, problems that arise shortly after vaccination and persist aren\u2019t what we are talking about. Those aren\u2019t unknown. Rather, we already know that those are rare because we can detect them shortly after vaccination (see previous section on short-term studies). Finally, as I\u2019ve alluded to several times already, problems that arise as a result of immune activation should also arise as the result of actual infection with SARS-CoV-2, and they\u2019d usually be expected to be worse or more common from an actual infection. Indeed, that\u2019s exactly what Barda et al. (2021) found. So, once again, it makes no sense to fear this as a consequence of the vaccine while downplaying the seriousness of COVID, because infection with COVID is more likely to cause this problem (see Note 2 on absolute risk). How long is long enough? This is an issue that I\u2019ve written about several times before (e.g., here and here), but in short, the demand for long-term data becomes extremely problematic unless \u201clong-term\u201d is carefully defined and justified beforehand. We already have over a year of data on COVID vaccines, plus many years of data on mRNA vaccines more generally. For most scientists, based on everything we know, that is plenty long enough to be confident in the safety of these vaccines, but if you are going to claim that it is not long enough, the questions become \u201cwhy?\u201d and \u201chow long is long enough?\u201d As I said earlier, anti-vacces have used this argument against vaccines for ages, and the problem is that they constantly shift the goal posts. If you show them a 3-year study, they say, \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 5 years.\u201d If you show them a 5-year study, they say \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 10 years.\u201d If you show them a 10-year study, they switch to 15 years, 20 years, etc. They can keep extending it all the way until the end of the human life-span, and beyond the fact that continually shifting the goal posts is an ad hoc fallacy (and this whole thing is an argument from ignorance fallacy), demanding 15 years of data is only slightly more irrational than demanding 10 years, or even 5 years or 3 years. Really think about this. Given that no vaccine has ever had a wide-spread, serious side effect that only shows up more than a year after vaccination, what is the justification for demanding 3 years of data instead of accepting the year+ of data we have? How is the demand for 3 years of data more logical than a demand for 10 years, or 20 years, or 60 years? All of those are time categories where we\u2019ve never seen a vaccine suddenly cause new problems and for which we have zero reason to expect these vaccines to cause problems. The probability of a long-term effect only showing up over a year after vaccination is pretty close to zero, which means that it is close to zero for 3 years, 5 years, etc. Bad risk assessment As I\u2019ve shown throughout this post, there is simply no good evidence to suggest that the COVID vaccines will have serious long-term consequences that only show up in the future. It\u2019s a baseless fear. Meanwhile, we know that COVID itself is very serious. In the USA alone, it has killed over 650,000 people. In 2020, it was the third leading cause of death in the USA, and in early 2021, it briefly spiked to the #1 slot before dropping back to position #3. We should not be downplaying something that is so prevalent and deadly that it is the third leading cause of death. Further, beyond death, many people suffer serious complications from COVID, some of which will likely persist into the future (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). Therefore, based on everything we know (which is a lot), risk assessment clearly shows that you are safer with the vaccine than without it, and while it is technically possible that there will be future unknown consequences of the vaccine, these would be even more likely from COVID itself, and it is incredibly unlikely that they will happen from the vaccines and be serious and widespread enough to alter the risk assessment. By avoiding the vaccine, you are placing more weight on an unknown and unlikely hypothetical future risk than you are placing on a very real and serious known risk. See the following posts for more details including the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument, precautionary principle argument, and COVID comorbidities. Long-term fears are baseless: The burden of proof As I\u2019ve explained throughout, there is not one shred of evidence nor a single logical argument that makes it likely that the vaccines will have unknown long-term consequences. This is a completely made-up concern. This isn\u2019t a situation where we have preliminary data suggesting a concern, or a logical\/scientific basis for thinking that there is a risk. Rather, this is a concern that was pulled out of thin air with absolutely no evidence behind it. Further, to be clear, the fact that something is new does not make it likely that there are unknown long-term effects. Indeed, everything we know about vaccines and the immune system makes it extremely unlikely that there will be future, unknown, wide-spread, long-term consequences. Is it technically possible? Sure, but there are an infinite number of technically possible things that will probably never happen. \u201cTechnically possible\u201d is not a valid justification for a fear, particularly if that fear will prevent you from taking a medication that greatly lowers your risk of disease and death. For future unknown consequences to be a logically valid reason for not vaccinating, the probability of serious consequences occurring would need to be high enough to trump the massive known benefits of the vaccines. We would need some really compelling preliminary evidence to suggest that these future injuries will occur, and we simply don\u2019t have it, not one scrap of it. I say again, this is a made-up concern. Although it makes a certain amount of sense from the standpoint of the psychology of our panicky primate brains, it is a concern that is not based on any evidence or logic. You can\u2019t just make up a concern, then demand action based on that concern. You need actual evidence to support the concern. In medicine (and science more generally), it is not enough to simply say that something is technically possible. Rather, you have to show that there is a reasonable probability of it being true before it makes sense to treat it seriously (this is something known as the \u201cprior probability\u201d). Imagine, for example, that I decide that taking aspirin while drinking soda is dangerous, and when asked to justify that fear, I simply say, \u201cwell we don\u2019t know that it isn\u2019t dangerous. It\u2019s technically possible that it\u2019s dangerous, and look at how many drugs have been recalled because of some complication with another chemical.\u201d I think that we can all agree that my fear would be irrational, right? In technical terms, it would be an argument from ignorance fallacy. The fact that something is unknown, doesn\u2019t mean that I can act as if that thing is known to be dangerous. There are an infinite number of things that are unknown. There are an infinite number of potential interactions and long-term effects for all treatments, including vitamins, supplements, herbs, etc. There haven\u2019t been, for example, any 30-year studies on the effects of regularly taking most vitamins or supplements, and given that those are taken daily, they are far more likely to cause long-term issues. So why not be concerned about them? Do you see the point that I am getting at here? The fact that we haven\u2019t looked at 3-year effects of the vaccines (or 5 years, or 10 years, etc.) would only matter if we actually had evidence to suggest that there would be problems down the road, and we don\u2019t have that evidence. Indeed, all of the evidence suggests the opposite. Therefore, this is a baseless fear and the burden of proof is on those who are avoiding the vaccine based on these concerns. Now you could try to quibble with me and say that, \u201cNo one is saying that there definitely are long-term effects. We are just saying that we don\u2019t know if there are and, therefore, we should not take the vaccine until we do know.\u201d But, again, that doesn\u2019t work for all the reasons that I\u2019ve laid out. A lack of knowledge simply isn\u2019t sufficient in and of itself. This is an abuse of the precautionary principle, and although you may not be claiming that there are, in fact, long term effects, by choosing to avoid the vaccines, you are, nevertheless, acting as if there will be those effects. As explained earlier, that\u2019s bad risk assessment. I want to conclude this with some questions. If you are not vaccinating because of concerns over unknown long-term effects, ask yourself, \u201cwhy do I have those concerns?\u201d Can you point to any actual data to justify them, or is it simply a fear of the unknown? If the latter, ask yourself how likely it is that those fears will come true. The fact that something is new or unknown doesn\u2019t make it dangerous. Given the very real risk of COVID, the decade+ of research on mRNA vaccines, the decades of research on vaccines in general, the massive studies on the COVID vaccines, and the fact that no vaccine has ever had the type of serious, widespread, unknown, long-term side effect that everyone is so afraid of, does it really make rational sense to avoid the vaccines out of fear of the unknown? Does it really seem more likely that you will be injured by this totally hypothetical and unprecedented vaccine injury than by a virus that is currently the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA? Notes Note 1: When we talk about unknown long-term effects, we are not talking about adverse events that happen shortly after vaccination and continue to cause problems into the future (those are proximate events that have long-term consequences). We aren\u2019t talking about something like myocarditis which, in rare cases, occurs shortly after vaccination and (in a small subset of the most extreme cases) can cause long-term damage. We already know that those events are extremely rare, because we\u2019ve already been able to detect them. They aren\u2019t unknown. In other words, because those events are first detected shortly after vaccination, we have been able to test them with the current short-term studies and have shown that they are extremely rare. Note 2: Barda et al. (2021) was comparing rates among the vaccinated with rates among the infected, not absolute risk. Absolute risk depends on how likely you are to become infected. However, other analyses (e.g., Gargano et al. 2021) have shown that in high-risk countries like the USA, your absolute risk of serious injury and death is lower with the vaccine than without it, even if you are in a low-risk COVID group. Note 3: There are many false claims floating around about thousands of deaths following vaccination. These claims are based on VAERS which includes anything observed following vaccination and does not establish causation. With millions of people receiving vaccines, it is inevitable that a few thousand will die shortly afterwards just by chance. In the vast majority of cases, there is simply no reason to think that the vaccines were responsible. Similarly, while some of the adverse events reported in VAERS may have been caused by vaccines, most probably weren\u2019t. The database is self-reported (anyone can make entries), and some truly wacky submissions have been included. Further, again, the fact that something happened after vaccination absolutely does not mean that the vaccine caused it (that\u2019s a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy; more details here and here). To quote the CDC \u201cFDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it\u2019s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines\u201d (the bold was in the original). More details on VAERS here. Note 4: Again, to be 100% clear, we are talking about injuries that won\u2019t show up until later down the road. You certainly can find examples from decades ago where there were issues with a vaccine rollout (particularly concerning polio vaccines), but those issues were immediate, and that\u2019s not what we are talking about here. The COVID vaccines all underwent massive randomized controlled trials and have been carefully monitored following release to the public, and with the hundreds of millions of doses that we have administered, we have a very clear picture of the immediate risks and benefits. Those aren\u2019t unknowns. Related posts Literature cited Advertisement",

        "text":"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the argument that \u201c99% of COVID patients survive\u201d has been repeatedly used as an excuse to oppose public health measures including mask mandates, lockdowns, and, more recently, vaccines. It asserts that because COVID has a ~99% survivorship, is not really that big of a concern and vaccines, masks, lockdowns, etc. are not needed. There are many issues with this argument, but before I talk specifically about COVID-19, I want to discuss a hypothetical disease. Imagine that the majority of people who become infected with this hypothetical disease are fine. Roughly 70% of people are asymptomatic. Really serious consequences that could alter the rest of the victim\u2019s life only occur in about 0.5% of cases, and over 99.5% of patients make a full recovery. Actual mortality is even lower. The exact number varies, but even on the high end, over 99.9% people survive. Now, when I present this hypothetical disease like that, it probably doesn\u2019t sound that bad. Simply giving you those numbers without any additional context makes the disease sound pretty benign, and you might be tempted to use this \u201c>99% live\u201d argument and argue that we don\u2019t really need a massive vaccine push and should just wait for natural herd immunity. Here\u2019s the thing though. I lied when I said this was a hypothetical disease. Those are the stats for polio (CDC Pinkbook), a notoriously horrible disease that was once a scourge on our planet causing thousands of cases of paralysis and even death. It is a disease that, thanks to vaccines, we very rightly sent into oblivion in nearly every part of the world. If, however, instead of using vaccines, we had listened to this \u201c99% live\u201d argument, we would still have polio in countries like the USA, and children would still be getting infected, paralyzed, and even killed by this disease. Ninety-nine percent survival is not as high as it sounds, nor is it the only factor that has to be considered, but it can sound very persuasive when it is presented without the other necessary pieces of information. Please, keep this in mind as we now turn our attention to COVID. If you are tempted to dismiss the severity of COVID or the necessity of vaccines because COVID \u201conly\u201d kills 1% of patients, keep in mind that polio \u201conly\u201d paralyzed 0.5% of its victims and killed less than 0.1%. Note: The actual COVID case fatality rate is affected by many factors (e.g., age). As such, it is far more complicated than a simple \u201c99%,\u201d and you should not confuse that number with the notion that you personally have a 99% chance of survival. Nevertheless, 99% is the number I keep seeing people use, and it is a rough approximation of an average for many parts of the world, so for simplicity, I will continue using it here. Infection prevalence matters One of the key problems with the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it completely ignores the importance of transmissibility and infection prevalence (i.e., how easily a disease can spread). You see, a disease can be a serious threat to a population (in terms of mortality) either by having a high case fatality rate (i.e., killing a large percentage of patients) or by being highly contagious (i.e., infecting a large number of people), and case fatality rates can be very misleading by themselves. Consider, for example, two hypothetical diseases (A and B). A has an extremely high case fatality rate of 100%, but it is not very contagious and has a very low prevalence in the population. Only about 1 in 1 million people will catch it. In contrast, disease B has a much lower case fatality rate (1%), but is extremely contagious, and about 1 in 10 people will catch it. This means that in a population of 10 million people, disease A will kill 10 people, whereas disease B will kill 10 thousand people! So, which of those diseases should you be more concerned about? Obviously disease B is more concerning, right? You are at a higher risk of dying form disease B, even though 99% of patients survive. Why? Because it is so common. If you admit this basic fact, that disease B would be more concerning than disease A, then you have just admitted that case fatality rate is not sufficient in and of itself to tell you how concerning a disease is. If we had relied only on case fatalities, we would have incorrectly concluded that disease A was the bigger risk. This clearly demonstrates that the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is not a good argument, because we have to look at other factors besides just survivorship (the opposite of case fatalities), and even a disease with a 99% survival rate can be very dangerous to both populations at large and you personally if it is highly contagious. To put it simply, when considering risk, you need to consider both how likely you are to be infected, and how likely you are to die (or suffer serious consequences) if you are infected. In the case of COVID19, a large part of why it is so dangerous is its high rate of transmission, with new variants like the Delta strain making the situation even worse. That is why it has been able to kill over 4 million people world-wide, with over 600,000 deaths in the US alone. Those are sobering numbers, which should really make you stop and think long and hard about the veracity of the \u201c99% survival\u201d argument. To me, it seems self-evident that a disease that has already killed over 600,000 people in the US alone is a serious problem that merits something like a massive vaccination campaign, and the argument that the disease is not dangerous\/doesn\u2019t merit vaccines is clearly flawed. Indeed, in 2020, COVID was the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA, behind only cancer and heart disease (Ahmad and Anderson 2021), and in early 2021, it spiked to the #1 cause of death in the US (a situation that is no longer the case thanks in part to vaccines). That\u2019s what COVID looks like when it is not controlled by measures like vaccines, and it should be abundantly apparent from that situation that simply having a 99% survival rate does not mean that a disease isn\u2019t a serious threat. Indeed, if you are going to argue that we don\u2019t need to be that worried about COVID 19, then you had better make that same argument about literally every other cause of death, because when allowed to spread, COVID kills more than any of them (or if you want to arbitrarily restrict yourself to the 2020 data, you\u2019d better make that argument about every cause of death other than cancer and heart disease). To put all of that another way, a 99% survival rate is only comforting if the spread of the disease is being controlled by something like vaccines. A 99% survival rate without vaccines still results in hundreds of thousands of people dying. That is a simple fact. Natural herd immunity is a misnomer Proponents of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument often say that we will eventually achieve natural herd immunity, at which point people will be protected even without vaccines. Let me briefly explain why that is a terrible idea. The term \u201cherd immunity\u201d really only makes sense within the context of vaccines. Vaccine-induced herd immunity = a population that is protected from a disease. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d = a survivorship bias in which the survivors of the outbreak are protected from future infection and many previous herd members died. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d is a bloodbath. It\u2019s a nonsense term. Estimates for what it would take to achieve herd immunity to COVID vary, but even at the (probably) unrealistically low end of 60% immune, getting there in the US without vaccines would involve the deaths of roughly 2 million Americans! At what is probably the more realistic threshold of 90% immune, without vaccines, we are looking at about ~3 million dead Americans. That\u2019s not herd immunity; that\u2019s herd culling. Alternatively, we can achieve actual herd immunity with vaccines without killing 2\u20133 million people. Disease risk is more than just death One of the many deceptive aspects of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it acts as if COVID infection is a strictly binary situation: either you die or you are totally fine. That is, however, a completely false dichotomy. Since when is death the only outcome we care about? Many people who catch COVID live, but still undergo tremendous suffering physically, mentally, and financially. When we are considering the risks and benefits of something like a vaccine for COVID, we should not just look at whether or not you are likely to die. Things like time off work and physical suffering matter. There is a vast spectrum of responses from \u201ctotally fine\u201d to \u201calive, but extreme suffering (and in the US, often financial difficulty).\u201d Good estimates of hospitalization rates are a bit hard to come by, and are usually expressed in terms of rate per population size, not rate per infection, but by taking the cumulative overall hospitalization rate per 100,000 people from the CDC, the US population size, and the cumulative cases in the US, we find that roughly 5% of COVID cases result in hospitalizations. A scientific study using more sophisticated methods provides a similar estimate of 4.5% (Reese et al. 2020) [note: as with the case fatality rate, these are crude rates for the whole population and actual rates vary by age group]. Indeed, COVID is so rampant, that roughly 0.5% of the entire US population has been hospitalized for it. That\u2019s actually an incredible number. One out of every 200 people in America has been hospitalized for COVID (again if we average across the population), and that\u2019s just actual hospitalizations, many more have been at home sick, took time off work, etc. Further, the complications from the disease can be serious. COVID can set off a cytokine storm that affects multiple of your body\u2019s major systems. It\u2019s too early to know exactly what that means long-term, but based on what we know about COVID and other viral diseases, there is good reason to be concerned that many people who survive will have long-term lung and heart issues (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). To be clear, we need to wait for more data before knowing for sure if there will be long-term complications, but the reasonably high probability that there will be is certainly something to think about when considering the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and it\u2019s something that is completely ignored by this unreasonably simplistic \u201c99% survive\u201d argument. Vaccines: benefits outweigh the risks Finally, let\u2019s briefly turn our attention to the COVID vaccines. This would take many posts to cover in proper detail, so I\u2019ll try to be brief and just hit the key points. All vaccines have side effects, but serious side effects are rare, and your risk of a getting COVID and having a serious complication from it is much higher than your risk of a serious complication from vaccines. Countries with large vaccination programs (e.g., Israel; Rossman et al. 2020) are seeing massive drops in COVID infection, hospitalization, and death rates thanks to vaccines, and there has not been a comparable increase in injuries, hospitalizations, and deaths from vaccines. In other words, the vaccines are reducing risk. In the USA, an analysis of data in May (by which time roughly 40% of the country had received both doses of the vaccine and 50% had at least one dose) found that out of over 107,000 COVID hospitalizations, fewer than 1,200 were for vaccinated individuals, and out of 18,000 COVID deaths, only ~150 of them were for vaccinated individuals. In other words, over 99% of COVID deaths were from unvaccinated individuals, as were nearly 99% of COVID hospitalizations. That trend has continued, and now with over half the country fully vaccinated, officials like Dr. Fauci are likewise reporting that over 99% of COVID deaths and over 97% of COVID hospitalizations are from the unvaccinated. The vaccines clearly work. Further, we have not seen hospitalization or mortality rates from vaccine side effects rising to meet those numbers. In other words, with roughly half the population vaccinated, if the vaccine was truly more dangerous than the disease, we should see vaccine deaths and serious injuries at a rate that exceeds the rate for COVID. So where are the >18,000 individuals in May who died from the vaccine? Where are the >100,000 hospitalizations from the vaccine? They don\u2019t exist, because serious side effects are extremely rare. This clearly shows that your total risk is lower with the vaccine than without it. These numbers make that undeniable. Yes, the disease has a ~99% survival, and yes, the vaccine does have side effects, but the disease is exceptionally common, and series side effects of the vaccine are exceptionally rare, which, when taken together, results in your risk of serious injury or death being substantially lower when you have the vaccine. Just to really drive this home, let\u2019s look specifically at myocarditis following the mRNA vaccines. It is still not entirely clear if this is actually a side effect of the vaccines, but there is growing evidence that it is causal. Exact rates vary, but every calculation shows them to be low (Shay et al. 2021). A large data set from Israel reported a mere 148 cases within 30 days of vaccination out of over 5 million people who were vaccinated (Israel Ministry of Health). Even if all of those were caused by the vaccine, that would be a rate of 0.003%! Further, 95% of those cases were mild. In the USA, with over 150 million people vaccinated, using data from VAERS (much of which has not been verified), the WHO calculated the following myocarditis rates per fully vaccinated individual: 0.041% for males aged 12\u201329, 0.004% for females aged 12\u201329, and 0.002% for males and females over 29. Further, again, most of those cases were mild and did not require serious medical intervention. I have not so far seen any confirmed deaths from this. In contrast, COVID has a case fatality rate of ~1%. Now, I hear you saying, \u201cbut I am a male under 30, which means I\u2019m at a low risk of death from COVID and higher risk of myocarditis, so for me the risk outweighs the benefit,\u201d however, that math still doesn\u2019t work. From the start of the outbreak in the US (based on the current CDC data), there have been 2,462 deaths from COVID in males under 30, and 1,594 deaths in females under 30. There is no evidence to suggest that the vaccines are causing comparable carnage. Scientists actually ran the numbers on this and calculated that for males under 30, every 1 million second doses of an mRNA vaccine will result in 39\u201347 cases of myocarditis, but will prevent 11,000 COVID cases, 560 hospitalizations, 138 ICU admissions, and 6 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021). Also, remember again that most of these myocarditis cases are mild, whereas for COVID, even just the expected number of ICU admissions is 3 times the number of mostly mild myocarditis cases! Further, that is for a group with a relatively low COVID risk and relatively high myocarditis risk. The benefits of the vaccine are even more exaggerated for other groups. In men over 29, for example, 1 million second doses will only result in 3\u20134 cases of myocarditis, and will prevent 15,300 COVID cases, 4,598 hospitalizations, 1,242 ICU admissions, and 700 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021)! Also, notice how those who like to cast aspersions on vaccines try to downplay death from COVID while hyping mostly mild injury from the vaccine. Indeed, this \u201c99% survive\u201d argument would have us believe that a 1% fatality is too low to be seriously concerned, but a 0.002\u20130.041% rate of generally mild myocarditis is unacceptably high. It is crazy to think that 3\u20134 mostly mild cases of myocarditis is worse than 700 deaths! That\u2019s simply not how math works. The numbers are undeniable: your personal risk* is lower with the vaccine than without the vaccine, even though \u201c99% of people survive.\u201d I\u2019ve been focusing on the concerns around Pfizer and Moderna because those are the prominent vaccines where most of my readers are, but we can do the same sorts of calculations with any of the vaccines currently available. They all have various risks, but in every case, the risks associate with not getting the vaccine outweigh the risks associated with getting it. *Obviously some people have pre-existing conditions that make vaccines dangerous for them. That is not what I am talking about here. I am addressing people who have no known health conditions that would prevent them from getting the vaccine. Conclusion In summary, the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument completely ignores the high prevalence of COVID and completely ignores the importance of non-lethal effects (including hospitalization, possibly long-term effects, time off work, etc.). Further, using this argument against the necessity for vaccines massively and inappropriately downplays the risk from COVID while exaggerating the risks from vaccines. The empirical reality is that COVID is very dangerous, with over 600,000 dead in the US alone, whereas the vaccines are very safe. Given that over 50% of the US population is currently vaccinated, if the vaccines were truly more dangerous than the risk from getting COVID, we\u2019d expect the rates of vaccine deaths and serious injuries to be surpassing the rates of deaths and serious injuries from COVID. In reality we are, of course, not seeing anything even remotely like that. Deaths and serious injury from COVID remain common in the unvaccinated, whereas serious injuries from the vaccines are extremely rare and deaths virtually unheard of. I think part of the problem is that we often view taking an action as the inherently riskier choice. After all, you can\u2019t get myocarditis from the vaccine if you never get the vaccine. That reasoning, while understandable, ignores the fact that not getting the vaccine is also an action, and that action puts you at a much greater risk of death or serious illness. Indeed, that risk from COVID is so great, and the risk from vaccines is so small, that even if you are young and healthy, the risk associated with not getting the vaccine is far higher than the risk associated with getting the vaccine. This is a mathematical fact. Please read this post before making an argument about \u201cunknown long-term effects\u201d from vaccines. Related Posts Literature Cited Advertisement",

        "text":"Concern over unknown, future side effects is by far the most common reason I hear people give for why they aren\u2019t vaccinating against COVID. At a quick glance, that may seem reasonable, but when you start really looking into the science, it quickly becomes clear that there is simply no reason to suspect that there will be dangerous long-term consequences of these vaccines. Indeed, based on everything we know about the immune system, vaccines in general, and these vaccines specifically, it is extremely unlikely that they will cause unknown, serious, wide-spread side effects in the future, and the known risks from COVID far outweigh the hypothetical risks from the vaccines. In this post, I\u2019m going to carefully go over the science and logic that allows us to be so confident in the long-term safety of these vaccines, but before I do that, I want to briefly explain who my target audience is here, namely, the \u201cvaccine hesitant.\u201d I am refereeing to the people who usually would not consider themselves \u201canti-vaccers\u201d and would usually vaccinate themselves and their children but have been swept up in the maelstrom of misinformation and fear about the new COVID vaccines. If you are someone who is truly seeking information and trying to think for yourself, then please hear me out and seriously consider the arguments and evidence that I am going to present. Do not give in to the baseless fearmongering that is rampaging through the internet and media. To that end, I want to point out right at the start that this tactic of stirring up fear of future, unknown, long-term consequences is not new or unique to COVID vaccines. It is straight out of the traditional anti-vaccine playbook. It is something I was writing about long before COVID, and the argument is just as flawed now as it was then. So, if you are someone who eschews the title \u201canti-vaccer,\u201d but are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of the arguments about unknown, long-term effects, please realize that these are not new arguments that arose out of legitimate concerns specifically about COVID vaccines. Rather, stoking fear of future unknowns is a standard (and flawed) anti-vaccer tactic that they have been using for decades and are now dressing up and presenting as if it is a novel concern for COVID vaccines. Do not be fooled by this tactic. This post is necessarily long, because there\u2019s a lot to talk about in order to cover this topic properly, but, again, I have written this for people who are truly trying to think for themselves, and are truly seeking information. So if that is you, please read this carefully in its entirety. Because of the length of this post, I will summarize key points in bullets below, before elaborating on each of them. Summary: TL;DR mRNA vaccines have been being studied for over a decade (including human trials). Current COVID vaccines have been extremely well studied, with sample sizes of hundreds of thousands of people, and studies have been compiled into large meta-analyses\/systematic reviews. Thus, the short-term risks of the vaccines are extremely well-documented, and the benefits outweigh the risks. The only \u201cunknown\u201d is about long-term effects; however\u2026 No vaccine has ever caused the type of widespread, serious side effect years down the road that everyone is afraid of. Nearly all side effects occur shortly after vaccination (see #2). The only example of a sided effect that showed up months later appear within a year (whereas we\u2019ve been using COVID vaccines for over a year) and was rare. The vaccine benefits still outweighed the risks. Vaccines rarely cause long-term (future) side effects because they use low doses over a short time. Vaccines simply train your immune system. Vaccines are quickly removed from the body. Most vaccine components were well-studied, and their safety is known. mRNA: mRNA does not alter your DNA. mRNA is very quickly broken down and removed. mRNA in vaccines cannot make your body produce entire viruses. You are constantly exposed to mRNA from viruses (e.g., from colds) If you catch COVID, your cells will use viral mRNA to make proteins just like they do from the vaccine, but\u2026 Your cells will make entire viruses, not just a single protein. You will be exposed to far higher levels of mRNA. Side effects from immune stimulation will usually happen right away and will usually be worse from actual infection with COVID. A demand for long-term studies is meaningless unless you can justify why a particular length of time is needed. No matter how long something has been studied, it is always technically possible that an effect won\u2019t show up until slightly after the length of that study. This is true for all medications, foods, minerals, vitamins, etc., yet we don\u2019t fear most of them. Therefore, you must provide actual evidence or reasoning to think that a futre side-effect is actually likely. Focusing on a highly-unlikely, unknown, hypothetical risk from the vaccine while downplaying the very real and serious risk from COVID is bad risk assessment. Fears over unknown long-term effects of the vaccines are baseless. The burden of proof is on anyone claiming that the vaccines are dangerous. Not as new as you might think Before we go into the details of the COVID vaccines, we need some background information to put them in context, and I think it is important to point out that these vaccine technologies are not as new as people are often led to believe. Sure, these exact vaccines were developed recently, but mRNA vaccines have been being developed and tested for years. Thus, the underlying technology is well-studied. Let me direct you to a review paper published in 2018 (before COVID) titled, \u201cmRNA vaccines \u2014 a new era in vaccinology\u201d (Pardi et al. 2018). This review covers over a decade of research on mRNA vaccines, including safety and efficiency trials on mice (Fleeton 2001; Geall et al. 2012; Magini et al. 2016), ferrets (Brazzoli et al. 2015), pigs (Schnee et al. 2016), monkeys (Brito et al. 2014), and yes, even humans (Craenenbroeck et al. 2015; Bahl 2017; Alberer et al. 2017). As you\u2019d expect in a rapidly growing field, even more studies were published following that review, (but prior to COVID). Feldman et al. (2019), for example tested mRNA influenza vaccines in over 200 people, including following them for a full year after the vaccines to assess safety and effectiveness. Similarly, studies like Alberer et al. (2017) followed patients for a year prior to publishing and continued to follow them after publication. To be clear, those human trials were small trials; my point is simply that we were able to develop these COVID vaccines so quickly not by rushing, but rather by utilizing a robust body of research that had already been conducted. All of the information was there, waiting to be applied to something like COVID. The way that people (including politicians and the media) are talking about these vaccines, you\u2019d think that they represent totally uncharted territory. Reading the comments on my page, people are acting like we have almost no knowledge about them and are shooting in the dark, recklessly plowing into the unknown, but that\u2019s simply not true. In reality, we knew a ton about mRNA vaccines before COVID, and that should really change your perspective on these vaccines. It is so easy to give into fear of the unknown, particularly when you are so constantly bombarded with people\u2019s concerns. I don\u2019t blame anyone for that;\u2019 it\u2019s human nature, but it\u2019s important that we use logic and facts to overcome our base fears, and if you step back and start to rationally look at the wealth of knowledge these vaccines were based on (including human trials spanning a year or more), that really should paint these vaccines in a different light and help to alleviate those fears. Note that I only cited a small handful of the studies that had been conducted prior to COVID. What we know: proximate (short-term) side effects The crux of the concern over these vaccines is fear of the unknown, so before we can talk about the unknown, we need to be clear on what we do know, as well as clearly defining what we mean by \u201cunknown, long-term effects.\u201d There are basically two categories of effects we need to talk about: Proximate effects (short-term) = effects that first occur shortly after vaccination Unknown future effects (long-term) = effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination (Note 1) It is important to make this distinction, because I often find that people meander back and forth between these two without having a clear understanding of what is actually known or how it is known. So let me try to be as clear as possible: we have an extremely robust understanding of proximate effects, and the fact that the vaccines are new is 100% irrelevant. Proximate effects are fairly straightforward to test. First, scientists conduct phase 1\u20133 human trials using a randomized, placebo-controlled approach, where they follow thousands of patients for several weeks following vaccination. Then, once the vaccine is released to the general public, scientists continue to monitor it for side effects using things like large cohort studies and case-controlled studies. As the sample sizes increase, so does our ability to detect increasingly rare events. With tens of thousands of participants, we can detect events that occur every few thousand people, but we will miss events that happen once for every 10,000 people. At a few hundred thousand people, we can detect events that occur once per tens of thousands of people, but will miss events that happen once for every 100,000 people, etc. (Note: numbers are approximations). There are two critical points here. First, because our ability to detect rare side effects is dependent on sample size, as the sample size increases, any new side effects will, by definition, be increasingly rare. By the time we are into the millions (as we are with COVID vaccines) we aren\u2019t going to suddenly find a new common serious side effect, because those would have been picked up at much smaller sample sizes. Second, the novelty of the vaccines is completely and totally irrelevant. Because we are talking about events that happen within a few weeks of being vaccinated, it does not matter if the vaccines have been available for two months or two hundred years. The only thing that matters is the sample size (i.e., number of participants). Let me say that again (in bold), our ability to confidently know the rates of proximate side effects depends entirely on the sample size; the age of the vaccine is 100% irrelevant. In the case of COVID, we were able to get these sample sizes extremely quickly because there were so many cases of COVID and governments dumped so much money into massive vaccine campaigns. All of the currently recommended vaccines passed their initial phase 3 trials with large sample sizes. For example, Pfizer used over 43,000 participants (Polack et al. 2020), and Moderna used over 30,000 (Mahase 2020). Following those phase 3 trials, numerous large studies have been released. Indeed, so many studies have been conducted that we can do systematic reviews and meta-analyses. As explained here, these combine the data from multiple studies to look for overarching effects and are the highest level of scientific evidence. Qianhui et al. (2021), for example, included 87 different safety studies, and concluded that, \u201cAvailable evidence indicates that eligible COVID-19 vaccines have an acceptable short-term safety profile.\u201d Yet more studies have been conducted since that review\/meta-analysis, and some of them are truly massive. Barda et al. (2021), for example, compared over 800,000 vaccinated individuals to over 800,000 unvaccinated individuals to look at the rates of adverse events from the Pfizer vaccine as well as the rates of those same events in people who develop COVID. Not only did the vaccine have low rates of serious side effects, but, for most conditions (including myocarditis and myocardial infarction), the rates of those events were higher in people who caught COVID than in people who received vaccines (Note 2). Other calculations of the rates of specific adverse events have had even large sample sizes. For example, the Israel Ministry of Health used over 5 million people to calculate the rate of myocarditis following vaccination. Similarly, in the USA, the CDC has several hundred million vaccine doses to use in its calculations. The point is that we are extremely confident about the short-term consequences of the vaccines. It\u2019s hard to overstate the massive volume of data we have. Barda et al. (2021), for example, is one of largest cohort studies I have ever read. It is larger than most studies on the safety of well-established vaccines that have been available for decades. Indeed, we have been able to quickly collect so much data that our knowledge of the short-term safety of COVID vaccines is equal to or greater than our knowledge of the short-term safety of many standard vaccines. Again, to be 100% clear, the fact that the vaccines are relatively new simply does not matter for these short-term effects. Further, these studies aren\u2019t the result of \u201crushing.\u201d Rather, it is simply matter of vaccinating so many people so quickly that we were able to rapidly collect the data that would usually take years to accumulate. It is the size and volume of the studies that matters, and we have numerous truly massive studies unequivocally showing that serious side effects are rare and the benefits outweigh the risks. To put it simply, the short-term side effects of the COVID vaccines have been thoroughly studied and are extremely well-documented. Scientifically, these vaccines are no longer experimental (with the exception of their application to young children, in some cases). They have already passed numerous experiments and the evidence is clear (Pfizer isn\u2019t \u201cexperimental\u201d legally either). Insisting that we haven\u2019t studied the vaccines well-enough to know the short-term side effects is, at this stage, science denial. See Note 3 regarding the supposed vaccine-related deaths and injuries reported in VAERS. Vaccines don\u2019t cause wide-spread, long-term adverse events Now we can finally turn our attention specifically to the topic of unknown, long-term effects (which, remember, are effects that do not show up for months or years after vaccination; Note 1). I realize I took a long time getting here, but that background was important, because I have shown that we have a massive body of studies showing that the COVID vaccines have few serious side effects shortly after receiving them. Thus, the only way to doubt their safety without outright science denial is to raise concerns over presently unknown, long-term effects, but, as I will show, those concerns have no scientific merit. The type of future long-term consequence that everyone seems so afraid of (i.e., the type that only manifests months or years down the road) is virtually unheard of from vaccines. I looked long and hard for examples of this occurring, and in the entire history of vaccines, I was only able to find one: Pandemrix, an H1N1 vaccine used in Europe for the 2009\u20132010 flu season was associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy that usually only manifested weeks or months after the vaccine. You can read more details on Thoughtscapism and Skeptical Raptor, but there are just three points I want to make. Depending on the study, the lag between vaccination and onset of narcolepsy was 0-242 days (median = 42; Partinen et al. 2012) or 0-360 days (median not reported; Nohynek et al. 2012). Pfizer and Moderna both began their phase 3 COVID vaccine trials on 27 July 2020 (~400 days ago) and received emergency use authorization (thus starting mass vaccination campaigns in the USA) in December 2020 (~260 days ago). Indeed, Israel had already administered over 1 million doses by the end of 2020. This means we are already past the time frame where we should have started picking up something comparable to the long-term effects of Pandemrix. As is so often the case with vaccine side effects, the disease they prevent (influenza in this case) also causes the same side effect. This side effects was rare (between 1 in 52,000 doses and 1 in 57,500 doses in England [Miller et al. 2013] and 1 in 16,000 in Finland [Nohynek et al. 2012; for unclear reasons, Finland had a high rate that could not be generalized to other countries), and the benefits of the vaccine still outweighed the risk. That last point is really important, because for it to turn out that avoiding the COVID vaccines was the safer choice, unknown future side effects would not only have to exist, but they would have to be so common and so serious that they outweigh the enormous known benefits of the vaccines, and that is a situation that has never occurred for any vaccine (Note 4). For reasons that I\u2019ll explain in the next sections, that\u2019s simply not how vaccines interact with the body. So, if you are avoiding the COVID vaccines because of a fear of unknown, serious, long-term side effects, ask yourself, is that fear really rational given that future, long-term side effects of vaccines are virtually unheard of, and there has never been a case where those side effects were widespread and outweighed the benefits of the vaccines? Why vaccines don\u2019t cause future long-term effects: Low dose, short exposure Let\u2019s now talk about why vaccine side effects nearly always show up shortly after vaccination. The type of long-term consequence we are talking about typically comes from one of two causes: a very large dose over a short time, or a small dose over a prolonged period of time. Vaccines don\u2019t fit either of those categories. They are fundamentally different from most medications because they simply train your immune system before being quickly removed. Your own immune system is what provides a lasting benefit. Further, vaccines do this via low, non-toxic doses. Remember, the dose makes the poison. Everything, even water (Garigan and Ristedt 1999), is toxic at a high enough dose and safe at a low enough dose. So people who scream about \u201cTOXIC CHEMICALS\u201d in vaccines are ignoring basic chemistry. There is no such thing as a toxic chemical, there are only toxic doses, and the doses in vaccines are not toxic. One of the most common arguments I hear people making to justify concerns over COVID vaccines is, \u201clook at all the examples of drugs that were approved, then years later long-term effects were found.\u201d Those examples are, however, nearly always for drugs that were taken repeatedly. It\u2019s the cumulative effect that causes the risk (particularly for chemicals that persist in your body for long periods of time). Vaccines, in contrast, have limited exposure, and your body quickly eliminates them. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, the vaccine itself has been totally eliminated from your body. The long-term protection comes from immune system memory, not from the vaccines themselves. This is really important, because it means we don\u2019t have a mechanism through which COVID vaccines would cause long-term harm. Because vaccines are a low doses given 2-3 times, we expect any consequences to happen quickly, which is exactly what we find. The most common side effects are things like soreness and moderate flu symptoms that start within a few hours or days of receiving the vaccine. These effects aren\u2019t because the vaccine is \u201ctoxic\u201d but rather because it is doing exactly what it was designed to do and stimulating your immune system. It\u2019s that activation of your immune system that makes you feel unwell, but that activation is critical, because it is how your immune system learns to identify and fight COVID. Similarly, serious side effects from the vaccines, while rare, usually show up shortly after vaccination. Side effects that don\u2019t show up for months or years simply aren\u2019t expected from vaccines because of how vaccines work. Nevertheless, in the following sections, let\u2019s look more closely at the three main hypothetical sources of long-term harm: adjuvants\/preservatives, mRNA, and immune activation. #1: Adjuvants and preservatives Vaccines typical consist of three basic components: a representation of the infectious agent (antigens, weakened viruses, virus particles, mRNA, etc.), an adjuvant that simulates the immune system and\/or aids in delivery of the antigen, mRNA, etc., and preservatives (usually salts, metals, and sugars) to avoid contamination and stabilize the other components. The later two categories (adjuvants and preservatives) are historically the things that anti-vaccers have targeted (e.g., the infamous, and completely false, accusation that thimerosal [ethyl-mercury] caused autism). These accusations have, however, never stood up to scrutiny. Vaccine components have been well-studied and are safe at the doses used in vaccines. Specifically for COVID vaccines, their components differ from one vaccine to the next, but the safety of the components is well-known. Many of them use standard salts\/metals that have been used in numerous previous vaccines and medications, and the non-mRNA vaccines usually use the adjuvants that have already been used in other vaccines. Specifically for the mRNA vaccines, they use a different type of antigen known as a \u201clipid nanoparticle\u201d (basically a small, fancy fat) that stimulates the immune system and serves as a delivery mechanism for the mRNA. These are new for a commercially available vaccines (because we\u2019ve never had commercially available mRNA vaccines before), but that doesn\u2019t make the nanoparticles themselves new, and there is a wealth of studies on them (including studies on other vaccines that have been being developed [see previous section on the history of mRNA vaccines]). See Hou et al. (2021) for an extensive review of the topic. My point is simply that while the vaccines are \u201cnew,\u201d their components have been well-studied, and there is simply no reason to think that they pose a long-term danger. #2: mRNA Now let\u2019s turn our attention to the big one that has so many people worried: mRNA. At the outset, we need to be clear on what mRNA is and which it does. Your cells contain DNA stored in the nucleus. This provides the plans for your body and how it runs, and it is what you pass on to make your offspring when you procreate. For the actual day-to-day running of your body, however, it has to be transcribed into mRNA (aka \u201cmessenger RNA\u201d). This is a single stranded copy of your double-stranded DNA. The mRNA can then leave the nucleus and go to the ribosomes (little protein factories in your cells) which translate the mRNA into amino acids which are then strung together and folded to form proteins. This is happing millions of times in your body each second. Importantly, the process does not alter your DNA. Your genetic code is unaffected. Think of it like taking a master copy of a recipe, photocopying it, then giving that photocopy to someone who then follows the instructions on it. Viruses are actually pretty neat and replicate by tapping into this system. They can\u2019t reproduce on their own. Instead, they insert their DNA or RNA into your cells and hijack your molecular machinery by making the ribosomes translate their RNA and build new virus (some viruses have DNA and require a transcription step, others [like COVID] store their genetic material as RNA). The mRNA vaccines tap into this same process. They include a small fragment of the RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus (specifically for the spike protein), thus causing your cells to produce that spike protein. Your immune system is then stimulated to attack the spike protein, and in the process, it learns to attack the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus. Take a minute to stop and marvel at the ingenuity of this system, because it\u2019s incredible. There are several important points that need to be made here: This process does not alter your DNA. The viral mRNA does not get integrated into your DNA. This is not gene therapy. All that happens is protein production by ribosomes. Again, this is like handing your cells a photocopy of a set of instructions. mRNA is a very fragile, short-lived molecule. During my PhD, I worked in a laboratory where some people do RNA research, and they often joked that if you looked at the vials the wrong way the RNA would vanish. The point is that the mRNA from the vaccines very quickly breaks down and is removed from your body. Within a few days of receiving the vaccine, it is totally gone. The vaccines only contain the mRNA for a single protein. It is impossible for them to cause your body to make the full virus. They simply don\u2019t contain that information. This is a process that is already happening constantly in your body. Right now, you almost certainly have some viruses (even if you are healthy), and those viruses are hijacking your cells with their RNA and forcing your cells to make virus for them. Indeed, unlike with the vaccine, they are making your body produce entire viruses, not just a single protein. Similarly, anytime you become infected with a cold, the flu, etc., your body is exposed to tons of viral RNA which it then translates into proteins (entire viruses) (related to #4) If you become infected with COVID, this process is going to happen anyway, but unlike with the vaccine, your cells are going to produce the entire virus, and, because the virus will be replicating, you will be exposed to substantially more viral RNA for a longer period of time. That last point is incredibly important, because it means that any fears you have about the mRNA in the vaccine should be even greater for the virus itself. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to simultaneously downplay the seriousness of COVID while fearing the mRNA in the vaccines, because if you catch COVID, you are going to be exposed to substantially higher doses of viral RNA! As you can hopefully see, none of this lends credence to the idea that the vaccine will cause long-term effects. There is simply no mechanism through which the mRNA could cause long-term harm, and even if there was a concern over long-term effects, that concern would be even higher from actually catching COVID! #3. Immune activation The final way in which vaccines could, in concept, cause harm is as a side effect of the inflammatory immune response they stimulate. Indeed, that is the cause of most vaccine side effects. The vaccine sets off a cascade of immune responses, and sometimes your body gets caught in the crossfire, though this rarely causes serious problems. Importantly, however, this happens while your immune system is being stimulated. This isn\u2019t a pathway that we would expect to not cause any noticeable problems shortly after vaccination, then suddenly cause massive problems down the road. It could, in concept, cause a problem that starts shortly after vaccination and persists long-term, but it\u2019s unlikely to cause problems that don\u2019t appear until months or years later. This is important because, again, problems that arise shortly after vaccination and persist aren\u2019t what we are talking about. Those aren\u2019t unknown. Rather, we already know that those are rare because we can detect them shortly after vaccination (see previous section on short-term studies). Finally, as I\u2019ve alluded to several times already, problems that arise as a result of immune activation should also arise as the result of actual infection with SARS-CoV-2, and they\u2019d usually be expected to be worse or more common from an actual infection. Indeed, that\u2019s exactly what Barda et al. (2021) found. So, once again, it makes no sense to fear this as a consequence of the vaccine while downplaying the seriousness of COVID, because infection with COVID is more likely to cause this problem (see Note 2 on absolute risk). How long is long enough? This is an issue that I\u2019ve written about several times before (e.g., here and here), but in short, the demand for long-term data becomes extremely problematic unless \u201clong-term\u201d is carefully defined and justified beforehand. We already have over a year of data on COVID vaccines, plus many years of data on mRNA vaccines more generally. For most scientists, based on everything we know, that is plenty long enough to be confident in the safety of these vaccines, but if you are going to claim that it is not long enough, the questions become \u201cwhy?\u201d and \u201chow long is long enough?\u201d As I said earlier, anti-vacces have used this argument against vaccines for ages, and the problem is that they constantly shift the goal posts. If you show them a 3-year study, they say, \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 5 years.\u201d If you show them a 5-year study, they say \u201cwell maybe effects don\u2019t show up until 10 years.\u201d If you show them a 10-year study, they switch to 15 years, 20 years, etc. They can keep extending it all the way until the end of the human life-span, and beyond the fact that continually shifting the goal posts is an ad hoc fallacy (and this whole thing is an argument from ignorance fallacy), demanding 15 years of data is only slightly more irrational than demanding 10 years, or even 5 years or 3 years. Really think about this. Given that no vaccine has ever had a wide-spread, serious side effect that only shows up more than a year after vaccination, what is the justification for demanding 3 years of data instead of accepting the year+ of data we have? How is the demand for 3 years of data more logical than a demand for 10 years, or 20 years, or 60 years? All of those are time categories where we\u2019ve never seen a vaccine suddenly cause new problems and for which we have zero reason to expect these vaccines to cause problems. The probability of a long-term effect only showing up over a year after vaccination is pretty close to zero, which means that it is close to zero for 3 years, 5 years, etc. Bad risk assessment As I\u2019ve shown throughout this post, there is simply no good evidence to suggest that the COVID vaccines will have serious long-term consequences that only show up in the future. It\u2019s a baseless fear. Meanwhile, we know that COVID itself is very serious. In the USA alone, it has killed over 650,000 people. In 2020, it was the third leading cause of death in the USA, and in early 2021, it briefly spiked to the #1 slot before dropping back to position #3. We should not be downplaying something that is so prevalent and deadly that it is the third leading cause of death. Further, beyond death, many people suffer serious complications from COVID, some of which will likely persist into the future (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). Therefore, based on everything we know (which is a lot), risk assessment clearly shows that you are safer with the vaccine than without it, and while it is technically possible that there will be future unknown consequences of the vaccine, these would be even more likely from COVID itself, and it is incredibly unlikely that they will happen from the vaccines and be serious and widespread enough to alter the risk assessment. By avoiding the vaccine, you are placing more weight on an unknown and unlikely hypothetical future risk than you are placing on a very real and serious known risk. See the following posts for more details including the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument, precautionary principle argument, and COVID comorbidities. Long-term fears are baseless: The burden of proof As I\u2019ve explained throughout, there is not one shred of evidence nor a single logical argument that makes it likely that the vaccines will have unknown long-term consequences. This is a completely made-up concern. This isn\u2019t a situation where we have preliminary data suggesting a concern, or a logical\/scientific basis for thinking that there is a risk. Rather, this is a concern that was pulled out of thin air with absolutely no evidence behind it. Further, to be clear, the fact that something is new does not make it likely that there are unknown long-term effects. Indeed, everything we know about vaccines and the immune system makes it extremely unlikely that there will be future, unknown, wide-spread, long-term consequences. Is it technically possible? Sure, but there are an infinite number of technically possible things that will probably never happen. \u201cTechnically possible\u201d is not a valid justification for a fear, particularly if that fear will prevent you from taking a medication that greatly lowers your risk of disease and death. For future unknown consequences to be a logically valid reason for not vaccinating, the probability of serious consequences occurring would need to be high enough to trump the massive known benefits of the vaccines. We would need some really compelling preliminary evidence to suggest that these future injuries will occur, and we simply don\u2019t have it, not one scrap of it. I say again, this is a made-up concern. Although it makes a certain amount of sense from the standpoint of the psychology of our panicky primate brains, it is a concern that is not based on any evidence or logic. You can\u2019t just make up a concern, then demand action based on that concern. You need actual evidence to support the concern. In medicine (and science more generally), it is not enough to simply say that something is technically possible. Rather, you have to show that there is a reasonable probability of it being true before it makes sense to treat it seriously (this is something known as the \u201cprior probability\u201d). Imagine, for example, that I decide that taking aspirin while drinking soda is dangerous, and when asked to justify that fear, I simply say, \u201cwell we don\u2019t know that it isn\u2019t dangerous. It\u2019s technically possible that it\u2019s dangerous, and look at how many drugs have been recalled because of some complication with another chemical.\u201d I think that we can all agree that my fear would be irrational, right? In technical terms, it would be an argument from ignorance fallacy. The fact that something is unknown, doesn\u2019t mean that I can act as if that thing is known to be dangerous. There are an infinite number of things that are unknown. There are an infinite number of potential interactions and long-term effects for all treatments, including vitamins, supplements, herbs, etc. There haven\u2019t been, for example, any 30-year studies on the effects of regularly taking most vitamins or supplements, and given that those are taken daily, they are far more likely to cause long-term issues. So why not be concerned about them? Do you see the point that I am getting at here? The fact that we haven\u2019t looked at 3-year effects of the vaccines (or 5 years, or 10 years, etc.) would only matter if we actually had evidence to suggest that there would be problems down the road, and we don\u2019t have that evidence. Indeed, all of the evidence suggests the opposite. Therefore, this is a baseless fear and the burden of proof is on those who are avoiding the vaccine based on these concerns. Now you could try to quibble with me and say that, \u201cNo one is saying that there definitely are long-term effects. We are just saying that we don\u2019t know if there are and, therefore, we should not take the vaccine until we do know.\u201d But, again, that doesn\u2019t work for all the reasons that I\u2019ve laid out. A lack of knowledge simply isn\u2019t sufficient in and of itself. This is an abuse of the precautionary principle, and although you may not be claiming that there are, in fact, long term effects, by choosing to avoid the vaccines, you are, nevertheless, acting as if there will be those effects. As explained earlier, that\u2019s bad risk assessment. I want to conclude this with some questions. If you are not vaccinating because of concerns over unknown long-term effects, ask yourself, \u201cwhy do I have those concerns?\u201d Can you point to any actual data to justify them, or is it simply a fear of the unknown? If the latter, ask yourself how likely it is that those fears will come true. The fact that something is new or unknown doesn\u2019t make it dangerous. Given the very real risk of COVID, the decade+ of research on mRNA vaccines, the decades of research on vaccines in general, the massive studies on the COVID vaccines, and the fact that no vaccine has ever had the type of serious, widespread, unknown, long-term side effect that everyone is so afraid of, does it really make rational sense to avoid the vaccines out of fear of the unknown? Does it really seem more likely that you will be injured by this totally hypothetical and unprecedented vaccine injury than by a virus that is currently the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA? Notes Note 1: When we talk about unknown long-term effects, we are not talking about adverse events that happen shortly after vaccination and continue to cause problems into the future (those are proximate events that have long-term consequences). We aren\u2019t talking about something like myocarditis which, in rare cases, occurs shortly after vaccination and (in a small subset of the most extreme cases) can cause long-term damage. We already know that those events are extremely rare, because we\u2019ve already been able to detect them. They aren\u2019t unknown. In other words, because those events are first detected shortly after vaccination, we have been able to test them with the current short-term studies and have shown that they are extremely rare. Note 2: Barda et al. (2021) was comparing rates among the vaccinated with rates among the infected, not absolute risk. Absolute risk depends on how likely you are to become infected. However, other analyses (e.g., Gargano et al. 2021) have shown that in high-risk countries like the USA, your absolute risk of serious injury and death is lower with the vaccine than without it, even if you are in a low-risk COVID group. Note 3: There are many false claims floating around about thousands of deaths following vaccination. These claims are based on VAERS which includes anything observed following vaccination and does not establish causation. With millions of people receiving vaccines, it is inevitable that a few thousand will die shortly afterwards just by chance. In the vast majority of cases, there is simply no reason to think that the vaccines were responsible. Similarly, while some of the adverse events reported in VAERS may have been caused by vaccines, most probably weren\u2019t. The database is self-reported (anyone can make entries), and some truly wacky submissions have been included. Further, again, the fact that something happened after vaccination absolutely does not mean that the vaccine caused it (that\u2019s a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy; more details here and here). To quote the CDC \u201cFDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it\u2019s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines\u201d (the bold was in the original). More details on VAERS here. Note 4: Again, to be 100% clear, we are talking about injuries that won\u2019t show up until later down the road. You certainly can find examples from decades ago where there were issues with a vaccine rollout (particularly concerning polio vaccines), but those issues were immediate, and that\u2019s not what we are talking about here. The COVID vaccines all underwent massive randomized controlled trials and have been carefully monitored following release to the public, and with the hundreds of millions of doses that we have administered, we have a very clear picture of the immediate risks and benefits. Those aren\u2019t unknowns. Related posts Literature cited Advertisement",

        "link":"https:\/\/thelogicofscience.com\/2022\/01\/19\/debunking-30-bad-arguments-about-covid-vaccines\/",
        "text":"The COVID era has been a golden age of misinformation. It has seen the development of innumerable false claims and shoddy arguments, and it has breathed new life into ancient anti-vaccine tropes. Indeed, I find it impossible to make any posts about this topic on social media without the comments immediately becoming a raging dumpster fire of falsehoods. The arguments are so innumerable that trying to debate them with someone quickly becomes an exercise in futility that feels like fighting the mighty hydra. As soon as one argument is debunked, several more pop up to take its place. This article is my attempt to ameliorate that situation by compiling most of the common arguments I encounter into a single location where they can all be debunked in one fell swoop. Because there are so many of them, I will address each one only briefly and provide citations to the relevant studies as well as links to articles that go into more detail. To those fighting the good fight against misinformation, rock on, and I hope this article will make a useful addition to your arsenal. To those who arrived on this page because someone directed you here when you made one of these bad arguments, please actually look at the evidence. Please stop listening to your favorite politician, commentator, youtuber, fringe doctor, etc. and look at the actual evidence. Many of these arguments are interrelated and somewhat redundant, but they are often presented as separate arguments, so I wanted to deal with each explicitly here. They are ordered roughly into the following categories: 1\u20138 = Arguments about COVID risk\/mortality rates 9\u201313 = Arguments based on the novelty of the vaccines 14\u201320 = Arguments about vaccine effectiveness 21\u201323 = Arguments about the reliability of science 24\u201330 = Miscellaneous: conspiracy theories, VAERS, anecdotes, etc. With that out of the way, let\u2019s do this. Bad argument #1: COVID isn\u2019t dangerous Reality: Yes it is; millions are dead Over 5.5 million people have already died, including over 850,000 in the USA alone. Something that has killed millions of people in only two years is, by definition, dangerous. Indeed, COVID was the 3rd highest cause of death in the USA in 2020 (Murphy et al. 2021) and 2021 (only cancer and heart disease were higher), and during outbreaks, it spiked to the #1 slot (see graph here). So unless you are going to tell me that accidents, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s, and every other cause of death that COVID beat aren\u2019t dangerous, please stop making the insane claim that COVID isn\u2019t dangerous. Finally, death is not the only possible negative outcome, and hospitalization, long-term effects, time off work, etc. should all be considered (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). Bad argument #2: 99.9% survive Reality: That still means millions of deaths The survival rate varies greatly among ages, populations, strains, etc. So a blanket number like this isn\u2019t accurate or useful. That is still a high death rate, and it has resulted in millions of deaths (see #1). Diseases can be very dangerous to a population either by having a high mortality rate or by having a high infection rate (or both), and COVID has a very high infection rate. If you have two diseases, one of which has a 10% mortality rate but only infects 100,000 people, and the other of which only has a 0.1% mortality rate but infects 10,000,000 people, you end up with 10,000 deaths either way. More details here Bad argument #3: People only die because of comorbidities, so the actual COVID death rate is very low\/COVID death rates are inflated by comorbidities. Reality: Comorbidities don\u2019t change the fact that these people died as a result of COVID Comorbidities are simply additional factors that contributed to a death, and their existence does not negate the critical role of COVID in those deaths. If someone with a blood clotting disorder is stabbed and bleeds to death, the clotting disorder will be listed as a comorbidity because it was a contributing factor, but it would be insane to argue that this death is \u201cinflating stabbing mortality rates\u201d or that \u201cstabbing wasn\u2019t really the cause of death, because they had a clotting disorder.\u201d The fact remains that they would not have died at that point in time if it had not been for the stabbing, and something that would have prevented the stabbing would also have prevented their death. The same is true with COVID comorbidities. In most cases, these people would not have died at this particular point in time if it wasn\u2019t for COVID. Further, a huge portion of people have conditions that predispose them to severe COVID and would count as comorbidities if they die (CDC: People with Certain Medical Conditions). More details here. Bad argument #4: It\u2019s no worse than the flu Reality: Yes it is In the United States of America, influenza kills between 12,000 and 52,000 people annually, with a total of 342,000 flu deaths from the 2010\u20132020 seasons (CDC flu data). In sharp contrast, COVID has already killed >850,000 Americans, and in 2020 alone, the USA suffered 377,883 COVID deaths (Ahmad et al. 2021), with an even higher number of deaths in 2021. In other words, COVID kills more people in a single year than the flu kills in a decade. So please stop with this nonsense that it is no worse than the flu. Bad argument #5: I\u2019m young and healthy, so I don\u2019t need a vaccine Reality: You can still become seriously ill and\/or spread it to others Being young and healthy lowers your risk, but it does not eliminate it. There are thousands of previously young healthy people who have died of COVID, and thousands more who became seriously ill (see CDC data). Further, young healthy people can still spread it to those who aren\u2019t young and healthy (see #). Also see #25 Bad argument #6: I trust my immune system, so I don\u2019t need vaccines Reality: Your immune system is only as good as its training Even a healthy immune system has to learn how to fight a novel disease before it can do so effectively. Vaccines simply train your immune system so that it knows how to fight a disease like COVID when it encounters the real thing. This argument is about like saying, \u201cI trust the military, so I don\u2019t think they need intelligence reports on the enemy.\u201d Details here Bad argument #7: Humans have survived for thousands of years without vaccines Reality: The species has lived, but millions of individuals have died. Homo sapiens as a species has survived, but countless individuals died, and since their invention, vaccines have saved untold millions of lives. No one is saying that COVID is going to wipe us our as a species. Rather, we are saying that millions of individuals could be saved with the vaccines. More details here Bad argument #8: Maybe previous strains were dangerous, but Omicron isn\u2019t Reality: Omicron is less dangerous, but still dangerous Early evidence does suggest that Omicron is less deadly than other strains, but that does not mean it isn\u2019t dangerous. Further, the current data also suggest that it is more easily transmitted, which means that your total risk may still be high, because risk is determined by the combination of the probability of catching the disease and probability of serious injury or death if you catch the disease (see #2). Further, even a less-deadly strain can still have substantial impacts by flooding hospitals with thousands of infected patients, which is exactly what is happening. Indeed, the USA just set a new record for hospitalized COVID patients, and remember that deaths always lag behind infections and hospitalizations. Bad argument #9: The vaccines alter your DNA Reality: mRNA cannot alter your DNA, and this is not genetic engineering. DNA is the master copy of your genetic material and is stored in your cells\u2019 nuclei. Think of DNA like the original architectural plans for a building. To make proteins, that double-stranded DNA gets transcribed in single-stranded RNA, and the RNA is then transported to ribosomes which use it as the plans for making proteins. Think of RNA like the blueprints used at a worksite that have been copied from the master plans. Thus, mRNA does not alter your DNA, because that\u2019s simply not what RNA does. Further, you get exposed to substantially more COVID mRNA during an actual COVID infection, and your body is already teaming with RNA from the millions of micro-organisms that live in and on you. More details here Bad argument #10: The vaccines are too new\/rushed Reality: No, they aren\u2019t\/weren\u2019t More details here and here Bad argument #11: We don\u2019t know the long-term effects Reality: Yes, we do No vaccine has ever caused a serious, unpredicted adverse event that only showed years down the road. That is simply not how vaccines work. Because vaccines train the immune system before being quickly eliminated, their effects happen quickly (within minutes or days, not years later). We now have way more than enough data to be highly confident in the safety of these vaccines (see #10). This concern is completely unjustified and has no scientific basis. Further, if we are going to play the game of fearing the unknown, it is far more likely that COVID itself will have long-term adverse effects than it is that the vaccines will. More details here and here Bad argument #12: My children and I aren\u2019t lab rats and won\u2019t take an experimental vaccine Reality: The vaccines have already passed experimental testing Again, these vaccines have been thoroughly studied using massive sample sizes (see # 10). They are no longer experimental. They have passed the experimental stage. So this argument is nonsense. It blindly ignores all of those studies. Bad argument #13: Children and pregnant women shouldn\u2019t be vaccinated Reality: They are safer with vaccines Hospitalization and death from COVID are less common in children, but they still happen, which is both tragic and preventable. The vaccines have been tested in children, and are safe and effective, resulting in 10x lower risk of hospitalization (Delahoy et al. 2021, Olson et al. 2022, Principi and Esposito 2022, Stein et al. 2022). In contrast to children, pregnant women are actually at an increased risk of serious adverse events from COVID, but like children, the vaccines have been well-studied, and a large study (>40,000 participants) found that COVID19 vaccination is safe during pregnancy (Lipkind et al. 2022). Bad argument #14: The vaccines aren\u2019t 100% effective Reality: Nothing is 100% effective, but they are still very useful This one is an anti-vaccer classic that has been around for ages. The reality is that almost nothing is 100% effective. Helmets, parachutes, seat belts, air bags, birth control, etc. are all less than 100% effective, yet clearly the are very useful. Risk is inherently about probabilities, not absolutes. So, when we talk about how well vaccines work, we are always talking about risk reduction, not risk elimination, and the vaccines do greatly reduce risk (see #10, 15, 16). More details here and here. Bad argument #15: The vaccines don\u2019t prevent you from getting COVID (breakthrough cases) Reality: They reduce risk and severity Again, almost nothing is 100% effective (see #14), but the vaccines reduce your risk. This has been borne out by study (Polack et al. 2020) after study (Mahase 2020) after study (Fowlkes et al. 2021) after study (Mart\u00ednez-Baz et al. 2021). Further, even if you become infected, the vaccines dramatically reduce your risk of getting a serious infection, and the rates of hospitalizations and deaths are substantially lower among the vaccinated than among the unvaccinated (Mart\u00ednez-Baz et al. 2021, Self et al. 2021, Tenforde et al. 2021). Indeed, the CDC data (COVID tracker) for October (the most recent complete month at the time I\u2019m writing this; see update below) showed that, compared to vaccinated individuals, unvaccinated individuals were 5 times more likely to test positive for COVID and 14 times more likely to die from COVID (also see Yek et al. 2022)! This argument is like saying, \u201ccar safety features like ABS brakes, seat belts, and air bags don\u2019t prevent you from getting into a car accident.\u201d Sure, they don\u2019t completely prevent it, but some of them (e.g., brakes), make it less likely, and even if you are in an accident, they greatly reduce the risk that you will be seriously injured by the accident. If you\u2019ve ever had to do a risk assessment for a job, you know that risk involves both the likelihood of an event and severity if the event occurs. Update 30-1-2022: The updated CDC data (going through December 25 2021) show that the unvaccinated are 13X more likely to test positive for COVID and 68X more likely to die from COVID, compared to people with three doses of the vaccine. Bad argument #16: The vaccines don\u2019t prevent you from spreading (transmitting) COVID Reality: They reduce risk of transmission Vaccinated individuals can spread the virus, but you have to be infected with COVID before you can spread COVID, and the vaccines greatly reduce your risk of becoming infected (see #15). Further, multiple studies (some of them quite large) have compared the COVID infection rates among family members of people who did or did not receive the vaccine, and exactly as you\u2019d expect from herd immunity, infection rates were lower for the people with a vaccinated family member (Anoop et al. 2021, Geir et al. 2021a, Geir et al. 2021b, Singanayagam et al. 2021). So yes, breakthrough cases do happen (see #15) because nothing is 100% effective (see#14), but again, the risk is greatly reduced by the vaccines, and the data are unequivocal: vaccinating protects those around you. Bad argument #17: Most people who catch COVID are vaccinated Reality: You have to look at ratios, not raw numbers This claim is often untrue, but even when it is true, that is only because most people are vaccinated. We have to look at the rates not the raw numbers. By way of analogy, most car accidents involve sober drivers, but that doesn\u2019t mean it is safer to drive drunk; it\u2019s simply that most people drive sober, and we can see this when we look at the rates. Even so, when it comes to vaccines, the rates (infections per person) clearly show that the vaccines work and reduce risk (Polack et al. 2020, Mahase 2020, Fowlkes et al. 2021, Mart\u00ednez-Baz et al. 2021, see #10 and 15). More details here and here Bad argument #18: The vaccines are less effective against Omicron Reality: They still help, and boosters largely restore effectiveness Omicron is still too new for us to have a completely clear picture of this. Current evidence does suggest that the vaccines are less effective against omicron than they were against delta (particularly when it comes to completely preventing asymptomatic infection, but see #20 regarding boosters), but they current evidence also suggests that they still greatly reduce your risk of getting a serious infection that would require hospitalization. Indeed, a report that was just released by the UK Health Security Agency (2021) found that 3 doses of the vaccine were 88% effective at preventing hospitalization from omicron. Similarly, data from South Africa showed that even just two doses of the Pfizer vaccine resulted in 70% effectiveness at preventing hospitalization from omicron (Collie et al. 2021). See #20 on boosters Bad argument #19: If vaccines work, why do you care if I am vaccinated? Reality: Because I care about others Vaccines greatly reduce risk, but they aren\u2019t 100% effective (see #14\u201316). Many people can\u2019t be vaccinated due to medical issues, but when everyone else is vaccinated, they are protected by herd immunity. Outbreaks can overwhelm the medical system and prevent others from getting the treatments they need (multiple uninfected people have died because of this; Sabbatini, et al. 2021). When most people are vaccinated, the risk of new strains emerging is reduced because it is harder for the virus to replicate (which is where new mutations come from) and spread. Outbreaks hurt everyone by harming the economy, causing lockdowns and restrictions, interfering with travel, etc. Bad argument #20: They said we\u2019d only need two doses, but now it\u2019s three Reality: So what? Why is that a problem? Bad argument #21: But science has been wrong before Reality: This is a misunderstanding of how science works Science is inherently the process of discrediting previous ideas, but in the modern era, previous ideas generally turn out to be incomplete more than entirely wrong, particularly for topics like vaccines where the evidence for their safety and effectiveness of vaccinees is overwhelming (see #10, 13\u201316). Further, the fact that scientific conclusions have been wrong before absolutely does not mean that you can blindly assume that the current evidence is wrong. If it did, you could reject any scientific result you like on the basis that science has been wrong before. You have to present actual evidence that the current conclusions are wrong, and there is simply no evidence that we are wrong about these vaccines. Details here and here. Also, see posts here, here, and here regarding the nature of a scientific consensus. See this post regarding the claim that most scientific studies are wrong. Bad argument #22: They laughed at Galileo and Columbus Reality: This is a misconception and doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re right Galileo was mostly criticized by the church (i.e., people who were ignoring evidence because of ideology) not his fellow scientists. Also, critically, he had actual evidence, not conjecture, conspiracy theories, or a blind denial of evidence. Columbus, on the other hand was painfully wrong about the size of the earth (everyone already knew it was round) and just got lucky that there was another continent that Europeans didn\u2019t know about. Finally, again, you must have actual evidence that current conclusions are wrong (see #21). Details here and here and here. Bad argument #23: There used to be a consensus that smoking was safe Reality: No there wasn\u2019t This is a complete myth. Scientists have known since WWII that smoking was dangerous (Proctor 2012). Tobacco companies never managed to buy off more than a handful of doctors and scientists. What they had was a good PR team, not a scientific consensus (also see #21 and 22). See posts here, here, and here regarding the nature of a scientific consensus. See this post regarding the claim that most scientific studies are wrong. Bad argument #24: I just don\u2019t trust pharmaceutical companies\/It\u2019s all about money Reality: It\u2019s about trusting science, not \u201cbig pharma\u201d I don\u2019t trust \u201cbig pharma\u201d either, and I\u2019m all for tight regulations and oversight, removing lobbyist, making drugs affordable, etc. I do, however, trust the science, a very large portion of which has been conducted by independent scientists who are not funded by pharmaceutical companies. The thing about science is that it is self-correcting. If pharmaceutical companies faked their data, other scientists would find out and report it. Keep in mind also that there are multiple competing pharmaceutical companies who would love to discredit each other See posts here and here for more on the \u201cfollow the money\u201d argument. Bad argument #25: [insert personal anecdotes] Reality: Anecdotes are pretty meaningless in science The fact that event A happened before event B does not indicate (or even suggest) that event A caused event B (that\u2019s known as a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy). At best, anecdotes can suggest things to be studied, but to actually determine causation, safety, or efficacy we need large properly controlled studies, and those have shown that these vaccines are safe and effective (see #10, 13\u201316). Anecdotes simply are not reliable evidence of causation. Additionally, one specific anecdote I\u2019d like to deal with is the argument that, \u201cI got COVID and was fine; therefore, it\u2019s not dangerous.\u201d This is known as a survivorship bias: i.e., those who died are inherently not here to share their stories. The fact that you were fine does not alter the fact that millions weren\u2019t. Similarly, if you are unvaccinated, before you go around boasting that you have an incredible immune system because you haven\u2019t caught COVID, consider the fact that every single person who has caught COVID could have bragged about not catching COVID until the moment they caught it. In other words, contemplate the possibility that you simply haven\u2019t caught it yet. More details here and here and here. Bad argument #26: There are tens of thousands of vaccine injuries and deaths on VAERS Reality: Being reported in VAERS does not mean that the vaccine caused the problem VAERS is a self-reported database that often contains all manner of absurdities. It is meant as an early warning system, and you have to be very, very careful when using it. The fact that something was reported in VAERS absolutely does not mean that the vaccine caused it. VAERS itself is explicit about that (see screenshot below [bold was in the original]; also see #25). More details here Bad argument #27: But there are real risks from the vaccines Reality: Yes, but they are rare, and the benefits outweigh the risks Adverse events exist for all real medications. For vaccines, however, serious side effects are very rare, and the benefits from the vaccines far outweigh the risks from the disease. Risk assessment is an exercise in probabilities, and for almost any medicine, there will be some small subset who end up worse off because of it, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that your risk (i.e., your probability of injury) is lower with the vaccines than without them. As a result, vaccines save millions of lives, with COVID vaccines already having saved hundreds of thousands of lives (Mesle et al. 2021). See studies cited in #10, 13\u201316 Bad argument #28: Various conspiracy theories\/FDA corruption Reality: Science is about evidence, not conjecture and conspiracy theories Conspiracy theories are endless, but they all suffer the same fundamental problems of not having any credible evidence and stating assumptions as if they are facts. No actual evidence has been presented to show that data were faked, FDA officials were bought off to push the vaccines, etc. Further, this argument ignores the facts that there are countries other than the USA and health\/regulatory agencies from around the world are in widespread agreement about the safety and effectiveness of these vaccines. The research is being conducted by tens of thousands of researchers from hundreds of universities, companies, and agencies from around the world. Faking these data would require a truly insane conspiracy in which virtually all of the world\u2019s scientists, health agencies, governments, and major pharmaceutical companies agreed to work together to lie and endanger the public. If that level of agreement among rival nations and countries sounds absurd, that\u2019s because it is absurd. Bad argument #29: It\u2019s my choice\/freedom. We shouldn\u2019t have vaccine mandates Reality: You don\u2019t have the right to endanger others or ignore public health This is a political argument, not a scientific argument, but I will briefly make three points. First, a large portion of the people I see making this argument also use the other arguments in this post, suggesting that they are letting political views override facts. Second, personal freedoms always end as soon as they endanger someone else, and refusing to vaccinate does endanger others (see #16, 19). This is why you have the freedom to drive a car, but not the freedom to drive recklessly or while drunk. Third, at least in most countries, the mandates simply place restrictions on the unvaccinated (e.g., requiring vaccination for a workplace), which is not the same thing as \u201cforcing\u201d someone (e.g., the government doesn\u2019t \u201cforce\u201d you to be sober, it simply restricts your right to drive unless you are sober; even so, you aren\u2019t being \u201cforced\u201d to vaccinate, your ability to work certain jobs is simply being restricted to protect your coworkers). Bad argument #:30 But I heard on Youtube, Facebook, Joe Rogan, Fox, OAN, some random guy with cool sunglasses sitting in a pickup truck, etc\u2026 Reality: Those are not good sources Please just stop. Stop with the deluded belief that you know more than the experts. Stop listening to unqualified people. Stop cherry-picking your experts. Multiple massive studies have clearly showed that COVID is dangerous and the vaccines are safe, effective, and help protect you and those around you. Either you accept that evidence or you deny it.

        "link":"https:\/\/thelogicofscience.com\/2021\/07\/27\/the-99-survive-covid-argument-is-deceptive-and-completely-misses-the-point\/",
        "text":"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the argument that \u201c99% of COVID patients survive\u201d has been repeatedly used as an excuse to oppose public health measures including mask mandates, lockdowns, and, more recently, vaccines. It asserts that because COVID has a ~99% survivorship, is not really that big of a concern and vaccines, masks, lockdowns, etc. are not needed. There are many issues with this argument, but before I talk specifically about COVID-19, I want to discuss a hypothetical disease. Imagine that the majority of people who become infected with this hypothetical disease are fine. Roughly 70% of people are asymptomatic. Really serious consequences that could alter the rest of the victim\u2019s life only occur in about 0.5% of cases, and over 99.5% of patients make a full recovery. Actual mortality is even lower. The exact number varies, but even on the high end, over 99.9% people survive. Now, when I present this hypothetical disease like that, it probably doesn\u2019t sound that bad. Simply giving you those numbers without any additional context makes the disease sound pretty benign, and you might be tempted to use this \u201c>99% live\u201d argument and argue that we don\u2019t really need a massive vaccine push and should just wait for natural herd immunity. Here\u2019s the thing though. I lied when I said this was a hypothetical disease. Those are the stats for polio (CDC Pinkbook), a notoriously horrible disease that was once a scourge on our planet causing thousands of cases of paralysis and even death. It is a disease that, thanks to vaccines, we very rightly sent into oblivion in nearly every part of the world. If, however, instead of using vaccines, we had listened to this \u201c99% live\u201d argument, we would still have polio in countries like the USA, and children would still be getting infected, paralyzed, and even killed by this disease. Ninety-nine percent survival is not as high as it sounds, nor is it the only factor that has to be considered, but it can sound very persuasive when it is presented without the other necessary pieces of information. Please, keep this in mind as we now turn our attention to COVID. If you are tempted to dismiss the severity of COVID or the necessity of vaccines because COVID \u201conly\u201d kills 1% of patients, keep in mind that polio \u201conly\u201d paralyzed 0.5% of its victims and killed less than 0.1%. Note: The actual COVID case fatality rate is affected by many factors (e.g., age). As such, it is far more complicated than a simple \u201c99%,\u201d and you should not confuse that number with the notion that you personally have a 99% chance of survival. Nevertheless, 99% is the number I keep seeing people use, and it is a rough approximation of an average for many parts of the world, so for simplicity, I will continue using it here. Infection prevalence matters One of the key problems with the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it completely ignores the importance of transmissibility and infection prevalence (i.e., how easily a disease can spread). You see, a disease can be a serious threat to a population (in terms of mortality) either by having a high case fatality rate (i.e., killing a large percentage of patients) or by being highly contagious (i.e., infecting a large number of people), and case fatality rates can be very misleading by themselves. Consider, for example, two hypothetical diseases (A and B). A has an extremely high case fatality rate of 100%, but it is not very contagious and has a very low prevalence in the population. Only about 1 in 1 million people will catch it. In contrast, disease B has a much lower case fatality rate (1%), but is extremely contagious, and about 1 in 10 people will catch it. This means that in a population of 10 million people, disease A will kill 10 people, whereas disease B will kill 10 thousand people! So, which of those diseases should you be more concerned about? Obviously disease B is more concerning, right? You are at a higher risk of dying form disease B, even though 99% of patients survive. Why? Because it is so common. If you admit this basic fact, that disease B would be more concerning than disease A, then you have just admitted that case fatality rate is not sufficient in and of itself to tell you how concerning a disease is. If we had relied only on case fatalities, we would have incorrectly concluded that disease A was the bigger risk. This clearly demonstrates that the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is not a good argument, because we have to look at other factors besides just survivorship (the opposite of case fatalities), and even a disease with a 99% survival rate can be very dangerous to both populations at large and you personally if it is highly contagious. To put it simply, when considering risk, you need to consider both how likely you are to be infected, and how likely you are to die (or suffer serious consequences) if you are infected. In the case of COVID19, a large part of why it is so dangerous is its high rate of transmission, with new variants like the Delta strain making the situation even worse. That is why it has been able to kill over 4 million people world-wide, with over 600,000 deaths in the US alone. Those are sobering numbers, which should really make you stop and think long and hard about the veracity of the \u201c99% survival\u201d argument. To me, it seems self-evident that a disease that has already killed over 600,000 people in the US alone is a serious problem that merits something like a massive vaccination campaign, and the argument that the disease is not dangerous\/doesn\u2019t merit vaccines is clearly flawed. Indeed, in 2020, COVID was the 3rd leading cause of death in the USA, behind only cancer and heart disease (Ahmad and Anderson 2021), and in early 2021, it spiked to the #1 cause of death in the US (a situation that is no longer the case thanks in part to vaccines). That\u2019s what COVID looks like when it is not controlled by measures like vaccines, and it should be abundantly apparent from that situation that simply having a 99% survival rate does not mean that a disease isn\u2019t a serious threat. Indeed, if you are going to argue that we don\u2019t need to be that worried about COVID 19, then you had better make that same argument about literally every other cause of death, because when allowed to spread, COVID kills more than any of them (or if you want to arbitrarily restrict yourself to the 2020 data, you\u2019d better make that argument about every cause of death other than cancer and heart disease). To put all of that another way, a 99% survival rate is only comforting if the spread of the disease is being controlled by something like vaccines. A 99% survival rate without vaccines still results in hundreds of thousands of people dying. That is a simple fact. Natural herd immunity is a misnomer Proponents of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument often say that we will eventually achieve natural herd immunity, at which point people will be protected even without vaccines. Let me briefly explain why that is a terrible idea. The term \u201cherd immunity\u201d really only makes sense within the context of vaccines. Vaccine-induced herd immunity = a population that is protected from a disease. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d = a survivorship bias in which the survivors of the outbreak are protected from future infection and many previous herd members died. \u201cNatural herd immunity\u201d is a bloodbath. It\u2019s a nonsense term. Estimates for what it would take to achieve herd immunity to COVID vary, but even at the (probably) unrealistically low end of 60% immune, getting there in the US without vaccines would involve the deaths of roughly 2 million Americans! At what is probably the more realistic threshold of 90% immune, without vaccines, we are looking at about ~3 million dead Americans. That\u2019s not herd immunity; that\u2019s herd culling. Alternatively, we can achieve actual herd immunity with vaccines without killing 2\u20133 million people. Disease risk is more than just death One of the many deceptive aspects of the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument is that it acts as if COVID infection is a strictly binary situation: either you die or you are totally fine. That is, however, a completely false dichotomy. Since when is death the only outcome we care about? Many people who catch COVID live, but still undergo tremendous suffering physically, mentally, and financially. When we are considering the risks and benefits of something like a vaccine for COVID, we should not just look at whether or not you are likely to die. Things like time off work and physical suffering matter. There is a vast spectrum of responses from \u201ctotally fine\u201d to \u201calive, but extreme suffering (and in the US, often financial difficulty).\u201d Good estimates of hospitalization rates are a bit hard to come by, and are usually expressed in terms of rate per population size, not rate per infection, but by taking the cumulative overall hospitalization rate per 100,000 people from the CDC, the US population size, and the cumulative cases in the US, we find that roughly 5% of COVID cases result in hospitalizations. A scientific study using more sophisticated methods provides a similar estimate of 4.5% (Reese et al. 2020) [note: as with the case fatality rate, these are crude rates for the whole population and actual rates vary by age group]. Indeed, COVID is so rampant, that roughly 0.5% of the entire US population has been hospitalized for it. That\u2019s actually an incredible number. One out of every 200 people in America has been hospitalized for COVID (again if we average across the population), and that\u2019s just actual hospitalizations, many more have been at home sick, took time off work, etc. Further, the complications from the disease can be serious. COVID can set off a cytokine storm that affects multiple of your body\u2019s major systems. It\u2019s too early to know exactly what that means long-term, but based on what we know about COVID and other viral diseases, there is good reason to be concerned that many people who survive will have long-term lung and heart issues (Mitrani et al. 2020; Fraser 2020). To be clear, we need to wait for more data before knowing for sure if there will be long-term complications, but the reasonably high probability that there will be is certainly something to think about when considering the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and it\u2019s something that is completely ignored by this unreasonably simplistic \u201c99% survive\u201d argument. Vaccines: benefits outweigh the risks Finally, let\u2019s briefly turn our attention to the COVID vaccines. This would take many posts to cover in proper detail, so I\u2019ll try to be brief and just hit the key points. All vaccines have side effects, but serious side effects are rare, and your risk of a getting COVID and having a serious complication from it is much higher than your risk of a serious complication from vaccines. Countries with large vaccination programs (e.g., Israel; Rossman et al. 2020) are seeing massive drops in COVID infection, hospitalization, and death rates thanks to vaccines, and there has not been a comparable increase in injuries, hospitalizations, and deaths from vaccines. In other words, the vaccines are reducing risk. In the USA, an analysis of data in May (by which time roughly 40% of the country had received both doses of the vaccine and 50% had at least one dose) found that out of over 107,000 COVID hospitalizations, fewer than 1,200 were for vaccinated individuals, and out of 18,000 COVID deaths, only ~150 of them were for vaccinated individuals. In other words, over 99% of COVID deaths were from unvaccinated individuals, as were nearly 99% of COVID hospitalizations. That trend has continued, and now with over half the country fully vaccinated, officials like Dr. Fauci are likewise reporting that over 99% of COVID deaths and over 97% of COVID hospitalizations are from the unvaccinated. The vaccines clearly work. Further, we have not seen hospitalization or mortality rates from vaccine side effects rising to meet those numbers. In other words, with roughly half the population vaccinated, if the vaccine was truly more dangerous than the disease, we should see vaccine deaths and serious injuries at a rate that exceeds the rate for COVID. So where are the >18,000 individuals in May who died from the vaccine? Where are the >100,000 hospitalizations from the vaccine? They don\u2019t exist, because serious side effects are extremely rare. This clearly shows that your total risk is lower with the vaccine than without it. These numbers make that undeniable. Yes, the disease has a ~99% survival, and yes, the vaccine does have side effects, but the disease is exceptionally common, and series side effects of the vaccine are exceptionally rare, which, when taken together, results in your risk of serious injury or death being substantially lower when you have the vaccine. Just to really drive this home, let\u2019s look specifically at myocarditis following the mRNA vaccines. It is still not entirely clear if this is actually a side effect of the vaccines, but there is growing evidence that it is causal. Exact rates vary, but every calculation shows them to be low (Shay et al. 2021). A large data set from Israel reported a mere 148 cases within 30 days of vaccination out of over 5 million people who were vaccinated (Israel Ministry of Health). Even if all of those were caused by the vaccine, that would be a rate of 0.003%! Further, 95% of those cases were mild. In the USA, with over 150 million people vaccinated, using data from VAERS (much of which has not been verified), the WHO calculated the following myocarditis rates per fully vaccinated individual: 0.041% for males aged 12\u201329, 0.004% for females aged 12\u201329, and 0.002% for males and females over 29. Further, again, most of those cases were mild and did not require serious medical intervention. I have not so far seen any confirmed deaths from this. In contrast, COVID has a case fatality rate of ~1%. Now, I hear you saying, \u201cbut I am a male under 30, which means I\u2019m at a low risk of death from COVID and higher risk of myocarditis, so for me the risk outweighs the benefit,\u201d however, that math still doesn\u2019t work. From the start of the outbreak in the US (based on the current CDC data), there have been 2,462 deaths from COVID in males under 30, and 1,594 deaths in females under 30. There is no evidence to suggest that the vaccines are causing comparable carnage. Scientists actually ran the numbers on this and calculated that for males under 30, every 1 million second doses of an mRNA vaccine will result in 39\u201347 cases of myocarditis, but will prevent 11,000 COVID cases, 560 hospitalizations, 138 ICU admissions, and 6 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021). Also, remember again that most of these myocarditis cases are mild, whereas for COVID, even just the expected number of ICU admissions is 3 times the number of mostly mild myocarditis cases! Further, that is for a group with a relatively low COVID risk and relatively high myocarditis risk. The benefits of the vaccine are even more exaggerated for other groups. In men over 29, for example, 1 million second doses will only result in 3\u20134 cases of myocarditis, and will prevent 15,300 COVID cases, 4,598 hospitalizations, 1,242 ICU admissions, and 700 deaths (Gargano et al. 2021)! Also, notice how those who like to cast aspersions on vaccines try to downplay death from COVID while hyping mostly mild injury from the vaccine. Indeed, this \u201c99% survive\u201d argument would have us believe that a 1% fatality is too low to be seriously concerned, but a 0.002\u20130.041% rate of generally mild myocarditis is unacceptably high. It is crazy to think that 3\u20134 mostly mild cases of myocarditis is worse than 700 deaths! That\u2019s simply not how math works. The numbers are undeniable: your personal risk* is lower with the vaccine than without the vaccine, even though \u201c99% of people survive.\u201d I\u2019ve been focusing on the concerns around Pfizer and Moderna because those are the prominent vaccines where most of my readers are, but we can do the same sorts of calculations with any of the vaccines currently available. They all have various risks, but in every case, the risks associate with not getting the vaccine outweigh the risks associated with getting it. *Obviously some people have pre-existing conditions that make vaccines dangerous for them. That is not what I am talking about here. I am addressing people who have no known health conditions that would prevent them from getting the vaccine. Conclusion In summary, the \u201c99% survive\u201d argument completely ignores the high prevalence of COVID and completely ignores the importance of non-lethal effects (including hospitalization, possibly long-term effects, time off work, etc.). Further, using this argument against the necessity for vaccines massively and inappropriately downplays the risk from COVID while exaggerating the risks from vaccines. The empirical reality is that COVID is very dangerous, with over 600,000 dead in the US alone, whereas the vaccines are very safe. Given that over 50% of the US population is currently vaccinated, if the vaccines were truly more dangerous than the risk from getting COVID, we\u2019d expect the rates of vaccine deaths and serious injuries to be surpassing the rates of deaths and serious injuries from COVID. In reality we are, of course, not seeing anything even remotely like that. Deaths and serious injury from COVID remain common in the unvaccinated, whereas serious injuries from the vaccines are extremely rare and deaths virtually unheard of. I think part of the problem is that we often view taking an action as the inherently riskier choice. After all, you can\u2019t get myocarditis from the vaccine if you never get the vaccine. That reasoning, while understandable, ignores the fact that not getting the vaccine is also an action, and that action puts you at a much greater risk of death or serious illness. Indeed, that risk from COVID is so great, and the risk from vaccines is so small, that even if you are young and healthy, the risk associated with not getting the vaccine is far higher than the risk associated with getting the vaccine. This is a mathematical fact. Please read this post before making an argument about \u201cunknown long-term effects\u201d from vaccines. Related Posts Literature Cited Advertisement",

        "text":"NIH-funded pediatric COVID-19 testing study finds school-aged children can self-swab Child-collected nasal swab samples on par with swabs collected by health care workers. Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta A new study that could have immediate implications for COVID-19 testing in schools found that with age-appropriate instructions, school-aged children can successfully use a nasal swab to obtain their own COVID-19 test specimen. The study provides data to support recommendations regarding self-swabbing that can be implemented by schools and in other settings where children undergo COVID-19 testing. The study was led by a team of clinical researchers at Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, and Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta and funded by the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx\u00ae) Tech program. \u201cHaving adults collect swab samples from kids is not a trivial matter in schools and other group settings,\u201d said Bruce Tromberg, Ph.D., director of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and lead for RADx Tech. \u201cThe study data may surprise some and will reassure others that children as young as 4 years old can follow simply presented instructions and collect their own nasal specimen for COVID-19 testing.\u201d The team conducted their study in July and August 2021 at sites in the Atlanta area, enrolling 197 children with symptoms of COVID-19. Prior to self-swabbing, they showed the children a short (90-second) how-to video designed for a young audience and provided a handout with written instructions and pictures. The children then proceeded to swab their noses\u2014four rotations of the swab against the inside of each nostril approximately one centimeter deep. Next, the health care worker used a second swab to collect a sample by swabbing each nostril of the individual children. All samples were then submitted to a clinical laboratory for PCR analysis. The self-collected swabs and those collected by a health care worker agreed 97.8% of the time for a positive result and 98.1% of the time for a negative result. The analysis showed that both collection methods identified the 44% of symptomatic kids who were positive for COVID-19. \u201cSeeing how closely the results line up between the children and trained health care workers is a strong indicator that these age groups are fully capable of swabbing themselves if given proper instruction,\u201d says Jesse Waggoner, MD, an assistant professor of Infectious Diseases with the Emory University School of Medicine and one of the lead authors on the study. A higher percentage of children 8 and under needed assistance, such as more instruction before correctly completing self-collection\u201421.8% compared to 6.1% for children older than 8\u2014but SARS-CoV-2 detection among the two age groups did not differ. The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, offers data that are available to COVID-19 test manufacturers when submitting applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for diagnostics emergency use authorization (EUA). The NIH-supported RADx Tech Testing Verification Core provided the data late last year, where it subsequently has been referenced by manufacturers in support of EUA for their COVID-19 PCR diagnostic tests. Prior to this study, the FDA had not authorized COVID-19 tests with self-swabbing by children under age 14. Several co-authors from the FDA were advisors on the study design and this study is one example of the unprecedented collaboration between the NIH and FDA during the pandemic. \u201cPediatric self-swabbing will support expanded testing access and should make it even easier to test school age populations with fewer resources,\u201d said Tim Stenzel, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics at FDA. \u201cThis study furthers our knowledge of test accuracy with these types of samples and provides test manufacturers with data to support their EUA requests to the FDA.\u201d Longstanding medical practice has been to have a health care worker collect samples for respiratory tract infection testing. However, that scenario is challenging when repeat testing of children is required in school or in other group settings that are less likely to have trained health care workers available to collect samples. Student self-swabbing\u2014even when samples are sent off-site for analysis\u2014could reduce the onus on school staff. The self-swabbing study evolved out of discussions among researchers at the RADx Tech Testing Verification Core in Atlanta with the NIH RADx Tech program and at the FDA about gaining data to understand at what age children can perform self-swabbing. \u201cEvery minute of a health care worker\u2019s time is at a premium,\u201d said senior author Wilbur Lam, M.D., pediatric hematologist and oncologist at Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta, professor at the Emory University School of Medicine Department of Pediatrics and at the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University, and Program Director of the Georgia Clinical and Translational Science Awards Program Hub Innovation Catalyst Program. \u201cWhy not allow a kid to self-swab? It\u2019s a win-win! They would rather do it themselves and it frees up the health care worker to do other things.\u201d He added that while the study paves the way for lab-based test developers to add self-collection by 4 to 14-year-old children, end-users should follow a given device\u2019s instructions for use.

        "text":"As omicron subvariant BA.5 continues to drive the coronavirus\u2019 spread in the United States, I\u2019ve been thinking about what could come next. Omicron and its offshoots have been topping the variant charts since last winter. Before that, delta reigned. Scientists have a few ideas for how new variants emerge. One involves people with persistent infections \u2014 people who test positive for the virus over a prolonged period of time. I\u2019m going to tell you about the curious case of a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 for at least 471 days and what can happen when infections roil away uncontrolled.

That lengthy infection first came onto epidemiologist Nathan Grubaugh\u2019s radar in the summer of 2021. His team had been analyzing coronavirus strains in patient samples from Yale New Haven Hospital when Grubaugh spotted something he had seen before. Known only as B.1.517, this version of the virus never got a name like delta or omicron, nor rampaged through communities quite like its infamous relatives. Instead, after springing up somewhere in North America in early 2020, B.1.517 tooled around in a handful of regions around the world, even sparking an outbreak in Australia. But after April 2021, B.1.517 seemed to sputter, one of the who-knows-how-many viral lineages that flare up and then eventually fizzle. B.1.517 might have been long forgotten, shouldered aside by the latest variant to stake a claim in local communities. \u201cAnd yet we were still seeing it,\u201d Grubaugh says. Even after B.1.517 had petered out across the country, his team noticed it cropping up in patient samples. The same lineage, every few weeks, like clockwork, for months. One clue was the samples\u2019 specimen ID. The code on the B.1.517 samples was always the same, Grubaugh\u2019s team noticed. They had all come from a single patient. That patient, a person in their 60s with a history of cancer, relapsed in November of 2020. That was right around when they first tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. After seeing B.1.517 show up again and again in their samples, Grubaugh worked with a clinician to get the patient\u2019s permission to analyze their data. \ud83e\uddf5for our latest preprint on the intrahost evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus in an immunocompromised individual (60s) with a history of cancer chronically infected for at least 471 days (ongoing) with consistently replicating viruses at a high viral load. 1\/nhttps:\/\/t.co\/qBNEjXTqMt \u2014 Chrispin Chaguza (@ChrispinChaguza) July 3, 2022 Ultimately, the patient has remained infected for 471 days (and counting), Grubaugh, Yale postdoctoral researcher Chrispin Chaguza and their team reported last month in a preliminary study posted at medRxiv.org. Because of deteriorating health and a desire to maintain their anonymity, the patient was not willing to be interviewed, and Grubaugh has no direct contact with them. But all those samples collected over all those days told an incredible tale of viral evolution. Over about 15 months, at least three genetically distinct versions of the virus had rapidly evolved inside the patient, the team\u2019s analyses suggested. Each version had dozens of mutations and seemed to coexist in the patient\u2019s body. \u201cHonestly, if any one of these were to emerge in a population and begin transmitting, we would be calling it a new variant,\u201d Grubaugh says. That scenario is probably rare, he says. After all, lots of prolonged infections have likely occurred during the pandemic, and only a handful of concerning variants have emerged. But the work does suggest that persistent viral infections can provide a playground for speedy evolutionary experimentation \u2014 perhaps taking advantage of weakened immune systems. Grubaugh\u2019s work is \u201cprobably the most detailed look we\u2019ve had at a single, persistent infection with SARS-CoV-2 so far,\u201d says Tom Friedrich, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, who was not involved with the work. The study supports an earlier finding about a different immunocompromised patient \u2014 one with a persistent omicron infection. In that work, researchers documented the evolution of the virus over 12 weeks and showed that its descendant infected at least five other people. Together, the studies lay out how such infections could potentially drive the emergence of the next omicron. \u201cI am pretty well convinced that people with persistent infection are important sources of new variants,\u201d Friedrich says. Who exactly develops these infections remains mysterious. Yes, the virus can pummel people with weakened immune systems, but \u201cnot every immunocompromised person develops a persistent infection,\u201d says Viviana Simon, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who worked on the omicron infection study. In fact, doctors and scientists have no idea how common these infections are. \u201cWe just don\u2019t really have the numbers,\u201d Simon says. That\u2019s a huge gap for researchers, and something Mount Sinai\u2019s Pathogen Surveillance Program is trying to address by analyzing real-time infection data. Studying patients with prolonged infections could also tell scientists where SARS-CoV-2 evolution is heading, Friedrich says. Just because the virus evolves within a person doesn\u2019t mean it will spread to other people. But if certain viral mutations tend to arise in multiple people with persistent infections, that could hint that the next big variant might evolve in a similar way. Knowing more about these mutation patterns could help researchers forecast what\u2019s to come, an important step in designing future coronavirus vaccine boosters. Beyond viral forecasting, Grubaugh says identifying people with prolonged infections is important so doctors can provide care. \u201cWe need to give them access to vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs,\u201d he says. Those treatments could help patients clear their infections. But identifying persistent infections is easier said than done, he points out. Many places in the world aren\u2019t set up to spot these infections and don\u2019t have access to vaccines or treatments. And even when these are available, some patients opt out. The patient in Grubaugh\u2019s study received a monoclonal antibody infusion about 100 days into their infection, then refused all other treatments. They have not been vaccinated. Though the patient remained infectious over the course of the study, their variants never spread to the community, as far as Grubaugh knows. And while untreated chronic infections might spawn new variants, they could emerge in other ways, too, like from animals infected with the virus, from person-to-person transmission in groups of people scientists haven\u2019t been monitoring, or from \u201csomething else that maybe none of us has thought of yet,\u201d he says. \u201cSARS-CoV-2 has continued to surprise us with its evolution.\u201d",

        "text":"For millions of people, COVID-19 doesn\u2019t end with a negative test. Weeks or months after traces of the virus disappear from noses and throats, symptoms can persist or come back. New ones might pop up and stick around for months. People suffering from long COVID are unwillingly in it for the long haul \u2014 and it\u2019s still unclear who\u2019s at the highest risk for the condition. Researchers don\u2019t yet have an official definition for long COVID, and its symptoms are wide-ranging (SN: 7\/29\/22). Some people struggle with extreme fatigue that interferes with their daily lives. Others can\u2019t concentrate or struggle with memory amid thick brain fog. Still others have organ damage or a persistent cough and difficulty breathing.

Client key* E-mail Address* Sign up Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up. \u201cThere are a variety of different kinds of ways that people can have long COVID. It\u2019s not just the one thing,\u201d says Leora Horwitz, an internal medicine physician at New York University Langone Health. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes it so hard to study.\u201d This spectrum of symptoms makes pinning down who\u2019s at high risk for long-term health problems from the disease especially hard. Some post-COVID conditions may stem from virus-induced damage or from the stress of being hospitalized with severe disease. In other cases, the body\u2019s own immune response to the virus could drive the damage. Or the virus may be hiding somewhere in the body, possibly the gut, helping symptoms to persist (SN: 11\/24\/20). Different causes may have different risk groups, says Hannah Davis, cofounder of the Patient-Led Research Collaborative, a research and advocacy group studying long COVID. There are some broad hints about who\u2019s at risk. Studies suggest that women are more likely than men to have lingering symptoms. COVID-19 patients with more than five symptoms in the first week of infection or preexisting health conditions such as asthma may be more likely to develop long COVID. Age also appears to be a risk factor, though results are mixed regarding whether the burden falls on older people or middle-aged people. Populations that were disproportionally hit by COVID-19 overall \u2014 including Black and Hispanic people \u2014 may similarly face disparities for long COVID. And while vaccination seems to protect people from developing long COVID, Horwitz says, it\u2019s still unclear by how much. Age is a risk factor for severe COVID-19, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists more than 30 health problems, including cancer and lung disease, that also raise the risk. \u201cSo many researchers assume that those [risk factors] will be the same for long COVID and there\u2019s no scientific basis for that,\u201d Davis says. There are many more that researchers could be missing when it comes to long COVID. Using health records and exams, and knowledge of ailments with symptoms similar to long COVID, experts are on the hunt for those risk factors. Examining health When it comes to getting a better handle on who\u2019s at risk for long COVID \u2014 which also goes by the wonky alias Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection \u2014 electronic health records may hold important clues. Horwitz is part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health\u2019s RECOVER initiative that aims to understand the long-term impacts of COVID-19. One arm of the study involves mining millions of electronic health records to find potential patterns. Studying millions of these records should pinpoint potential risk factors that are rare in the population overall but perhaps more common for people with long COVID, Horwitz says. \u201cThat\u2019s hard even in a cohort study of thousands.\u201d But health records aren\u2019t perfect: They depend on physicians logging that patients are having trouble sleeping or focusing, or that they\u2019re exhausted. \u201cThe things people are complaining about, we\u2019re really bad at writing down those diagnoses on the record,\u201d Horwitz says. \u201cSo we miss that.\u201d To account for health records\u2019 deficiencies, Horwitz and colleagues are also directly studying thousands of people. Participants answer a questionnaire every three months so that the team can identify what kinds of symptoms people have and whether they\u2019re getting better or worse. Then blood, urine, stool and saliva samples can reveal what\u2019s happening in the body. Tests on those samples can uncover if the coronavirus is still around and causing trouble, or if the immune system has learned to attack the body itself. Participants with abnormal test results will undergo additional, targeted testing. \u201cUnlike electronic health records where it\u2019s hit or miss, like somebody might have had a CAT scan or might not, here we say, \u2018OK, you have trouble breathing. We will take a look at your lungs,\u2019\u201d Horwitz says. The study includes a range of participants: adults and kids, pregnant people, those currently with COVID-19 and people who died after having the disease. Some of the potential risk factors that the team is looking for include autoimmune diseases and other viral infections. The list may grow as more people join the study. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to balance the fishing versus making sure that we\u2019re at least fishing for things that could be in the water,\u201d Horwitz says. Among short supply, though, are people who never caught the virus \u2014 important \u201ccontrols\u201d to highlight what\u2019s different about people who got COVID-19. So far, more than 7,000 people have signed up, and the group plans to recruit around 10,000 more. It\u2019s a lot of data, but early results may soon start coming in. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably try to do an interim peek at those data this fall,\u201d Horwitz says. \u201cIt\u2019s tricky because we deliberately wanted to enroll 18,000 people so we would have enough power to really look at the things we care about. I don\u2019t want to cheat and look too early, but we also know that there\u2019s a lot of interest.\u201d Striking similarities Some long COVID symptoms \u2014 brain fog, fatigue and trouble sleeping \u2014 mirror another illness: myalgic encephalomyelitis\/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME\/CFS. Other long COVID symptoms, such as rapid heartbeat and dizziness, fall in the category of nervous system disorders called dysautonomia. Similar symptoms could belie similar risk factors. Yet potential risk factors for those conditions are largely missing from long COVID research, says Davis, who has had long COVID since March 2020. Among the possibilities that scientists are considering are things like Epstein-Barr virus, migraines and some autoimmune diseases. Epstein-Barr virus could be a big one, Davis says. Infections last a lifetime because the virus can go into hiding in the body and possibly reemerge. That virus has been linked to ME\/CFS for decades, though its role in the disease remains unclear, Davis says. Researchers are exploring whether Epstein-Barr virus infections (shown in this transmission electron microscope image) may be linked to long COVID. Dr. Fred Murphy\/CDC Some early hints of a link between Epstein-Barr virus and long COVID already exist. Multiple studies have found evidence in blood samples from some long COVID patients that the immune system recently battled with Epstein-Barr virus, which can cause infectious mononucleosis, a disease characterized by extreme fatigue. Other studies have found signs of the virus itself. And in 2021, Davis and colleagues found that 40 out of 580 people with symptoms of long COVID who responded to an online survey reported having a current or recent Epstein-Barr virus infection. With ME\/CFS, it\u2019s possible that another illness caused by a different virus triggers the Epstein-Barr virus, which then causes the fatigue syndrome. Given the parallels between that condition and long COVID, some scientists are wondering if the two are actually the same disease, with the coronavirus now known as one trigger. Examining health conditions that raise the chances of long COVID could provide answers for both diseases, says Nancy Klimas, an immunologist at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. That\u2019s in part because researchers can more easily identify people who developed lingering symptoms after a bout of COVID-19 compared with unknown infections that may precede ME\/CFS. Also, \u201cthere\u2019s a huge difference in these two fields and it\u2019s money,\u201d Klimas says. She now has funding from the CDC to compare long COVID patients with people who have ME\/CFS. The team hopes that physical exams and specialized tests will reveal whether the two diseases are indeed the same and be a step toward understanding the mechanisms behind the lingering symptoms. Still, since long COVID as a whole encompasses such a wide range of symptoms, it will take time to uncover who is at risk of what. If COVID-19 were just one disease impacting the lungs, heart or brain, the research might be easier, Horwitz says. \u201cBut we have to test everything.\u201d",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.sciencenews.org\/article\/covid-rebound-infection-paxlovid-biden-fauci",
        "text":"For some people, including President Joe Biden and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci, the relief of vanishing COVID-19 symptoms and a negative test is fleeting. Biden, Fauci and many others have seen their tests turn positive again or have unwelcome symptoms return after taking a five-day course of the antiviral Paxlovid. Other people, including my husband, have had their infections rebound even without taking the drug. Multiple studies have described cases of \u201cPaxlovid rebound\u201d after treatment. In one, seven Paxlovid-treated patients had the virus rebound to high levels after treatment ended, and symptoms returned for six of them, virologist Jonathan Li and colleagues reported in June in Clinical Infectious Diseases. Samples from three patients even carried infectious virus, a clue that some people who rebound might infect others. Another study that has yet to be peer-reviewed by other researchers found that fewer than 6 percent of people in the study who\u2019d been prescribed Paxlovid had rebound infections in the month after finishing treatment. Science News headlines, in your inbox Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your email inbox every Thursday. Client key* E-mail Address* Sign up Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up. It\u2019s unclear why Paxlovid rebound happens, says Li, of Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Studies show that people given the drug still develop a strong immune response to the virus after five days of treatment. \u201cI think what\u2019s happening in that situation is that you\u2019ve got virus replication that\u2019s been inhibited. All of a sudden, the drug has disappeared and the virus has a momentary opportunity to replicate. And it replicates to high levels,\u201d Li says. But by then, the immune system has learned to fend off the coronavirus. If the recently trained immune cells encounter newly made viruses and set off alarm bells, symptoms may briefly come back. Some people might not want to take the drug because they\u2019re worried about rebound, Li says. But Paxlovid itself probably isn\u2019t the cause. The drug\u2019s not failing. It is still highly effective in preventing severe disease. \u201cI would not hesitate to give my patients Paxlovid,\u201d Li says. \u201cI do tell them to be on the lookout for rebounding symptoms. But it doesn\u2019t dissuade me in terms of prescribing it.\u201d Fauci took another course of Paxlovid in the wake of his rebound. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that there\u2019s no evidence that 10 days of treatment is any more effective than five days, or that patients need a repeat. But, researchers are testing whether taking the drug for a longer period of time might prevent rebound. Rebounding COVID-19 isn\u2019t limited to patients who take Paxlovid. Li recalls that even in the early days of the pandemic, some patients would come to him in the hospital saying that they\u2019d started to feel better but got worse again. It\u2019s hard to know how to interpret such anecdotal reports, he says. Researchers are still learning what an untreated viral infection can look like in the body. While the virus\u2019s (hopefully) brief invasion may appear straightforward on average \u2014 with virus levels in the body increasing to a peak before slowly declining as the person recovers \u2014 not everyone follows that pattern. My husband got COVID-19 two months ago. His symptoms lasted about a week, and he was delighted to see the line on his antigen test getting fainter. Even so, despite feeling perfectly healthy, the line was suddenly back at full strength almost immediately after he added his sample to a new test days later. He was frustrated and, as a social person, lamented having to stay isolated. Studies show he\u2019s not alone. When Li and colleagues studied the course of disease in COVID-19 clinical trial participants who received a placebo treatment, 1 in 8 people experienced a rebound, with symptoms coming back for 1 in 4 people. That rebound, however, typically lasted about a day, and few had both high viral loads and returning symptoms, the team reports in a preliminary study posted August 2 at medRxiv.org that hasn\u2019t yet been peer-reviewed by other scientists. In this case, there\u2019s no disappearing drug. Any returning symptoms without a positive test might be from something else such as allergies or a different respiratory virus, Li says. It\u2019s also possible that the virus is replicating in different parts of the body at different times. Some tests might end up negative when the body eliminates virus from the throat, for example, but it\u2019s still replicating at low levels in the nose. That latter scenario may have happened with my husband. In a confusing twist, he tested negative on two saliva PCR tests while continuing to test positive on nasal antigen tests. A PCR test is far more sensitive, so we expected the opposite to happen. Since experts say to consider a positive antigen test as a sign you\u2019re still contagious, he stayed isolated until he finally tested negative on an antigen test two weeks after his first symptoms appeared. Luckily, he\u2019s fully recovered now, and not at all eager for a repeat experience. That means we\u2019re both still masking in public spaces and taking other precautions. We know we\u2019re not done with this pandemic.",

        "text":"During a regional workshop in Argentina, the Director of PAHO called for countries to increase investment in epidemic and pandemic preparedness, because the question is not \u201cif there will be a new pandemic, but when\u201d. Buenos Aires, August 17, 2022 (PAHO)- With the aim of supporting countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to develop or update their operational plans to face future pandemics, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is holding a regional workshop on preparedness and response to events with pandemic and epidemic potential in Buenos Aires this week. This workshop will take into account the lessons learned from COVID-19. \"As we meet today, we continue to deal with the current COVID-19 pandemic and, at the same time, we are facing an outbreak of Monkeypox in several countries,\" said PAHO Director Carissa F. Etienne. COVID-19, she said, \"has been a formidable challenge\" and \"a stark reminder of the responsibility we all have to invest in prevention, preparedness and response to communicable pathogen events\u201d. Dr. Etienne highlighted that, as of last Wednesday, there were 170 million cases and nearly 3 million deaths due to COVID-19 in the Americas. She noted that other respiratory pathogens are re-emerging, and that seasonal influenza causes between 290,000 and 650,000 deaths each year in the region. \"We must never forget that it is not a question of whether a pandemic will occur due to a new influenza virus, but when it will occur,\" she warned. \"Our capacity to respond to health emergencies depends on what we have done before they occur and what we have learned during previous emergencies\" such as COVID-19, said the PAHO Director during the opening of the workshop, which brings together technical experts in epidemiology, laboratory, immunization and risk communication from the ministries of Health of Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay and Suriname. A preparedness and response plan for events with epidemic and pandemic potential is one of the core capacities required by the International Health Regulations (IHR), a legally binding international convention adopted by Member States of the World Health Organization (WHO) to prevent and respond to public health threats that can cross borders and affect populations around the world. \"Functioning health systems are the foundation of health security,\" asserted Dr. Etienne and it is essential to \"secure supply chains of vaccines, medicines, laboratory reagents, personal protective equipment and other strategic public health goods\" before the next emergency occurs, and \"strengthen the resilience of health systems with human resources and planning.\" The PAHO Director recalled that two centers in Argentina and Brazil were designated by WHO for the future development and production of vaccines using mRNA technology, something that is expected to improve timely and equitable access to vaccines in the region and contribute to health self-sufficiency. \"All of this is key for us to be prepared to respond and succeed during emergencies that threaten our region,\" she stressed. The Minister of Health of Argentina, Carla Vizzotti, considered that the COVID-19 pandemic showed that health \"must be a priority for everyone\" because \"without health one cannot study, work or produce\". After indicating that the government had to reformulate its response to the pandemic, Vizzotti said that the region must tackle the challenges around access to medical supplies -something learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, and \"think about how we can produce and expand access to vaccines.\u201d Reflecting on the countries' response to the emergency, Vizzotti stated that \"we were able to do many things in a very short time. We have to look back to see what we learned, but also forward in order to make improvements and take action that will better position us for the next pandemic\". \"The COVID-19 pandemic is not over yet,\" said the PAHO Representative in Argentina, Eva Jan\u00e9 Llopis, and added that since the declaration of the public health emergency of international importance on January 30, 2020, \"the response had to be adjusted, to seek funding and involve other sectors\" due to its great scope and duration. \"Reflecting on what we did, taking it to the level of strategies, and thinking about other epidemiological challenges is crucial to continue moving forward,\" she said. PAHO expects to hold similar workshops with other countries in the region during 2022. The outputs of this and other workshops will integrate the vision of the Americas region into global pandemic preparedness and response documents and guidelines.",

        "text":"August, 2022 Aaron Zea is 32 years old, a manager in the cultural sector, a cyclist who plays soccer every week and lives with HIV. \"For me living with HIV is very peaceful because I know that I can have a normal life, play sports and go to university. I\u2019m not going to die from this,\u201d said Aaron, speaking from his home in Medell\u00edn, Colombia. In nine years of living with the virus, he knows what he needs to do to stay healthy - \"look after my body, eat well, go to my check-ups and take my medications\". Today, treatment for HIV is effective and simple and generally consists of a single pill a day, with little to no adverse effects. However, this was not the case for people infected with HIV when Aaron was born in 1990, let alone in 1981, when the first cases of atypical pneumonia were diagnosed in gay men in San Francisco in the United States - something that would forever mark the lives of mankind. Aaron Zea leads a very active life and has been undetectable since starting antiretroviral treatment for HIV. New treatments have turned HIV infection into a chronic disease, and reduced mortality by 28% since 2010 in Latin America. However, this reduction remains below the global average due to huge advances in prevention, early detection, and the rapid initiation of treatment in Africa. Today, 2.5 million people in Latin America and the Caribbean are living with HIV. Every year, around 120,000 people acquire the virus and some 35,000 lose their lives from AIDS-related causes, such as tuberculosis, cryptococcal meningitis, histoplasmosis or toxoplasmosis. Since 2010, the number of new infections has increased by 5% in Latin America, with a partial reduction in the Caribbean. If a person who receives treatment manages to suppress the circulation of the virus in the blood, and does not transmit the infection, this is known as I = I or undetectable equals untransmissible, a powerful weapon of protection and prevention.",

        "title":"The Immune Signature of Long COVID",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.medpagetoday.com\/infectiousdisease\/longcovid\/100304",
        "text":"In this exclusive video, Harlan Krumholz, MD, director of the Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation at Yale University and Yale New Haven Hospital in Connecticut, discusses a recent preprint he co-authored on distinguishing long COVID through immune profiling. Krumholz, a cardiologist, is also the Harold H. Hines, Jr. Professor of Medicine and a professor in the Institute for Social and Policy Studies at Yale School of Medicine. The following is a transcript of his remarks: My name is Harlan Krumholz. I'm a professor of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine, and I'm here today to talk to you about a recent preprint that came out that describes some immunologic features of people with long COVID. Now, there have been many theories about what's causing long COVID. Some people think it's about viral persistence, some people think it's about autoimmunity, some people think it's about disruption of the microbiome, some think it's about reactivation of other viruses, some think it's tissue damage that initially started with the acute infection that persists, and some people just plain doubt the existence of it. Those of us who have been talking to patients are convinced that this is real, that people are suffering, and it's likely that there are many different clusters or groups of people who are experiencing things maybe with different mechanisms. But what's clear is that there are a lot of people who are affected. The CDC thinks that maybe one in four people with COVID actually ended up having symptoms that stretched beyond 4 weeks. The estimates of people who have severe symptoms is something like 3-5%, but we still need to learn a lot about this. This study sought to take people who were infected fairly early in the pandemic and look at a group that had persistent symptoms, a group that had good recovery, and a group that were just simply healthy controls. The question is, what would their symptoms show us? Were there distinguishing features about what they were experiencing? And then, what would their immune system [look like] with deep immune profiling -- looking at thousands of different features of the immune system -- could we begin to understand this better? This work was led by an MD\/PhD student, Jon Klein, led by a two-year collaboration between labs of Dave Putrino at Mount Sinai and Akiko Iwasaki at Yale, and many other people who contributed. So what were the main findings of this preprint? Again, [it's] under submission at a peer-reviewed journal, but it represents the science to date. So first of all, the patients who were reporting the long COVID symptoms had a fairly specific group of symptoms. Now, their symptoms were really broad-based, but they ended up in some clusters that were very different from any symptoms that were reported by those who were ostensibly healthy or who had gotten through COVID without really having this long COVID syndrome. The most common things were brain fog, fatigue, dysautonomia, but there were a whole wide range of symptoms that tended to distinguish the group. That represents the patient-reported side. Now on the immunophenotyping side, there were marked differences that started to become apparent, such that the group that was reporting long COVID was very different than the group that wasn't. There were some overlaps, but there were very distinctive distributions for a wide range of things, such things as exhausted T cells, or some of the interleukins, or double positive T cells, activated B cells, DN [double negative] B cells, and non-classical monocytes. Now, for those who aren't in the field, these words may not mean a lot, but the important thing is that the immune system was reflecting a sort of very different activation profile, a very different what we might call immune signature than what we were seeing in the other group. Now, the SARS-CoV-specific antibody responses were also elevated in those who were reporting long COVID after vaccination. So those who had been vaccinated were demonstrating a sort of different response, more elevated IgG and again, some differentiation between the groups. There was also evidence of herpes virus reactivation in the long COVID patients, as well as Epstein-Barr Virus. So, there were clues around here that maybe viral reactivation might be playing a role. Interestingly, there was a long look at a big list of autoantibodies, and nothing really came out of that. A lot of us have been wondering, \"Are autoantibodies at play here?\" And at least in this group, that wasn't what was suggested by the results. It seemed like, using machine learning, that this profile of long COVID was distinctive. In fact, if you just looked at the immune signatures, you could predict the group who had long COVID, who was reporting long COVID, as a result of the way these immune signatures looked. Then there was one really intriguing finding: low cortisol levels were reported more commonly in those with long COVID. And in fact, it was associated with disease severity, raising the possibility that this could be used as a screen or as a potential strong mechanism. Of course, cortisol is very strongly related to stress response, so it was a bit puzzling to see this finding. Now, all these things are going to need to be replicated. There are issues with regard to the size of this study and with regard to what the controls were. It represents a very early study and it hasn't been through peer review yet, but the most important thing is that when we took a bunch of people with long COVID symptoms, they were very distinctive with regard to their symptoms, but they were also very distinctive with regard to their immune signatures -- suggesting, indicating, demonstrating that really this is a syndrome that can be described and is reflected in biological processes. Now we just need to get going to understand it more, bring in more people, and be able to study this with greater fidelity. We're doing this at Yale; we have a study called the LISTEN Study. We're working with David [Putrino]; Akiko [Iwasaki]'s lab is at the forefront of this. You can email listenstudy@yale.edu and find out more about this study, where we're trying to bring people in and enlarge what we've done in this study of immune profiling. Lots of questions remain, but the important thing is that this supports the idea that people who are complaining of long COVID actually have physiologic issues. Many of their other tests have been normal -- that's because our tests within clinical practice are insensitive to pick this up. But using this expanded array of tests, thousands of tests, reflecting the immune system function and producing these immune signatures, we can see differences. So more to come, but this is an important contribution in our view about getting us started and [something] to build on. Emily Hutto is an Associate Video Producer & Editor for MedPage Today.

        "text":"The CDC's vaccine advisors on Thursday recommended updated COVID-19 booster shots from Pfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna that target the latest Omicron subvariants, setting aside concerns about the lack of clinical trial data with the newly formulated vaccines. In a pair of 13-1 votes, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended the bivalent vaccines from Pfizer (for individuals 12 and older) and Moderna (for individuals 18 and up) be administered a minimum of 2 months following a primary series or previous booster shot. The updated mRNA shots contain components targeting Omicron's BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, along with the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2; prior ACIP recommendations supporting the companies' monovalent mRNA vaccines as boosters have been revoked. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH, officially endorsed the recommendations shortly after the ACIP meeting, saying the updated boosters are formulated to better protect against the most recently circulating variants. \"This recommendation followed a comprehensive scientific evaluation and robust scientific discussion,\" Walensky said in a statement. \"If you are eligible, there is no bad time to get your COVID-19 booster and I strongly encourage you to receive it.\" CDC said it expects updated COVID-19 boosters for pediatric groups under 12 will come under review \"in the coming weeks.\" This marks the first time the makeup of COVID-19 vaccines have been altered since their introduction in late 2020, and many ACIP members expressed reluctance about rubber-stamping the new rollout, with concerns ranging from the lack of human data on these particular bivalent shots to the timing of administration following prior vaccine doses. \"I really feel we need the human data,\" said Pablo Sanchez, MD, of Ohio State University in Columbus, who made the only vote against the new boosters. \"It's a new vaccine, it's a new platform, there's a lot of vaccine hesitancy already.\" But Sanchez added that he's considered high risk and will almost surely take it. \"I'm not against this, it makes sense,\" he said. \"I think the vaccine will be similar to previous ones we've seen with mRNA.\" Oliver Brooks, MD, of of Watts HealthCare Corporation in Los Angeles, qualified his vote, saying he voted yes because \"it's the way seasonal influenza is done.\" To keep pace with seasonal influenza variant changes, updates to influenza boosters are regularly recommended without clinical trial data. Sarah Long, MD, of St. Christopher's Hospital for Children in Philadelphia, said she \"reluctantly\" voted yes, noting the potential to decrease hospitalization and death. In a presentation earlier in the day, Sara Oliver, MD, MPH, of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, and the lead for ACIP's work group on COVID-19 vaccines, showed projections suggesting a delay in rolling out the BA.4\/BA.5-targeted vaccines to November would result in 137,000 more hospitalizations and 9,700 more deaths. Many ACIP members struggled with the recommended 2-month interval leading up to the new bivalent shot. Brooks and others said they would recommend their patients wait 6 months, unless there's a really good reason to get a booster after 2 months. Questions about the lack of clinical trial data for both Moderna and Pfizer bivalent vaccines were woven throughout the day's discussions -- clinical data supporting the updated shots came from trials testing the companies' BA.1-targeting bivalent booster shots, which are being recommended in Europe. Mouse models presented by representatives from Moderna and Pfizer suggested the BA.4\/BA-5-directed boosters would increase neutralization for all Omicron variants. Few ACIP members questioned the safety profile of the updated booster vaccines, which they expected would be similar to what was observed with the BA.1-targeted shots, though the committee expressed concern the new recommendations would lead to more administration errors. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) data presented by CDC's Tom Shimabukuro, MD, MPH, detailed reports ranging from incorrect dosing and product administered to patients of an inappropriate age, as well as the use of expired products. \"We need to provide a clear planning for when changes will occur to labeling ... that's my request of both companies,\" ACIP Chair Grace Lee, MD, of Stanford Medicine in California, told the committee.

        "title":"Infant Head Trauma Surged in Paris During Pandemic",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.medpagetoday.com\/pediatrics\/domesticviolence\/100490",
        "text":"Abusive head trauma in infants nearly doubled in the Paris metropolitan area during the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers reported. While cases of abusive head trauma were stable in 2020 compared with years before the pandemic, averaging 1.4 cases per month, that number jumped to 2.7 cases per month in 2021 (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 1.92, 95% CI 1.23-2.99, P=0.02), according to Flora Blangis, MPH, and colleagues at the Universit\u00e9 Paris Cit\u00e9, writing in JAMA Network Open. And mortality rates from abusive head trauma in infants jumped nearly 10-fold in 2021 (odds ratio 9.39, 95% CI 1.88-47.00), the group found. \"These findings suggest that the marked increase in abusive head trauma incidence during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Paris metropolitan area should prompt clinical awareness and preventive actions,\" wrote Blangis and co-authors. \"No national prevention campaign against AHT [abusive head trauma] was implemented in France until January 2022.\" The researchers hypothesized that since the increase did not occur in the first year of the pandemic, when containment and mitigation measures were maximum, the cause may be more related to an \"accumulation of psychosocial distress over time.\" Paris is an area of particular interest to study the association between the COVID-19 pandemic and abusive head trauma incidence, the investigators noted. As a densely populated area, the city \"faced strong COVID-19 pandemic waves,\" leading to prolonged lockdowns, curfews, remote work, and daycare closures. Social isolation amplified already-known risk factors for child abuse and neglect (CAN), Blangis and co-authors said: \"Economic loss and unemployment, mental disorders such as acute and posttraumatic stress disorders and depression or suicidal behaviors are known risk factors for CAN,\" the team wrote, adding, though, that the design of the study \"did not allow deciphering the respective roles of the pandemic and these measures.\" To study the incidence of abusive head trauma in infants 12 months and younger in the Paris metropolitan area, the researchers assessed cases that presented to hospital there from 2017 to 2021. The median age of the infants was 4 months, and 65% were male. Of the 99 cases studied, 87% had bridging vein thrombosis, 75% had retinal hemorrhages, 32% had fractures, 26% had status epilepticus, and 20% had skin injuries. More than half of the children (54%) needed neurosurgical interventions, and 13% died. Writing in an accompanying editorial, however, Emily C. B. Brown, MD, of Seattle Children's Hospital, said that while this study and others have highlighted child maltreatment during the pandemic, the exact nature of the relationship between abusive head trauma incidence and the pandemic remains unclear. \"There are reasons to suspect that the pandemic and its associated stressors might be to blame for the 2021 increase of AHT in Paris; however, that conclusion cannot be drawn from this study alone,\" argued Brown. Studies on this topic have been inconsistent, she noted. Still the new study may provide some insights. In particular, if relief measures on financial stress reduced abusive head trauma in 2020, this might inform social policies in the future, in addition to targeting caregiver education. Prevention of abusive head trauma \"has long proven elusive,\" she said. Paid parental leave, and other policies have shown some reduction, Brown explained, but \"why did the factors that worked in 2020 start to fail?\" \"Because families' lives are often stressful even outside of a pandemic, once we determine which preventive measures were the most effective at reducing AHT and other forms of maltreatment during the last couple years, we may want to advocate to keep them permanently,\" Brown said.

        "text":"TTHealthWatch is a weekly podcast from Texas Tech.

Rick: Update on statin therapy for people without known cardiovascular disease. Elizabeth: How can we get office workers up and moving? Rick: How often do risk factors contribute to the development of cancer? Elizabeth: That's what we're talking about this week on TTHealthWatch, your weekly look at the medical headlines from Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso. I'm Elizabeth Tracey, a Baltimore-based medical journalist. Rick: And I'm Rick Lange, president of Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso where I'm also dean of the Paul L. Foster School of Medicine. Elizabeth: Rick, let's turn of course to the COVID material first. This is a look at physical activity and risk of infection, severity of infection, and mortality with regard to COVID-19 in the BMJ. This is a systematic review, meta-analysis of data from almost 2 million adults, obviously a ginormous dataset. These folks looked at peer-reviewed articles reporting the association between regular physical activity and at least one COVID-19 outcome in adults. They found that sure enough, those people who engaged in regular physical activity did have a lower risk of infection, hospitalization, severe illness, and death related to COVID-19 compared with inactive peers. One of the things that I thought was really interesting was this was not necessarily a dose-response kind of relationship. For those of us who are really physically active, it's kind of like, \"Well, all right, you get a benefit, but it's not greater than people who just indulge in more moderate activity.\" The greatest benefit was provided by achieving at least 500 metabolic equivalents of tasks (METs) -- that thing that people who study this are so fond of citing -- and that's equivalent to 150 minutes of moderate intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity physical activity per week. So, one more benefit of exercise. Rick: Elizabeth, you mentioned that the benefit really wasn't correlating with the amount of exercise. What I would say is, it does to that particular point that you mentioned and then it kind of levels off. Doing additional exercise didn't accrue any additional benefit. We always like to ask, is there a biologic plausibility to something like this, or is it just an association? Other studies have shown that people with increased physical activity have better immune systems and better immune responses. They also are less likely to have some of the comorbidities that are associated with more severe disease -- things like obesity, heart disease, or lung disease. Finally, they were just in better shape and able to tolerate viral illnesses. Not only this one, but other viral illnesses as well, so there is some biologic plausibility. Elizabeth: Yeah. I think that some of this, of course, could be explained by that healthy user effect -- that is, that whole constellation of things that you've already cited. Something that would be of interest to me would be what about if you adopt an exercise program, how quickly do these kinds of benefits start to kick in. Rick: That's a good point. In other words, if you develop COVID, should you suddenly start exercising? The answer is probably not. You're not going to receive the benefit at that particular time. One of the shortcomings of this is it's self-reported. It's just somebody saying, \"Oh, yes. I exercised this amount of time.\" It's a single point. It doesn't talk about how long people have been doing it or what kind of cardiorespiratory fitness they have. But I think you and I would agree that in general, people that are more cardiovascularly fit tolerate a number of different illnesses better, are more likely to recover, and have less severe manifestations, so good news. Elizabeth: Yep, and of course points directly to our wheelhouse and our bias. Let's turn then to JAMA. Let's look at this issue of we have quipped about statins in the water. What is the role of statins in people who do not have cardiovascular disease that we know about? Rick: This is an update from the United States Preventive [Services] Task Force. It's an update from 2016 -- they review the available data -- looking at the use of statins for primary prevention; that is, people that don't have cardiovascular disease. They never had a heart attack. They never had symptoms or bypass surgery or a stroke. Should statins be used in these individuals to prevent those things? That's why it's called primary prevention. On one hand, even after the update, I would say really things haven't changed very much. They are recommending statins in individuals between the ages of 40 to 75 with one or more cardiovascular risk factors -- things like elevated cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking -- and an estimated cardiovascular risk of greater than 10% -- that is, over the next 10 years will they have a 10% or a higher likelihood that they have some cardiovascular manifestation? Those individuals should be placed on statin. You say, \"All right, well, how do we figure this out?\" It's a pool cohort estimate based upon the population at large. You plug in your information and it gives you what your risk is. Here is the unfortunate thing. It's heavily weighted towards age and gender as well. Let me draw an analysis. If you're a non-Black woman under the age of 55, less than 1% of those would fall in that category. That means hardly any of them would be on a statin. Conversely, if you're over the age of 70 and you're a Black male, 90% of those would be on a statin. Well, what you don't want to do is you don't want to wait to the end of someone's life to start them on a statin. Let's say someone has very high cholesterol and they are aged 40, you'd want to start them because the atherosclerotic process occurs over decades and you don't want to wait till it's already fully developed. That's one of the shortcomings of this. What I'd say is even though these are good guidelines they need to be individualized for individual patients because this looks at it at a population basis, but we need to look at each individual to decide whether they would benefit from statins or not. Elizabeth: Right, and I also think we need to note that a lot of these guidelines that purport to assess risk have been based on men. We also know that they are based on different ethnicities and so there has got to be a more complete rendering of that, in my opinion, in order to inform the guidelines. Rick: Right. Again, this pool cohort estimate, this equation, tries to account for that. But studies that have been validated say it really overestimate some populations and it underestimates others. Although it's a great guideline, it can be helpful, you really do have to individualize statin therapy. Again, in these individuals, they significantly reduce cardiovascular death, the risk of heart attack, and the risk of stroke. Elizabeth: My guess is we're not done with this issue yet because certainly when we were quipping, \"Should we put statins in the water?\" there were other benefits of statins outside of their reduction in cardiovascular disease risk. Rick: Right. One of the nice things about this particular study is based upon hundreds of thousands of patients they looked at the safety of statins to say, well, do they cause liver disease? Not really. Do they increase the risk of diabetes; that was once rumored? Not really. Do they increase the risk of myalgias? Actually, not really in the general population. They are very safe and at the same time very effective. They are generic, so they're low-cost. In addition to that, they are taken once daily, so a lot of benefits to individuals that could benefit from them. Elizabeth: We'll be hearing more. Speaking of benefits, if you work in an office, how can we get you up and get you moving? This is in the BMJ. This is a look at this intervention that they call SWAL: Smart Work and Life intervention. Then they also have SWAL plus desk and that's a desk that is height adjustable so that you can get up and stand instead of sitting the whole time that you're in your office. This group has been doing this kind of work for a while. They randomized 756 desk-based employees in offices, departments, or whatever, in the U.K. They were randomized to one of three conditions: 1) the SWAL intervention, 2) the SWAL intervention with the desk, or 3) the control, the usual practice. They also support these folks with all kinds of electronic interventions to help them to remember to get up, to do other things rather than just sit at their desk during their workday. The mean age of their participants was just shy of 45 years. The majority were women. Sure enough, they found that among the SWAL group, which they had looked at this intervention before, there were 22 minutes less of sitting per day in that group. In the ones who got the desk, it was almost 64 minutes a day that they sat less compared to those folks who were just in the control group. Clearly, the SWAL plus desk is really helpful. What they did not identify in this study, and I read it really carefully, was, \"What's it cost to provide such a desk to an office worker?\" I suspect that might have something to do with the employment of this intervention. Rick: This SWAL involves a number of things. It involves organizational strategies, environmental strategies, and group and individual strategies using social cognitive theory, organization development theory, habit theory, self-regulation theory, relapse prevention theory -- a lot of theories -- and teamwork and team leaders. Here is the thing I found disappointing and these were primarily people who had a desk job. It did decrease the amount of time they sat and it increased the amount of time they stood. It didn't increase their overall physical activity, especially outside of the work. Obviously, if you give someone a desk where you can stand and the goal was to get him to try to stand about 2 hours per day total, they will spend more time standing, as you said. But it didn't translate into increased physical activity either at the worksite -- that is more steps -- or outside. That was disappointing. Your thoughts? Elizabeth: Yeah. That is disappointing that it doesn't translate and get people to think about other strategies for getting up and moving around while they are in the workplace. I guess I would just note that societally, of course, we are seeing a great shift toward remote work. Maybe that means that people will get up more and I would be interested in that comparison of people who were work remotely versus people who work in an office because these office cultures are really shifting quite a lot. Rick: Yeah, and then they also asked people how they felt. The answer was there was a small difference, but it really wasn't clinically meaningful. Elizabeth: Let's turn finally to The Lancet, another ginormous study looking at the global burden of cancer that's attributable to risk factors -- many modifiable risk factors I would note. Rick: Yeah, and that's exactly what this study did. They tried to understand the magnitude of the cancer burden that was attributable to risk factors that are potentially modifiable. This is called the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors study, the GBD study, done in 2019 and it looked over a 10-year period. Here is what they discovered. The risk factors included in this analysis accounted for 4.45 million deaths and 105 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs) for men and women across the globe. Unfortunately, this only represented about 44% of all cancer deaths and 42% of all DALYs. What that means is there is still a lot of cancer that even when we modify risk factors we're not going to be able to prevent, but about 45% we potentially could. The major risk factors were smoking, followed by alcohol use and high BMI. There were other risk factors as well, environmental risk factors and other risk factors. It changed geographically across the globe, but overall smoking, alcohol, and a high BMI. Elizabeth: Clearly all of those are modifiable. We also know that the burden of obesity is increasing worldwide, not just domestically. It just seems to me like these are really critical things that need to be addressed from a multitude of strategies. Rick: There are. This is a very dense study -- I think a very comprehensive one as well. Elizabeth: Lots of action points here. On that note then, that's a look at this week's medical headlines from Texas Tech. I'm Elizabeth Tracey. Rick: And I'm Rick Lange. Y'all listen up and make healthy choices. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.",

        "text":"The FDA on Wednesday authorized bivalent COVID-19 booster shots from Pfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna that target the original strain along with the Omicron BA.4\/BA.5 subvariants. In an amendment to the emergency use authorizations (EUAs), both shots can be administered starting 2 months following a primary vaccination series or prior booster -- in people 12 and up for Pfizer's shot and in people 18 and up for Moderna's vaccine. \"The FDA has been planning for the possibility that the composition of the COVID-19 vaccines would need to be modified to address circulating variants,\" Peter Marks, MD, PhD, of FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. \"We sought input from our outside experts on the inclusion of an omicron component in COVID-19 boosters to provide better protection against COVID-19. We have worked closely with the vaccine manufacturers to ensure the development of these updated boosters was done safely and efficiently.\" Of note, clinical data supporting the EUA amendment were derived from studies on bivalent vaccines that targeted the original Omicron strain, but the agency said it considers such data as \"relevant and supportive\" of the newer BA.4\/BA.5-targeted vaccines. Support for the vaccines' efficacy came in the form of immunogenicity data. The studies for each vaccine involved about 600 fully vaccinated adults who had already received a booster shot as well. Immune responses to BA.1 were superior in individuals receiving either of the companies' bivalent vaccines -- which included components targeting the ancestral strain as well as Omicron BA.1 -- compared to those that received the original monovalent boosters targeting only the original strain. This rollout is \"similar to situations we've done in the past with influenza strain changes ... we don't do clinical studies for them in the United States,\" Marks said during a press briefing on Wednesday. \"To stave off serious outcomes and symptomatic disease, one needs to refresh the immune system with what is actually circulating,\" he said. \"BA.1 is no longer circulating.\" CDC's variant proportions tracker shows that the BA.5 Omicron subvariant makes up 88.7% of cases in the U.S., while BA.4 makes up 3.6% and BA.4.6 makes up 7.5% of cases. Prior research in individuals infected with BA.4 or BA.5 has demonstrated robust protection against a variety of other variants, including BA.1, Delta, and Beta, Marks noted. \"The hope here is that by increasing the amount of antibodies we have to that particular variant, we will restore the protection we had when these [vaccines] were launched -- that is the goal here,\" he said. Safety data for Wednesday's authorization were derived from studies on the BA.1-targeting bivalent vaccines in 800 adults 18 and up for Moderna's shot and in 600 adults 55 and older for Pfizer's. Commonly reported side effects for the vaccines included injection site pain, redness, and swelling, lymph node swelling in the arm of the injection, as well as chills, fever, fatigue, headache, muscle or joint pain, and nausea or vomiting. \"We are confident in the evidence supporting these authorizations,\" he said. Monovalent mRNA vaccines that target the original SARS-CoV-2 strain will no longer be authorized as boosters in people 12 and up, the agency said. Marks said he expects the FDA will authorize bivalent boosters for children in the next month or two. Before shots can go into arms, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will need to weigh in with their recommendation; ACIP is scheduled to meet on Thursday and Friday of this week.

Thank you for joining us here on Anamnesis, a medical storytelling podcast from MedPage Today. My name is Shannon Firth. I'm a reporter with MedPage and I'll be your host for this episode. For those of you who listen in regularly, this month's episode will be a little different. Instead of three stories from individual clinicians on a theme, we're bringing you just one story. An important story focused on the underreported, sometimes overlooked, challenges for nurses who struggle with substance use. During the pandemic, the public romanticized the role of nurses, casting them as superheroes -- women and men who sacrificed everything for their patients. But for many, the grief, stress, and exhaustion took a toll. In one survey, nearly half of critical care nurses said they felt depressed, and a third said they were drinking more. Six percent said they felt suicidal. And that's where the story of Tiffany Swedeen comes in. Over the holidays, a nurse in recovery from opioid use disorder struggled to keep her addiction in check. She was caring for coronavirus patients on the front lines in an ICU outside Seattle. She asked her hospital for more support, and received little. She reached out to her family, but that just made things worse. On Sunday, January 3, 2021, Tiffany Swedeen relapsed. Tiffany's story highlights the fact that when it comes to substance use disorders, our healthcare system has one standard for patients and another for nurses. And while nurses have responsibilities not only to themselves, but to the public, it's worth remembering that substance use disorder is still a chronic but treatable brain disease, and not a moral failing. This episode of Anamnesis features discussions of drug abuse and suicide that may be disturbing to some listeners. Discretion is advised. Chapter 1. Blacked Out on Fentanyl for a Day (2:40) -- A nurse in recovery shares one of her loneliest moments. Chapter 2.

        "link":"https:\/\/www.medpagetoday.com\/opinion\/faustfiles\/100026",
        "text":"In the first part of this two-part conversation, Jeremy Faust, MD, editor-in-chief of MedPage Today, talks with Paul Offit, MD, about his recent decision to vote against the bivalent COVID-19 booster shot at a recent meeting of FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). Offit is director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), attending physician in the division of infectious diseases at CHOP, and Maurice R. Hilleman Professor of Vaccinology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. The following is a transcript of their remarks: Jeremy Faust, MD: Hello, I'm Jeremy Faust, medical editor-in-chief of MedPage Today. Thanks for joining us. Today we are joined by Dr. Paul Offit. He is a member of the FDA Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, the VRBPAC, which is the committee that publicly discusses, and debates, and ultimately votes on recommendations related to the COVID-19 vaccines and their authorization for use. Dr. Paul Offit, thank you so much for joining us. Paul Offit, MD: My pleasure. Faust: Let's start by talking about an article you wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine, 'COVID-19 boosters -- where from here?' You argued, essentially, that these mRNA vaccines in particular were designed to do something very specific, which is to prevent severe disease and deaths, and that they happen to temporarily do what everyone else wants them to do, which is to decrease infections. It seems to me that a lot of people are looking at boosters and they don't realize it, but they're treating them like they're almost prophylaxis, and I think that, in your view, is not a sustainable way to do things. How do you think this is going to play out? Offit: I think probably you can trace the confusion back to December of 2020. In December of 2020, the FDA vaccine advisory committee was asked to consider both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Those were two-dose vaccines given 3 or 4 weeks apart, and protection against mild, moderate, and severe disease was 95%. Those vaccines were roughly 95% effective at preventing not only severe illness, but also mild illness. Then what happened was 6 months later, the CDC did studies showing that protection against severe disease holding up, which is good, but the protection against mild disease was fading -- as you would've guessed -- because protection against mild diseases, for the most part, is mediated by neutralizing antibodies present at the time of infection, and those faded. So why was it 95% protection against mild disease in December of 2020? Those were 3-month studies. Those participants had just gotten their second dose. So therefore, you sort of had this unrealistic sense of what this was all about. That was the way it was handled, not only by the media, but I think in many ways by public health officials; officials who use words like 'fading immunity' or 'breakthrough infections' when you were seeing exactly what you would expect to see. Even 1 year later, when studies were done by Mark Tenforde out of the CDC, with just two doses you found that protection against severe disease was holding up. Then Omicron hit, which was an immune-evasive strain, and caused mild illness even in those who were vaccinated. I think this sort of led to a lot of confusion and ultimately led to a third dose and then to a fourth dose. And I think we used terms like 'fully vaccinated' as compared to 'fully vaccinated and up-to-date,' and I think it would be hard to find 10 Americans who would agree on what it means to be protected against this virus. Faust: I think that's fair. Now, I actually think this next question is sort of out of order, but I think it's important that we do it first. That is that you are, as I mentioned in the introduction, on the committee -- VRBPAC -- that looks at these questions of what we should do next and makes recommendations, and you voted against the bivalent booster. That is, using a booster that's got some of the old strain and some of the Omicron [strain] in it. You voted against that for the fall. I'd like you to talk us through your thought process and why you think that doing it your way would be better. Offit: The studies that were presented to us on June 28 of this year, 2022, by both Pfizer and Moderna were done the right way, which is to say they gave people three doses of the ancestral strain vaccine and then the fourth dose was either the ancestral strain vaccine or the fourth dose was a bivalent vaccine. The bivalent vaccine in both cases, for Pfizer and Moderna, was the ancestral strain plus BA.1, the original Omicron strain. They then looked at the difference in those neutralizing antibody responses based on whether you got the ancestral boost or whether you got the bivalent boost. What they found was -- depending on how the study was done because Pfizer did 30 mcg or 60 mcg and Moderna did 25 mcg for the ancestral and then 25 mcg for the Omicron strain -- they found that the difference in neutralizing antibodies was either 1.5-fold greater against neutralizing antibodies for Omicron if you got the bivalent strains compared to if you just got the ancestral strain, or 1.75 greater, or 1.97 greater. The implication was that that's good enough; that those statistically significant differences were also clinically significant differences, when we knew that back in December of 2020 -- when you looked at the neutralizing antibody differences between Moderna and Pfizer -- there was roughly a twofold greater neutralizing antibody response for Moderna than Pfizer, but that didn't really matter in terms of protection against severe illness. So why were we making this difference of 1.5-fold or 1.97-fold greater with the Omicron boost than the ancestral boost? Why were we making that seem as if that was going to be the answer to all our problems? Plus, the BA.1 strain is essentially gone. It's been replaced by BA.5\/BA.4 and now BA.2.12.1, which are just Omicron subvariants that are somewhat distant from BA.1. So where this is settled out is that I think the [Biden] administration is interested in having a bivalent vaccine where one of the strains is the ancestral strain and the other strain is BA.5. And we'll see, but I certainly hope that before they launch that kind of program for the American public, they show clear evidence that there is a dramatic increase in neutralizing antibodies with BA.5 associated with that boost. Because remember, even with boosting the ancestral strain, you do get somewhat of a broadening of immune response as Linda Saif and coauthors showed in a New England Journal Medicine paper at the end of June. So I think that's the burden that it should be held to because otherwise it's just marketing, right? Otherwise it's like, 'I'm going to give you BA.5 because BA.5 is circulating and therefore it's going to be better,' which theoretically makes sense, but you need to have clear evidence, preferably clinical data, but at the very least compelling immunological data. Faust: Now, would moving to a bivalent booster just in general be progress against this concern about 'imprinting or antigenic sin'? The idea is that whatever your body sees first, it will sort of narrowly respond to that. Therefore in the future, your body doesn't have as good of a response because of what it initially saw. Does giving bivalent anything actually have some benefit just on those grounds? Offit: Again, it should be proven, but the imprinting thing was originally defined by a researcher named Thomas Francis, who was working with influenza back in the 50s, and he used the term 'original antigenic sin.' The thinking was this, you can tell when children were born based on the way they respond to influenza -- either natural infection or immunization -- because they respond as if they're responding to that original infection. The original infection that they had when they were children, if they then get a vaccine or a secondary infection, they're responding as if they're responding to that first infection and not recognizing the subtle differences with that either vaccine or natural infection. That's what you worry about here, that you sort of lock people into this response against the ancestral strain and don't have the chance then to have a broader response. I will say this though, the ancestral strain is the original strain. It's the Wuhan strain. The one that first raised its head in Wuhan in October\/November 2019 has served us well. I mean, all the way through, even including Omicron and the Omicron subvariants, it does appear to continue to protect against serious illness, which is the goal of this vaccine. At least it was the stated goal of this vaccine, but I feel like we're drifting a little bit from protection against serious illness to trying to protect against all illness. And I would argue that there are some people who can't handle a mild illness. They can't handle it because they have severe heart disease or severe lung disease or because they have out of control diabetes or whatever, so when they get a mild or moderate infection they're more likely to develop a severe illness or because they're immune compromised. So that's different. That's really not fading memory, it's someone who either never had a very good immune response because they're immune compromised or because of their age they don't make very good so-called cytotoxic T-cell responses, so they're not as able to crowd the infection and keep it as a mild or moderate infection. You could argue that that group may benefit from a boost, if you will, to keep neutralizing antibodies high, to the extent they can make neutralizing antibodies for a few months during the times when these viruses are at peak circulation, you could make that argument. But I think we're sort of not making that argument; we're making the argument of boosters for all. And first of all, I think people are a little weary of boosters at this point. Faust: Yeah. I mean, the way I'm looking at it is that people who, as you mentioned, have another risk factor for hospitalization probably need to stay what we'd call 'up-to-date' on their vaccine so that they don't encounter mild illness because mild illness has implications for them that they don't have for others. It's not that they'll get severe disease; severe COVID, it's that that mild illness will make something else severe. That's what we keep seeing, and the data are bearing this out. So, absolutely, I think saying up-to-date for older populations makes sense. I don't think the mRNA vaccines are optimized for this, but they're the best we've got, so that's what we're stuck with for now. But I agree with you that we could kind of spend all of our effort on that group and have huge benefits instead of diffusing the efforts, the money, the signal, for very little in return. As I think about younger people, some younger people obviously really want doses. They've bought into this idea that these vaccines can eliminate infection. I think you and I agree on this, the benefit for boosting for young people is very transient, if any, but over time I think arguments have been made that say, 'OK, look, there's a lot of good reasons to boost younger people.' Where do you stand right now? Do you still think that two doses of the ancestral vaccine is sufficient for most people, and have you softened on third doses for younger people? I guess the third question of this three-part is: who do you think right now needs more than two doses? Offit: I still would argue that for a healthy young person, two doses appears to continue to protect against severe illness. What that third dose does do though for Omicron, meaning BA.1 and the Omicron subvariants, is you do get an increased response against those variants and subvariants. The question is, does it matter? Because still it looks like you're protected against severe illness, so does it really matter to get that third dose? I would argue 'no.' [But] I think that ship has sailed. I think this is now a three-dose vaccine for the most part, because that's the way the press and the public have handled it, it's the way public administrators have handled it. But I still would argue, if you looked at that Mark Tenforde paper that was published in Infectious Diseases, what he did was he looked at two doses for 1 year, up through December of 2021 so the vaccine had been out for a year -- so you're looking through the D614G variant, the Alpha variant, and the Delta variant -- and what he found was that protection against serious illness was holding up. And this was for...80% of the people in that group had at least one comorbidity and a significant percentage were over [age] 65. So that was holding up pretty well. But then Omicron hit, and we clearly have shown that three doses is better than two for Omicron in terms of preventing hospitalization. My question is: who are those people? And I think that's not everybody. I still think it would be helpful for the CDC to sort of sub-stratify that. To some extent they have; they've shown us that at least 75% of those who are getting hospitalized despite having two doses were in these high-risk groups that we just talked about. So focus on them. I think that is what makes the most sense to me. Faust: Yeah. If you look at the CDC's readouts -- I think we've discussed this before offline, but I'm not sure we've discussed it in public -- it's actually very difficult to tell the difference between a person who got their second dose a year ago and a person who got their third dose a year ago. So the idea of the three-dose vaccine kind of only makes sense in that in the period of time for which a third dose increases those neutralizing antibodies. So yes, you could tell the difference between someone who just got a third dose, but you also can't tell the difference between someone who just got a third dose and someone who just got their second dose. What really matters is how far are you out from your most recent dose, and I think that the public is basically not going to keep doing this except for high-risk groups. Is that a fair read? Offit: Very fair. And I think when we compare vaccinated to unvaccinated or got a two-dose versus three-dose you need to also account for who has gotten naturally infected in the meantime, because that does alter things. And it is knowable, I mean, you can know that by looking at say antibodies against, say, the nuclear protein, which is only going to happen if you've been naturally infected. So I think that also is one of the problems -- controlling for natural infection, which now is common. I remember when a couple months into this pandemic, Jon Yewdell, who was the head of virus research at the National Institutes of Health, said 3 years from now you're going to have two choices: be naturally affected or be vaccinated. If you look at some of these recent seroprevalence studies, there was one in JAMA recently, showing that as many as 90% of people have either been naturally infected or vaccinated when they look at the thousands and thousands of lots of people who have donated blood. Now, that's limited by who chooses to donate blood, but I still think it is striking. Faust: Right. And I think maybe a cognitive shift that I made at some point was that you might not necessarily choose between infection or vaccination, but you have to choose infection with protection or infection without protection. In other words, you walk into that infection or that exposure with a vaccine on board or not, and you want to do that, obviously. I want to make sure that we don't make incorrect news here. You said that you think it's a three-dose vaccine, but you said that because you think that basically the scientific debate is over because no one is having it. Not because of science support stuff but basically due to marketing, is that correct? Offit: Yeah. I just got an email today from a mother of a college student who was upset that her child can't go to a certain East Coast school because he hasn't had his third dose. She argues reasonably -- he's a healthy young person, he's gotten two doses, he's a boy who is in an age range where he is at some risk for myocarditis, and I don't think the benefits outweigh the risks here. A perfectly reasonable argument. I agree. I agree with her. Faust: But I also think that, as my friend Carter Mecher pointed out to me when we discussed this like a year ago, that most people who get a third dose, even in that group of a young, healthy male, most people will be happy with their decision to get a third dose because for 99% it makes no difference. For a small, tiny group it would help; for a small, tiny group it would hurt. So most people would just be happy with their decision because whatever they did, they think, 'Well, I got a third dose. I did my best.' Therefore the administration is saying, 'Well, look, if it breaks even we might as well just make everybody happy.' Offit: Yeah. There was an old study that was done at a Canadian racetrack where they asked people to rate their horse while they were on the way up to making the bet, then they asked a different group of people to rate their horse after they'd already made the bet. Obviously, after you already made the bet, you rated it much higher. But what I loved about that article was the title, which was \"Post-decision dissonance at post time.\" Faust: Right. Post-vax something or other -- we could do it with that. The mix and match, the idea of starting with one formulation of Pfizer and then boosting with Moderna, do you think it matters? Certainly, it has a little bit more of an antibody response and more side effects, but on a population level do you think it matters? If someone asks you, 'What should I do?,' what do you tell them? Offit: Wait for data. I mean, it is interesting to see some of these early reports now of boosting with Novavax, which is a purified protein vaccine that's adjuvanted with the same adjuvant that's used in Shingrix, which is an exceptional vaccine. If you've already gotten, say, two doses or three doses of an mRNA vaccine and then you get this dose of Nova, the antibody studies, at least the small ones that have been reported so far, look promising. But again, you ultimately need clinical data, and hopefully the CDC can help generate those data. Emily Hutto is an Associate Video Producer & Editor for MedPage Today. She is based in Manhattan.

        "text":"In the second part of this two-part conversation, Jeremy Faust, MD, editor-in-chief of MedPage Today, and Paul Offit, MD, discuss the ambiguity of long COVID, the risks of pediatric COVID, and the \"human price to pay for knowledge.\" Offit is director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), attending physician in the division of infectious diseases at CHOP, and Maurice R. Hilleman Professor of Vaccinology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. He is also a member of the FDA Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. Watch part one of this two-part discussion here. The following is a transcript of their remarks: Jeremy Faust, MD: If you're advising my parents, who are in their 70s, should they get their fourth dose right now because they haven't gotten it yet? Or should they wait until the bivalent [vaccine] comes on in the fall because they're trying to avoid infection or anything else? So what should they do? Should they just do it now? Or should they wait? Paul Offit, MD: First of all, it's really hard to avoid infection. It is. I mean, these are highly contagious viruses; they're immune evasive. It's a short incubation-period mucosal respiratory infection, so at some level, we're going to have to try and find a way to accept mild infection. Even for those who are at highest risk, what are we going to do? Boost twice a year? It is just not a practical strategy, I think. In answer to your question, I guess I would wait and see what the data show. Hopefully we'll have much more vigorous data regarding this sort of bivalent vaccine that contains BA5 because it looks like that's the way the [Biden] administration wants to go. We'll have clear data on that, and if that's true, then I would wait because I really do think people make a mistake when they give boosters very close together. You really should wait several months to do that. I disagree with the people who occasionally say, 'Well, get it now and then you can get it again later.' No, let's wait; wait until later to see what this BA5 looks like. Faust: Alright, let's talk about vaccines and long COVID. We know that we know nothing, but there's certainly a concern that this virus, this pandemic, is sort of a mass event for creating disability. Even if there's a range of estimates on how much long COVID there is, and even if the lowest estimates are true, it's still a ton of people. Do you think we're going to get a readout on whether vaccines and boosts in particular help otherwise healthy people avoid long COVID, or is that just going to be impossible to sort out? Offit: Well, you said it, we need to define this phenomenon of long COVID. Right now, you read estimates that range anywhere from 5% of people who suffer natural infection up to 50% of people. For example, the United States has a higher rate of long COVID than Europe does, so we have a definition problem. We clearly need to define it as objectively as possible because it's a real entity, and the part of it that worries me is the vasculitis part. I mean, this is a virus that can cause you to make an immune response to your own endothelial cells that line blood vessels, so therefore all organs are at risk. You do need to have a defined way of doing this because now if you look at these meta-analyses, the symptom that seems to come up to the top most frequently is fatigue, which is hard to define. Fatigue, pain, those are whatever you say they are. It's not like measuring your blood pressure or temperature. It's not so easily defined, so define it! Find a much clearer way of defining it than saying, 'Are you tired when you get up in the morning? Have you been tired for weeks?' because it sets itself up for just including far more people. I feel sorry now for employers and for insurance companies that are now going to try and figure out how to deal with the massive amount of disability that no doubt is going to follow this virus. We need to define it immunologically, virologically, and at some level, psychologically. We have to do that. We have to because it's going to be a big hit associated with this diagnosis. Faust: Long COVID is obviously a concern across the age spectrum, but a lot of young people are worried about it. But there's a group of people that are really maybe relatively low risk, but really of our concern and is an area of great interest in your career, and this is pediatrics; in kids. What's your stance on pediatric vaccines? And how do you respond to the idea that COVID either isn't that bad for kids and they don't need a vaccine, or maybe even if it is on a population level, too many have been exposed anyway so why do it? Where are we on pediatric COVID vaccines? Offit: Right. Well, we all have our biases. I guess mine is that I work at a children's hospital, so I do see children come into our hospital who suffer this disease. If you look sort of just at the data that we were presented at the FDA vaccine advisory committee when we made this decision in mid-June about vaccines for less than 5-year-olds, it is clear that there are at least millions of children who've been infected who are less than 5 years of age. It's also clear that at least children have been hospitalized -- and if you look at the CDC data, thousands and thousands have been hospitalized, and according to CDC data, about 200 have died from this virus. Now, you want to make sure you have good data there. Is it that they're getting hospitalized or dying with this virus or from this virus? We need to make that very clear, and I think that's a little less clear. I can certainly say that we see children who come into our hospital because they have COVID or are treated because they have COVID; some of whom end up in the intensive care unit. It's real, and for that reason it should be prevented. So then the question becomes when is the best time to vaccinate, I think. Because if you make the assumption that the virus can cause death at any age -- which is true -- if you make the assumption that this virus is going to be with us for years, if not decades, which I think is also true, then the question is: When to vaccinate? Because every year in this country 3.5 to more than 4 million children are brought into this world who are fully susceptible to this virus, and this virus is going to be around for a long time. We are going to need to have a high level of population immunity to protect them. So [the question] when to vaccinate, is what I would argue. Now, in the worst case scenario, it may be that if you find that memory responses, which were associated generally with protection against severe disease, fade after 5 years or 10 years and you need to re-vaccinate later, fine. But at least you've protected them during that period of time. Faust: Can I ask you for a clinical impression? I'll set it up by sharing a little bit of mine. In early 2020, COVID pneumonia was on every x-ray. They come in and it's like, 'Wow, this is a crazy x-ray. Why do I keep seeing this thing?' And then in the Delta\/Omicron period, where you had a lot of people coming into the hospital even though they were vaccinated, that group didn't have COVID pneumonia. They were being hospitalized for emphysema, but COVID exacerbated it so it's COVID's fault, but it's not COVID pneumonia. What do you see in kids who are unvaccinated who get hospitalized? Are they having that COVID pneumonia like I was seeing in early 2020, or is it a kid who's dehydrated who just can't go home? Offit: No. I was on service a few weeks ago and we saw an unvaccinated adolescent who came in, who clearly had COVID pneumonia. I mean, he was sick. He required supplemental oxygen; his oxygen saturation levels were low. If you looked at his x-ray and his CT scan, it was striking and clearly COVID pneumonia. Faust: And what do you say to people who were out there saying, 'Look, this is so rare [in kids]. We don't need to make kids have to get vaccinated. They don't have hypoxia.' You know, the downplayers, how do you reach them? What do you say to them? Offit: It's not rare enough. I think if this was like rhinovirus, and it's basically a common cold virus, and it's not the kind of thing that's going to cause you to be hospitalized or go to the ICU or die, fine. But it's not that virus; this virus is much scarier. The scariest aspect to me is this MIS-C, this multisystem inflammatory disease in children, which is striking. You have a child, typically between 5 and 13 years of age -- an average 9 years of age -- who comes in and usually has a fairly trivial infection that was picked up serendipitously because they were exposed to a friend or family member. A month later, they come back; they're not shedding virus, they're antigen negative; PCR negative, but they have high fever, they have evidence of pulmonary disease, kidney disease, heart disease, liver disease. It is a frightening illness and they will occasionally die. That is a post-infectious inflammatory disease that is caused by a respiratory virus, and I haven't seen anything like that before. That to me is the most compelling reason to get vaccinated, actually, because it's just so different from what you normally see. But, you know, this virus can cause severe illness. Yes, it's relatively rare, but it certainly compares to the other viruses for which we have vaccines. I mean, if you're willing to get a polio vaccine or a flu vaccine or a chickenpox vaccine or measles vaccine, this virus compares to those in terms of how likely it is to kill you. Faust: We're running out of time, but I can't resist, why is it that MIS-C, this multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, seems to have gone down in incidents in the Delta and Omicron period? This is a tremendous relief, but why do we think that happened? Offit: It has. I mean, I think it was the data out of South Africa regarding Omicron and subvariants that [said] that MIS-C is definitely less common. You would have to argue that the price that the virus is paying to be more contagious, which is to say the mutations that are associated with immune evasiveness, are also associated with a lesser virulence... Faust: Which favors spread of the virus, actually. Offit: Right, In theory, if you anthropomorphize the virus, it's never to the virus' advantage to kill you. I mean, if it wants to live, and presumably it does, then it's easier to spread from person to person if you're not dead. Faust: Right. At the extremes, the symptomatology has some impact on the reproductive number, but only at the extremes. Other than that, a little bit more virulent, a little bit less; it doesn't matter. I think you are the perfect person to ask this, what I think will be my final question: That is that whenever we are looking at a therapeutic or a vaccine or any intervention in a pandemic environment, you have to balance the need to act with incomplete information in an emergency setting versus waiting until you have enough data that says this is a safe, effective, and even cost-effective approach. How do you balance that? I sense that your balance is a little bit more towards the second one when you sense it is safe to wait, but how do you tell people to make that balance? Because most people are saying, 'Oh, we've got to act. We've got to act, forget it, no time for data.' Offit: Right. Good question. We on the FDA vaccine advisory committee have continued to face that ever since December of 2020, especially for the childhood vaccines; for the vaccine for less than 5-year-olds. Because the question is never 'When do you know everything?,' because you never know everything. The question is, 'When do you know enough?' When do you cross that line where you feel comfortable that you know enough [while] knowing there's always a human price to pay for knowledge. I mean, if you go back to December 2020, there was a death in that placebo group associated with that. I give a lot of credit to these parents who volunteer for these trials knowing their child may be injected with a placebo, knowing that their child may suffer the disease because of that decision. And it's the same for us, because the decision not to get a vaccine is not a risk-free choice. It's just a choice to take a different risk. Our goal is to try and figure out how to advise parents or others to take the lesser risk. I'll just add one story because I'm an old person, as you can see since this is a video. I'm a child of the fifties. If you look at the polio vaccine story. So we always hail Jonas Salk, rightfully, as a critical researcher in the development of the polio vaccine. Well, when we did that trial -- when Thomas Francis ran that so-called Francis Field Trial of the polio vaccine between 1954 and 1955 -- you had 1.2 million children who were vaccinated, ultimately. It was about 400,000 children that were vaccinated with the inactivated vaccine, 200,000 received the placebo shot, and you had another 1.2 million children who were observed on inactivated controls. It was like a 1.8-million child study; a huge study. Jonas Salk didn't want to do that study. He didn't. He felt he'd vaccinated 700 children in the Pittsburgh area, he thought that the immune response was excellent, it was an inactivated vaccine, he could not imagine that anyone should ever do a trial with a placebo. He couldn't conscience that trial. The 1.2 million children who were observed uninoculated were really a nod to him. He did not want to inoculate children with placebo in the mid-1950s, knowing that every year 20,000 to 30,000 children suffered paralysis, and about 1,500 children died of polio. So when Thomas Francis gets up and he makes the announcement that the vaccine was safe, potent, and effective -- three words that appeared on the headline of every newspaper in this country -- how did he know it was effective? He knew it was effective because 16 children died of polio in that study, all in the placebo group. He knew it was effective because there were 36 children who were paralyzed in that study, 34 in the placebo group. Those were first and second graders in the 1950s; I was a first and second grader in the 1950s. Those children could have lived long, productive lives but for the flip of a coin. There is always a human price to pay for knowledge, and that's the hardest part of all of this. Faust: And yet if they don't do that study, or they don't do the study today, how many people will die or have bad outcomes because they say, 'Well, I'm not going to do it just because some fancy doctor said it works'? People will be convinced, ultimately, by a combination of education through their pediatricians or through the press, or even through experience where they say, 'Look, every kid I know who had this bad outcome didn't have a vaccine.' Eventually, the anecdotal evidence kind of piles up in a way that's meaningful. Is that fair? Offit: I mean, you're certainly right. You don't convince people without doing those kinds of studies. And in fact, if you look at these two mRNA vaccines, as big as those studies were that were presented back in December 2020 -- 40,000 for Pfizer and 30,000 for Moderna, those are the size of any typical pediatric or adult vaccine trial -- still, we didn't know about myocarditis or pericarditis as a consequence of that vaccine. You knew that only when millions of children were vaccinated. Maurice Hilleman, who I consider to be the father of modern vaccines in many ways because he did the primary research development on nine of the 14 vaccines that we give children, said it best. He said, 'I never breathe a sigh of relief until the first 3 million doses are out there.\" But that's never going to be done pre-licensure or preapproval. So that's how you learn. Medical innovation invariably comes with a human cost either way, either because you do get the vaccine or because you don't get the vaccine. Faust: Dr. Paul Offit, thank you so much for joining us. Your analysis has been almost singular in the public conversation in terms of balancing what I would call an exceedingly pro-vaccine stance while insisting on excellent science so that we eventually reach the most people. So thank you for doing that and for joining us here today. Offit: My pleasure. Thank you. Emily Hutto is an Associate Video Producer & Editor for MedPage Today. She is based in Manhattan.

        "text":"Table of contents A version of this story appeared in Science, Vol 377, Issue 6608. Download PDF When Alice Hughes downloaded a preprint from the server Research Square in September 2021, she could hardly believe her eyes. The study described a massive effort to survey bat viruses in China, in search of clues to the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. A team of 21 researchers from the country\u2019s leading academic institutions had trapped more than 17,000 bats, from the subtropical south to the frigid northeast, and tested them for relatives of SARS-CoV-2. The number they found: zero. The authors acknowledged this was a surprising result. But they concluded relatives of SARS-CoV-2 are \u201cextremely rare\u201d in China and suggested that to pinpoint the pandemic\u2019s roots, \u201cextensive\u201d bat surveys should take place abroad, in the Indochina Peninsula. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it for a second,\u201d says Hughes, a conservation biologist who\u2019s now at Hong Kong University. Between May 2019 and November 2020, she had done her own survey of 342 bats in the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, a branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in Yunnan province where she worked at the time. As her team reported in Cell in June 2021, it found four viruses related to SARS-CoV-2 in the garden, which is about three times the size of New York City\u2019s Central Park. The new study had sampled bats near that same location, at an abandoned mine that had yielded another close SARS-CoV-2 relative in 2013, and at other sites in nearly half of China\u2019s 31 provinces. And yet the only thing researchers found were viruses close to SARS-CoV-1, which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 decades ago. Edward Holmes, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sydney who coauthored the Cell paper with Hughes, dismisses the preprint with a single word: \u201cBullshit.\u201d Although Holmes has no evidence the team behind the study did anything underhanded, \u201cThere is a big contradiction between this study and others that needs to be explained,\u201d he says. But the paper meshed with a growing political reality in China. From the start of the pandemic, the Chinese government\u2014like many foreign researchers\u2014has vigorously rejected the idea that SARS-CoV-2 somehow originated in the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) and escaped. But over the past 2 years, it has also started to push back against what many regard as the only plausible alternative scenario: The pandemic started in China with a virus that naturally jumped from bats to an \u201cintermediate\u201d species and then to humans\u2014most likely at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan. Beijing was open to the idea at first. But today it points to myriad ways SARS-CoV-2 could have arrived in Wuhan from abroad, borne by contaminated frozen food or infected foreigners\u2014perhaps at the Military World Games in Wuhan, in October 2019\u2014or released accidentally by a U.S. military lab located more than 12,000 kilometers from Wuhan. Its goal is to avoid being blamed for the pandemic in any way, says Filippa Lentzos, a sociologist at King\u2019s College London who studies biological threats and health security. \u201cChina just doesn\u2019t want to look bad,\u201d she says. \u201cThey need to maintain an image of control and competence. And that is what goes through everything they do.\u201d Police closed the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan in January 2020, shortly after the first cluster of COVID-19 cases surfaced. Noel Celis\/AFP\/Getty Images \u25bc \u25b2 China has rejected calls for independent probes of the Wuhan Institute of Virology and dismissed the theory that SARS-CoV-2 leaked from its labs. Ng Han Guan\/AP Photo The idea of a pandemic origin outside China is preposterous to many scientists, regardless of their position on whether the virus started with a lab leak or a natural jump from animals. There\u2019s simply no way SARS-CoV-2 could have come from some foreign place to Wuhan and triggered an explosive outbreak there without first racing through humans at the site of its origin. \u201cThe idea that the pandemic didn\u2019t originate in China is inconsistent with so many other things,\u201d says Jesse Bloom, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who has argued for more intensive studies of the WIV lab accident scenario. \u201cWhen you eliminate the absurd, it\u2019s Wuhan,\u201d says virologist Gregory Towers of University College London, who leans toward a natural origin. Yet Chinese researchers have published a flurry of papers supporting their government\u2019s \u201canywhere-but-here\u201d position. Multiple studies report finding no signs of SARS-CoV-2\u2013related viruses or antibodies in bats and other wild and captive animals in China. Others offer clues that the virus hitched a ride to China on imported food or its packaging. On the flip side, Chinese researchers are not pursuing\u2014or at least not publishing\u2014obvious efforts to trace the sources of the mammals sold at the Huanan market, which could yield clues to the virus\u2019 origins. Wu Zhiqiang, a virologist at Peking Union Medical College who is the lead author of the Research Square preprint, wouldn\u2019t say whether the government vetted his study, which is still under review at a journal. But he denies that his results were influenced by Beijing, let alone cooked up to please it. \u201cWe do not represent the government or anyone else,\u201d writes Wu, who says his team is not arguing that the pandemic originated outside China. \u201cWe just stand by our data, and all our data are open access.\u201d Yet Holmes, who has close and long-standing ties with Chinese scientists, worries they have become entangled in the government\u2019s political messaging. \u201cThere\u2019s clearly an official narrative that\u2019s come down from on high that appears to be: \u2018The investigations have been completed now, and they couldn\u2019t find where it came from,\u2019\u201d Holmes says. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer China\u2019s problem\u2014this is about a problem from elsewhere.\u201d He says his collaborators in China have become increasingly guarded, wary of contradicting that narrative with their own findings and opinions. Hughes left Xishuangbanna in December 2021 after 9 years in China because it had become too difficult to continue her bat research there. Most origin-related research required government review, she says, and she also needed a green light from CAS. \u201cThe dialogue is just: \u2018We don\u2019t want it to have come from here in any form,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not a sensible way of doing science.\u201d Science attempted to discuss these issues with George Gao, who until last month headed the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) and is a lead author on several key papers about the pandemic\u2019s origins. \u201cWhat can I say?\u201d Gao texted back. \u201cBest wishes.\u201d The notion that it all began at the sprawling Huanan market in downtown Wuhan was not controversial at first. A 31 December 2019 report from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announced a cluster of 27 unexplained pneumonia cases linked to the market, which was immediately closed. Three weeks later, after a novel coronavirus had been identified as the cause, government researchers concluded in the China CDC Weekly that \u201call current evidence points to wild animals sold illegally in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.\u201d On 27 January, the official Chinese news agency Xinhua reported that 33 \u201cenvironmental samples\u201d from the market had tested positive for the virus and all but two came from areas selling wildlife. Again, the results suggested \u201cthe virus stems from wild animals on sale at the market,\u201d the article stated. That spring and summer, origin research continued apace in China, Hughes says. Her group dug into bat samples it had collected in 2019 at the Xishuangbanna gardens and discovered one of the closest relatives of SARS-CoV-2 yet found, which shared 93.3% of its genetic sequence, a finding it published in June 2020 in Current Biology. \u201cThroughout 2020, we were encouraged to do more work,\u201d Hughes says. But the Chinese government\u2019s counternarrative had started to take shape. By the end of January, published reports about the earliest cases suggested almost half had no connection to Huanan, raising doubts about its role as the outbreak\u2019s origin. The lab-leak theory had also started to circulate internationally, and before long, then\u2013U.S. President Donald Trump began blaming WIV, which had studied bat coronaviruses for 15 years, for sparking the \u201ckung flu\u201d pandemic with the \u201cChina virus.\u201d In March 2020, Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for China\u2019s foreign ministry, flipped the tables, asking whether the virus came from a U.S. Army lab at Fort Detrick in Maryland. The Chinese government also began to clamp down on interactions between origin researchers and the media. Suddenly, giving an interview required permission from the Ministry of Science and Technology. \u201cPart of that was for a good reason,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cThere was some very bad science going on, and they didn\u2019t want that to come out.\u201d The dialogue is just: \u2018We don\u2019t want it to have come from here in any form.\u2019 Alice Hughes Hong Kong University The country\u2019s new mindset colored a March 2021 report from an international team sent to China earlier in the year to study the origin of the pandemic under the auspices of the World Health Organization (WHO). The report deemed a laboratory accident \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d but ranked the frozen food scenario as \u201cpossible.\u201d A direct zoonotic spillover ranked higher, as \u201cpossible-to-likely,\u201d yet the report questioned whether the jump could have happened at the Huanan market, claiming animals that might have carried the virus weren\u2019t there. \u201cNo verified reports of live mammals being sold around 2019 were found,\u201d the report flatly stated. Dutch virologist Marion Koopmans, a prominent member of the WHO team, acknowledges politics played a role in both statements. Koopmans says she never put much stock in the frozen food route. As to the notion that mammals weren\u2019t sold at the Huanan market, she says the international scientists on the mission were \u201chighly skeptical\u201d of the claim. They even showed their Chinese counterparts a photo Holmes had taken a few years earlier at that very market that showed a caged raccoon dog\u2014a species known to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and able to transmit it. But in the end, hard evidence that the market sold mammals in 2019 was lacking, and the international scientists went along with the \u201cno verified reports\u201d phrasing, Koopmans says, to avoid \u201cthe political situation.\u201d To Chris Newman, an ecologist at the University of Oxford who has long studied the illegal sale of wildlife at Chinese markets, the report marked a significant shift in the Chinese government\u2019s strategy. \u201cThey tried to start to change the narrative, and they\u2019ve been sort of trapped in that ever since,\u201d Newman says. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to look for any alternative explanation, however implausible that might be. It\u2019s almost like being caught in a childish lie.\u201d Health officials in Taiyuan swab fish at a market in January 2021. Chinese researchers say imported frozen food has caused COVID-19 outbreaks in the country. Wei Liang\/China News Service via Getty Images \u25bc \u25b2 A bat is sampled for viruses in Thailand. China insists SARS-CoV-2 likely originated outside its borders and has advocated for more global efforts to find the virus\u2019 origin. Andre Malerba\/Bloomberg via Getty Images As it happened, Newman knew the statement about the Huanan market was dead wrong. \u201cSomebody was misleading the World Health Organization here,\u201d he says. Newman had helped conceptualize and write a study led by Zhou Zhao-Min of China West Normal University that surveyed mammals sold in Wuhan markets for 2 years prior to the pandemic, looking for the source of a tick-borne infection. It documented nearly 50,000 mammals for sale at Wuhan\u2019s animal markets, including Huanan. Among the species were raccoon dogs and civets, also highly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. The team could have published the study as a preprint, but it wanted the \u201ccredibility\u201d of a peer-reviewed paper, Newman says. That took a long time. The paper finally appeared in Scientific Reports in June 2021\u2014revealing the glaring misdirection in the WHO report published 3 months earlier. Zhou and Newman had sent a draft of their paper to WHO in October 2020, realizing its potential significance for the origins debate, but the agency had not done anything with it. \u201cThat was a big glitch,\u201d Koopmans says. \u201cI find that annoying\u2014I\u2019m putting it mildly.\u201d Zhou and the other Chinese co-author, Xiao Xiao, did not respond to repeated requests from Science for interviews about the study. \u201cWhen the paper did finally come out, they were both taken aside by their institutions and told off,\u201d Newman says. \u201cThey were told to cease all work on wildlife trade. And they were quite worried.\u201d The paper left out a key detail that might help clarify the pandemic\u2019s origin: It did not say whether the researchers collected ticks\u2014which suck mammalian blood\u2014or took biological samples directly from the animals. Either could be tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 or genetic remnants of the virus itself to find out which animal species harbored it. Newman wasn\u2019t involved with the sample collection, so he asked Zhou, but to no avail. \u201cZhou is not at liberty to say, and he doesn\u2019t reply,\u201d Newman says. \u201cIt\u2019s so self-evident that surely somebody in the Chinese CDC has done exactly that. Surely somebody knows the answer.\u201d Everyone from lab-leak proponents to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and U.S. President Joe Biden criticized the WHO report, and in its wake, China\u2019s willingness to probe the origins of the pandemic took another nosedive. The government scuttled ambitious follow-up plans proposed by the group: studies of viral genomes of the earliest cases, to trace the initial spread; retrospective analyses of Chinese hospital records prior to the outbreak and of illnesses in high-risk groups such as farmers and veterinarians; and mapping supply chains of farms that sold to the Huanan market. \u201cThe derailment of this whole process is horrible,\u201d Koopmans says. The finger-pointing at other countries also ramped up. On 17 September 2021, The Lancet published a four-page correspondence by Wu and authors at CCDC and several of the country\u2019s top academic institutions claiming the WHO committee had carried out \u201can extensive investigation in Wuhan in the past year.\u201d The letter argued it was now \u201creasonable\u201d to start a \u201cworldwide\u201d hunt for the origin and laid out a plan for doing so. Invoking the lofty rhetoric common in global health circles\u2014\u201chumankind must work together\u201d\u2014the article stressed that the massive global investigation it proposed \u201cshould be carried out by scientists on the basis of science alone, without interference or coercion from political forces.\u201d China just doesn\u2019t want to look bad. They need to maintain an image of control and competence. Filippa Lentzos King\u2019s College London By now more than two dozen reports from Chinese scientists have suggested the virus came from elsewhere. Many, including Wu\u2019s Lancet letter, explored the imported frozen food hypothesis. After China had all but stopped COVID-19 transmission by March 2020, researchers linked small outbreaks to imported salmon at a Beijing market, frozen cod offloaded at shipping docks in Qingdao, and imported pollock packaged by a company in Dalian. Other scientists tested more than 50 million swabs of frozen food packages from across China and found that nearly 1500 had genetic remnants of the virus. In the China CDC Weekly they asserted it \u201ccannot be ruled out\u201d that just such contamination triggered the initial Huanan market outbreak. Yet researchers rarely detected infectious virus on the food\u2014only viral RNA\u2014and food regulators in the United States, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand have dismissed this route of transmission. There\u2019s also nothing that connects imported frozen food at the Huanan market to the outbreak there. Besides, if the virus arrived in Wuhan on frozen food, \u201cit means the virus had to be already circulating somewhere else, and there\u2019s no evidence of that,\u201d Koopmans says. Studies from Spain, Italy, France, Brazil, and the United States have reported finding genetic pieces of the virus\u2014or antibodies to it\u2014in stored tissue from patients or wastewater samples that predate the Wuhan outbreak. Chinese scientific papers and media have made much of such findings, but skeptics say the viral traces may be contaminants and the antibodies could be responses to other pathogens that \u201ccross-react\u201d with SARS-CoV-2. As for the frozen food route, Holmes says it\u2019s not even worth discussing. \u201cYou might as well just say it came from cosmic dust.\u201d China has not allowed foreign researchers into the country to conduct independent origin studies, but that hasn\u2019t stymied all investigations. On 26 February, a large international team that included Holmes and Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona, published two preprints that offered a new analysis of the outbreak\u2019s early days\u2014and pointed directly at the Huanan market. (Science published peer-reviewed versions\u2014here and here\u2014online on 26 July.) Early reports suggesting some cases were not connected to the market mistakenly identified people as having the disease who did not, the authors contended. They combined spatial analyses of where infected people lived and worked, genetic sequencing of early viral samples, and the location of positive environmental samples and the stalls that sold mammals highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 to conclude the market was the \u201cepicenter\u201d of the pandemic. But a preprint from China published a day earlier by Gao and many co-authors from CCDC reached a starkly different conclusion. The study analyzed more than 1000 environmental samples from the Huanan market and found SARS-CoV-2 in 73 of them, indicating the virus was in the sewer, on the ground, and in \u201ccontainers,\u201d some of which Worobey suspects may have been cages that held mammals, based on their location. In a so-called metagenomic analysis, the researchers also found several samples had a blend of viral and human RNA, \u201cwhich highly suggests the SARS-CoV-2 might have derived from Homo sapiens\u201d in the market, the authors wrote. In other words, humans didn\u2019t catch SARS-CoV-2 from animals at the market. Instead, people might have brought it to the market from elsewhere. More and more clues \u2026 are pointing the origins of SARS-CoV-2 to sources around the world. Zhao Lijian Chinese foreign ministry Again, the researchers mentioned viral traces on imported frozen food and the retrospective studies from other countries as clues to a foreign origin. \u201cDefinitely, more work involving international coordination is needed to investigate the real origins of SARS-CoV-2,\u201d they concluded. Worobey and Holmes were gobsmacked by what the study didn\u2019t say. In a graphic that illustrates the metagenomic analysis, dots show the virus mixed with RNA from several species other than humans, but the preprint does not specify which species. \u201cThey ignore all the other animals in there,\u201d Holmes says. A researcher who claims to have reviewed the manuscript for Nature says it\u2019s not clear whether the omission was intentional or due to sloppy science, but either way, \u201cI said you cannot publish this unless they release the raw data.\u201d The reviewer, who asked not to be named, noted that the paper also includes an analysis of a sample from a defeathering machine at the market that found only human DNA. \u201cEither only humans were defeathered or the analysis was wrong\u2014pick your favorite,\u201d the reviewer says. Gao did not reply to Science\u2019s specific request to discuss the metagenomic data. In an attempt to reboot the origin probe, WHO last year created the Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO), a new international team of 26 people. SAGO\u2019s preliminary report, issued on 15 May, offers recommendations echoing those of the earlier team, with two major differences: It calls for more studies of a potential \u201claboratory incident\u201d\u2014although members from China, Russia, and Brazil dissented\u2014and it recognizes that the Huanan market did sell mammals susceptible to the virus. But by then, \u201canywhere but here\u201d had become the Chinese government\u2019s party line. \u201cMore and more clues from the international science community are pointing the origins of SARS-CoV-2 to sources around the world,\u201d Zhao, the foreign press ministry spokesperson, asserted at a 10 June press conference in response to the SAGO report. He again brought up the controversial reports of very early cases outside China and called for investigations at the \u201chighly suspicious\u201d Fort Detrick laboratory. Wu says many Chinese researchers remain open to the idea that the virus originated in China. \u201cWe have never ruled out Wuhan or China in the next phase of the investigation, and Chinese researchers are still working on it and continuously getting data,\u201d he says. He stresses that, in response to peer reviewers, his team has \u201ctoned down\u201d some of its bold assertions in the Research Square preprint about the bat survey in China. For example, instead of calling viruses related to SARS-CoV-2 in Chinese bats \u201cextremely rare,\u201d the manuscript now says they \u201cmight be rare.\u201d But the clampdown on bat research that Hughes experienced has continued, especially at the local level, says Aaron Irving, a bat researcher at Zhejiang University. \u201cPeople are now often scared to help out bat researchers in case they also get in trouble,\u201d he says. Irving stresses that his institution still supports his work, as do the local and provincial authorities, but what he calls \u201cnonscientific interference\u201d has taken a toll. \u201cEveryone in the bat field got a little secretive and protective too because they don\u2019t want to be targeted.\u201d Some researchers think too much time has passed to solve the origin mystery. But others who favor a natural origin say they only need a few more jigsaw pieces to complete the puzzle. Newman suspects Chinese officials and researchers may already hold some of those pieces. \u201cThey should be in a position to know an awful lot more than we are currently told,\u201d he says. There is no shame in admitting that the virus came from wild animals illegally sold at a market, Newman adds. \u201cTo leave it as an open question, it\u2019s just going to breed intrigue about why the Chinese have not given us a clear explanation,\u201d Newman says. \u201cWhy the smoke and mirrors? Whereas if they come up with something that we could all just accept, well, then it will be case closed. Can\u2019t we persuade them that this is the right thing for everybody to do?\u201d",

Now entering its third year, COVID-19 and the economic toll it has taken is still being figured out by researchers and health policy experts who hope to provide evidence of vaccine rollouts and get ahead of new variants of the virus. The cost of COVID-19 in lives lost, medical expenses, and economic impact has been severe. It has killed an estimated 15 million people worldwide, and 4 million Americans are living with the lasting symptoms known as long COVID. One article even dubbed it \u201cthe $16 Trillion Virus.\u201d Vaccination has been known as the most successful health strategy for the prevention of infectious diseases and their subsequent disability conditions. Yet equal access to vaccines and aggressive antiscience sentiment remain as hurdles. The Texas Children\u2019s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development developed a low-cost, patent-free recombinant protein COVID-19 \u201cpeople\u2019s vaccine\u201d (CORBEVAX) that has been administered to more than 70 million adolescents and children in India and was just approved in Botswana. In the United States, substantial progress has been made in vaccinating the population against COVID-19, with the important exception of an estimated 200,000 unvaccinated Americans who lost their lives because they refused COVID-19 vaccinations. Antivaccine defiance has evolved over the last 20 years, starting with disinformation about vaccines causing autism but now culminating around a framework of health or medical freedom that has started to globalize to Canada, Western Europe, and increasingly to low- and middle-income countries. This sentiment targets both biomedical science and scientists with dangerous consequences for the nation but also for worldwide vaccinations and other health and science interventions. During this webinar, viewers will: Learn about the impact of neglected tropical diseases and COVID-19 among unvaccinated populations in the United States and globally Gain insight into the origins of rising antivaccine sentiment, its recent shifts, and approaches to countering antivaccine activities Discover how recombinant DNA technology is used and plays a vital role in vaccine development Have the opportunity to ask questions during the live broadcast.

        "text":"Share on Pinterest Pat Greenhouse\/The Boston Globe via Getty Images The new COVID-19 booster campaign will include shots that also target the Omicron virus variants. The Food and Drug Administration authorized on Aug. 31 updated boosters for Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech. The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will need to sign off on the updated boosters before they can be rolled out to the public. With the country\u2019s third \u201cCOVID fall\u201d approaching, the United States is expected to start ramping up its autumn COVID-19 booster campaign \u2014 with something new in store for this year. On Aug. 31, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of bivalent boosters that include both the original vaccine formula and a component that targets the currently circulating Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the coronavirus. This is the first updated COVID-19 vaccine to be authorized in the United States. Next, an advisory committee to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will meet Sept. 1 to make recommendations on which groups should receive these updated boosters. The CDC director will also need to sign off on the boosters before they can be rolled out to the public. Once this happens, the updated boosters could be available to the public in early to mid-September. Why are booster doses needed? The Omicron variant has overcome much of the protection against infection offered by two doses of the mRNA vaccines (such as Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech). A first booster restores some of that protection, but this wanes considerably within about three months after vaccination. In spite of that, Dr. David Cutler, a family medicine physician at Providence Saint John\u2019s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., told Healthline that the current vaccines continue to offer strong protection against severe illness and death. This is especially true of the boosters. In June 2022, unvaccinated people were five times more likely to die of COVID-19, compared to people vaccinated with at least a primary series (for most, two doses of the mRNA vaccines), according to the CDC. Among people 50 years and older, unvaccinated people were 14 times more likely to die of COVID-19 than those who had received the primary series and at least two booster doses, agency data showed. When will Omicron-specific boosters be available? The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech boosters based on the original strain of the coronavirus are currently available for anyone who is eligible now for a first or second booster. The bivalent boosters from those companies are expected to be available in early to mid-September, Dr. Ashish Jha, White House COVID-19 response team coordinator, said in a virtual discussion with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation on August 16. The fourth vaccine in the country, Novavax\u2019s protein-based vaccine, was authorized by the FDA on July 13, 2022 for use as a two-dose primary series . This vaccine is based on the original strain of the coronavirus. The company announced the next month that it had applied for FDA authorization of this vaccine as a booster. It is also testing an Omicron-specific vaccine and a bivalent vaccine that targets Omicron and the original strain, the company said in a release. Who will be eligible this booster? Everyone currently eligible for a COVID-19 booster will still be eligible for these boosters, including: First booster: everyone ages 5 years and older who has completed their primary series Second booster: adults ages 50 years and older; and some people ages 12 years and older who are moderately or severely immunocompromised Johannes said anyone at risk of severe COVID-19, or complications of a coronavirus infection, should consider getting boosted when the bivalent vaccine is available. This includes older adults, as well as those with chronic medical conditions such as heart disease, liver or kidney disease, a chronic respiratory condition, cancer, an immune compromising condition, high blood pressure or diabetes. The Biden administration is also expected to open up second boosters this fall to adults under age 50 when the bivalent vaccines are available. This expansion of eligibility was put on hold when vaccine makers said they could deliver the bivalent vaccines in early fall. When the bivalent boosters are available, the following people will be eligible to receive them: Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent booster: People 12 years of age and older, at least 2 months after completing the primary series or receiving a booster dose with the original vaccine Moderna bivalent booster: People 18 years of age and older, at least 2 months after completing the primary series or receiving a booster dose with the original vaccine The original vaccines will continue be used as the primary series for people 6 months of age and older, the FDA said in a statement when it authorized the updated vaccines. In addition, the original Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will continue to be used as a booster dose for people 5 through 11 years of age. It should be noted that pregnant women are still eligible for boosters, as well as the primary series. \u201cThe [COVID-19 mRNA] vaccines have now been given to tens of millions of pregnant women. They are extremely safe,\u201d said Jha during the online Chamber of Commerce call. \u201cWe have seen little to no side effects [in pregnant women], the same side effects that most of us get \u2014 the sore arm, sometimes 24 hours of feeling fatigued or a little bit run down.\u201d Bolstering the safety profile of these vaccines, a large study from Canada published August 17, 2022, in The BMJ found that women who received a COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy did not have a higher risk of having a preterm birth, a baby who was small for their gestational age at birth, or a stillbirth. Vaccines are likely to mainly be available at doctors\u2019 offices and pharmacies. Some mass vaccinations may also happen in certain locations. To find a vaccination site near you, check out the federal Vaccines.gov or your state\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine website. When should I get boosted? It\u2019s difficult to know what the coronavirus will do in the fall \u2014 will there be a large spike early in September or will a new variant emerge? As a result, the CDC recommends getting boosted as soon as you are eligible , with whichever booster is available. This is especially important for adults 50 years and older or those with compromised immune systems. It can take one to two weeks after receiving a booster for your immune system to be fully primed. So if you are eligible now and get boosted, you will be better protected should cases surge as we head into the fall and winter. You can always get the bivalent vaccine when it is available. Jha said you will want to space out those two boosters \u201cat least a little bit, probably 4 to 8 weeks.\u201d The CDC may also weigh in on the timing between boosters when it reviews the data on the Omicron-specific boosters.",

        "text":"Dementia causes a progressive loss of a person\u2019s cognitive abilities, which are crucial for everyday functioning. When someone has dementia, they may have trouble with memory, thinking, reasoning, or even language. Losing these skills can make it difficult for people with dementia to perform their day-to-day activities. While there\u2019s no cure for dementia, some treatment options can help alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. For example, people often discuss the idea of using memory games for dementia that can help stimulate the brain. But what does the research actually say about the role of brain stimulating games for dementia? In this article, we explore how brain games might help with cognitive functions, and the best games to play. How can brain games help people with dementia? Games are among the many activities that can keep the human mind entertained and engaged. But more importantly, games can help keep our brains stimulated. This is extremely important for older adults, especially those at risk of dementia. For example, a 2019 study that included older adults explored the impact of 16 weeks of combined physical and cognitive \u201cexergame\u201d training. The researchers found that there was significant improvement of working memory and executive function. A 2019 study researched the effect of computerized cognitive training (in areas such as reasoning, memory, language, and attention) on the progression of mild cognitive impairment. Results of the study showed that the training increased the brain\u2019s gray matter volume and may help preserve general cognition. So, what do these studies have to do with brain games for dementia? When someone has dementia, many of their cognitive skills are declining. These include some of the skills mentioned in these studies, such as memory and reasoning. And newer research has suggested that gaming may help improve these cognitive skills, especially in people with dementia. Recently, one review from 2020 explored research on the role of serious games for dementia care. During the review, the researchers explored three types of games and their benefits: Board games: These can help with cognitive functions such as memory, communication, and emotional regulation. These can help with cognitive functions such as memory, communication, and emotional regulation. Video games: Video games can be customized to directly target different cognitive abilities, such as memory and reasoning. Video games can be customized to directly target different cognitive abilities, such as memory and reasoning. Virtual reality games: These can provide both cognitive and physical reinforcement, depending on the type of game. According to the review, when early stage and middle stage patients with dementia used serious games, they were able to improve a wide variety of cognitive abilities, including: short-term memory reaction time problem solving logical reasoning communication Still, despite a fair amount of supportive evidence for the role of games in dementia care, the literature is still relatively mixed. For example, a more recent analysis on the research surrounding brain games and cognitive impairment found that brain games weren\u2019t more effective for improving cognitive function than control interventions. Ultimately, while there\u2019s some promise for the role of brain stimulating games for dementia, more research is needed. What are the best games to play for dementia? We\u2019ve known for decades now that games can be a great way to stimulate the brain. However, not all games are created equal when it comes to which skills they can train. So, here are some of the games that may support a wide variety of cognitive skills, especially for people with dementia. Word puzzles Word puzzles are a genre of games that focus specifically on language. Some games like Scrabble focus on letter and word arrangement, while other games like crosswords focus on word recall. However, there are a wide variety of forms that word puzzles can take, such as the recently released Wordle. Research from 2015 suggests that playing games like crosswords puzzles, among other types of puzzles, may potentially lead to cognitive improvements in verbal learning, memory, speed, and more. With this in mind, consider giving some of these classic word puzzles a try: crosswords word searches anagrams cryptograms branded games such as Scrabble and Mad Libs Jigsaw puzzles Jigsaw puzzles are a type of puzzle game that are particularly beneficial for memory and reasoning. Jigsaw puzzles can range from simple puzzles that are easy to piece together to more complex puzzles that require a lot more hand-eye coordination and memory recall. Because people with dementia often struggle with cognitive skills such as memory recall and reasoning, jigsaw puzzles may be an easy way to support these skills. And the best part about these puzzles is that there\u2019s a little something for everyone, from simple cardboard jigsaws to three-dimensional jigsaw sculptures and much more. Dice games There\u2019s a central component of luck in a lot of dice games. Most rely on a random throw of the dice. This makes games like Yahtzee and Bar Dice extra fun and competitive. Older research from 2012 suggests that people with certain types of cognitive conditions, such as dementia, may experience a decrease in numerical and calculation skills. These skills can be practiced with dice games. Here are some brain-simulating dice games that you can add to your repertoire: Backgammon Kismet Liar\u2019s dice Shut the Box Yahtzee Card games Card games rely on different types of playing cards to play. Card games can either use a standard deck of cards, like Rummy, or cards that are specific to the game, like Uno. Card games are great for practicing skills such as reasoning, problem solving, memory, and concentration: the same skills which are often in decline in individuals with dementia. With a wide variety of card games on the market, it can be hard to figure out where to start, so here are a few to get you started: matching games, such as Go Fish trick-taking games, such as Bridge specific games, such as Uno Solitaire variations collectible games, such as the Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game Board games Board games are a genre of games that use a premade board, along with pieces, which are moved or placed on the board. Most board games, especially newer ones, also use cards, dice, and other elements. A 2019 study that explored the benefits of playing analog games, such as board games, among 1,091 participants found that a higher frequency of playing games resulted in less cognitive decline from age 70 to age 79. Considering the impact that board games may have on cognitive health, here are a few suggestions to add to your collection: Monopoly Trivial Pursuit Ticket to Ride Cranium Chess Video games Video games encompass a wide variety of electronic games, from traditional desktop computer games to games on newer systems like the Wii and Switch. And let\u2019s not forget cell phone and tablet games, which are rising in popularity among older adults especially. Recent research supports the theory that specifically designed brain training games may enhance cognitive functioning in older adults, especially in areas such as visual recognition, visual memory, and attention. If you\u2019ve never played video games before but are considering giving them a try, here are some good options to start with: TETRIS on any platform Candy Crush Saga, online or on mobile Animal Crossing: New Horizons on the Nintendo Switch Wii Sports on the Nintendo Wii (it\u2019s great for exercise too) any mobile or app version of the classics, like word games, puzzles, card or dice games, and board games Free games to play on your cell phone Whether you\u2019re a casual card gamer or a board game buff, everyone can appreciate a little freebie. Here are a few of our favorite games that you can try for free today: Blackbox \u2013 Brain Puzzles for iPhone for iPhone Scrabble GO for iPhone and Android for iPhone and Android Words with Friends for iPhone and Android for iPhone and Android Wordle on the New York Times website on the New York Times website Candy Crush Saga for iPhone and Android for iPhone and Android Cookie Run: Kingdom for iPhone and Android What other activities can help people with dementia? Games aren\u2019t the only activities that can help support cognitive function in people with dementia. According to the experts at Dementia Australia, other activities that can be helpful include: Reading: Reading is a wonderfully enriching activity that doesn\u2019t just involve books. You can also read poetry, magazines, newspapers, comics, and other printed or online content. Reading is a wonderfully enriching activity that doesn\u2019t just involve books.

Learning: Learning new things, whether through a class, YouTube videos, podcasts, or other mediums, is a great way to reinforce cognitive skills in older age. Some people with severe dementia may struggle to do even simple tasks, so some of the activities mentioned above may be difficult for them to engage in. If this is the case, consider sticking to simpler activities, like chatting and reminiscing, looking through pictures, and listening to music. Frequently asked questions about games for dementia Should you play games by yourself or with another person, or does it matter? While the research doesn\u2019t say whether solo or multiperson games are better for dementia, we do know that different types of games offer different cognitive benefits. For example, crossword puzzles are generally played alone and can be great for language and attention. But board games can also enhance these skills, and playing with others provides socialization and communication skills. Can brain games prevent or delay dementia if you start them early in life? According to the National Institute on Aging (NIA), nothing has been scientifically proven to prevent or treat dementia. However, there are certain lifestyle changes that you can make to reduce your risk. This includes staying cognitively active and socializing with family and friends, both of which brain games can help you do. Who is most at risk of dementia, and is there anything that can prevent this condition? Science shows that the biggest risk factors for dementia are two things we can\u2019t control: our age and our genetics. Aging is the biggest risk factor for developing dementia, and that risk doubles every 5 years starting at around age 70. While certain lifestyle changes can reduce your risk of dementia, no approach has been shown to prevent it entirely. Are there any medical treatments that can cure dementia once it\u2019s developed? According to the National Health Service (NHS), there\u2019s no cure for dementia. But certain medications, cognitive treatments (such as cognitive stimulation therapy), and other lifestyle therapies may help manage some of the symptoms and possibly slow down the progression of the disease in certain people.",

        "text":"In February, the editor-in-chief of Food and Chemical Toxicology published an editorial calling for \u201cPapers on potential toxic effects of COVID-19 vaccines.\u201d Following this call, in April 2022, the journal \u2013 no stranger to Retraction Watch readers \u2013 published an article titled \u201cInnate immune suppression by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinations: The role of G-quadruplexes, exosomes, and MicroRNAs.\u201d At more than 16,000 words and more than 200 references, the article was submitted on February 9th and accepted on April 8th. It claims that \u201cbillions of lives are potentially at risk\u201d with Covid-19 vaccines. Such an important statement should be supported by facts. But this is not at all the case. And yet the paper has been shared more than 45,000 times on social media, in ways that decrease trust in science and the COVID-19 vaccine, despite the robust evidence that it is both safe and efficient. We submitted a letter to the editor to highlight major flaws and obvious shortcomings in the article including several misunderstandings of the provided bibliography. In this letter, preprinted on OSF, we asked for the retraction of the article and thoroughly detailed all of the issues we found in the paper which, combined, severely undermine the authors\u2019 conclusions. Our letter consists of a table collecting several instances where the authors misused previous literature as well as an explanation of why their claims based on the reference they used were wrong. For instance, the authors argue, against all available evidence, that the vaccination \u201cinduces a profound impairment of Type I interferon signaling which has various adverse consequences to human health.\u201d They further rely on the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which cannot establish causation and is comprised of self-reports, not checked for accuracy. This letter was read by four reviewers whose names were unknown to us. Three initially recommended against publishing it. Reviewer 1 argued there was no reason for retraction because \u201cthere is no evidence of scientific fraud that justifies the demand for retraction of the original submission.\u201d They also claimed that \u201cThe main focus of their allegation is based on the size of the review article and the average time period for a journal to evaluate a submission for publication.\u201d Reviewer 2 initially stated that \u201cthe authors point out some issues which are relevant,\u201d but did not think the paper should be retracted. They found our letter \u201csomewhat offensive.\u201d No need for the original paper to be somewhat accurate, this reviewer argued, since \u201cThis is a review, so conjecture is allowed, if dis-proven it is fine.\u201d They went on: \u201cI recognize some are using this to feed falsehoods in social media, but that\u2019s not the responsibility of FCT [the publishing journal] to monitor.\u201d Reviewer 3 made more constructive remarks and gave us feedback for the letter to be published. They advised us to soften our overall tone. Reviewer 4 made some astonishing claims such as \u201cthe letter starts with some statements concerning the reviewing process (lengths of the manuscript, duration of the evaluation period) which are largely irrelevant (as they are not directly related to mistakes in the article).\u201d Reviewer 4 further directly states that the editor had reasons to want the Seneff et al. article published fast. Reading this, one could wonder what the peer-reviewing process is made for if not detecting mistakes in the manuscript. They questioned our experience and previous work, going even as far as to check our resum\u00e9s: \u201cNone of the authors of the LTE [letter to the editor] is obviously experienced in editing top quality scientific journals\u201d and \u201cIn this context it is notable that I noticed that the first author of the LTE has published only two full length articles in international scientific journals which concern immune response towards mRNA and other vaccines (as well as several short letters, editorial remarks, and a review). Also other coauthors seem to have only limited experience in the area.\u201d We found the inclusion of those comments \u2013 which presumably had been read by the editor in chief \u2013 unacceptable. The merits of a submission should stand on their own, regardless of the expertise of the authors. We found it particularly ironic, given that no such background check seems to have been done on the authors of the original paper. Indeed, the authors of the original article are a computer scientist who often publishes controversial papers in low-impact journals on biology and medical topics, a naturopath, a microbiologist, and a cardiologist. Our team includes two oncologists who would appear to be particularly relevant considering the original claims that \u201cthere will be billions of cancers due to Covid-19 vaccines.\u201d The editor in chief suggested we revise our letter to take their comments into account. Despite removing our comment on what we found to be a surprisingly short time between the call for papers and the submission of the manuscript, Reviewer 2 still saw this as a reason to reject our letter at round 2, raising concerns on whether our revision had been considered. Reviewer 2 also stood their ground and said the letter should be rejected despite the fact that we had softened our demand for retraction to a suggestion. And Reviewer 4, despite acknowledging that we \u201cinserted some corrections in the revised version which [they] suggested,\u201d recommended our letter to be rejected because the table analyzing the bibliographics errors of the original manuscripts did not seem clear to them. Our letter was then, unsurprisingly, rejected by the editor in chief of Food and Chemical Toxicology. So its influence continues to spread, even mentioned by Fox News host Tucker Carlson to argue \u2013 inaccurately \u2013 that the vaccine can harm your immune system. Let us be clear: misunderstanding and misusing the literature, making unsupported claims, and distorting facts is not opening a scientific debate. We will not give up, and we will find other ways of publishing our retraction demand. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Barriere is a medical oncologist at Polyclinique Saint-Jean in Cagnes-sur-Mer, France.

        "text":"via CDC We\u2019ve been tracking retractions of papers about COVID-19 as part of our database. Here\u2019s a running list, which will be updated as needed. (For some context on these figures, see this post, our letter in Accountability in Research and the last section of this Nature news article. Also see a note about the terminology regarding preprint servers at the end.) Retracted Expressions of concern Note: Retraction Watch does not draw a distinction between withdrawal and retraction, because journals that have done so have typically done it to justify not saying anything about why a paper was retracted, and to sometimes make a paper disappear without a trace. Richard Sever, co-founder of bioRxiv and medRxiv, asked that we include a comment from him about how the processes for withdrawing preprints and retracting journal articles may differ: Journals may retract a paper at the authors\u2019 request and\/or if the editors identify fundamental flaws that would have precluded acceptance if spotted during review. [RW: Note that some journals insist that they cannot make such moves without authors\u2019 permission.] A preprint is usually withdrawn only at an authors\u2019 request. A preprint server will not typically withdraw a flawed preprint against the wishes of the author, since the server made no claim to have peer-reviewed and certified the scientific content in the first place. At the same time, preprint servers *will* withdraw a preprint against the authors\u2019 wishes in instances of fraud, ethics violations, dangerous material, or legal issues. It is thus the nature of preprints that there will be some that contain errors but are not withdrawn and would not appear in the above list. [RW: The same is, of course, true of some papers in peer-reviewed journals.] Like Retraction Watch?

        "title":"Ensuring Equitable Access to Health Care for Our Communities We\\'re developing new ways to reach all populations with specific consideration for vulnerable ones to provide access to essential COVID-19 information and services.",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.hopkinsmedicine.org\/coronavirus\/equity\/ensuring-equitable-access.html",
        "text":"Published May 24, 2021 Johns Hopkins Medicine is dedicated to providing equitable care to all Caring for neighboring communities is essential to the mission of Johns Hopkins Medicine (JHM). During the COVID-19 pandemic, JHM has strived to stay at the forefront of continuous changes in medicine and care options as they evolve, including by providing testing for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, performing best practices to prevent the spread of illness, and offering innovative therapies, emotional support resources, language access options and, now, COVID-19 vaccines. As the COVID-19 pandemic has made health disparities even more apparent, JHM knows that providing equitable access to care is incredibly important. As part of this effort, Johns Hopkins Medicine continues to develop new ways to offer access to information and services for all populations with a focus on those that are most vulnerable to the worst effects of the illness. It is important to meet community members where they live and to ensure that everyone who wants a vaccine can get one when supply is available. \u201cWe need to make sure we continuously remove barriers that impede access to care, many of which have existed long before COVID-19, so everyone can get a vaccine,\u201d says Sherita Golden M.D., M.H.S. \u201cJHM is committed to building the trust of our community by collaborating with partnering organizations to reach populations that may not have the information they need about vaccines and the options available to them. Many people want to know what their pastor and neighbors think about the vaccine, and we need to work with our communities\u2019 trusted messengers and arm them with information to help their communities.\u201d Initially, vaccine supply was extremely limited, and JHM had very little insight regarding how much vaccine it would receive on a weekly basis from the government. Considering these challenges, Johns Hopkins took a methodical approach to rolling out COVID-19 vaccine to communities. As the pandemic progresses and government agencies continue to open COVID-19 vaccine eligibility to certain demographic groups, Johns Hopkins Medicine remains committed to providing services for its community and information about COVID-19 developments access to care. Johns Hopkins Medicine has various partnerships and programs to reach its neighbors in nearby communities. For example, Maryland and Washington, D.C., providers collaborate with local governments to help vaccinate groups such as public-school employees. JHM is also going on-site to housing facilities for older people in Baltimore and Washington to vaccinate highly vulnerable residents in the comfort of their living spaces, which helps break down transportation challenges for those with mobility issues. While mass vaccination options grow, many community members are best served by a community vaccination clinic due to language barriers and health and transportation challenges. Johns Hopkins Medicine is conducting comprehensive vaccination clinics across Baltimore and Washington, in partnership with a variety of faith-based and homeless advocacy organizations, to equitably provide COVID-19 vaccines to the most vulnerable populations. JHM is also working closely with Latino community organizations, such as the Esperanza Center and Centro SOL, to make sure everyone who wants a vaccine can receive one without communication barriers. \u201cWe know communities of color are being disproportionally impacted by COVID-19, \u201csays Katie O\u2019Conor, M.D., operations chief for Johns Hopkins Medicine\u2019s unified command. \u201cThat\u2019s why it is so important that we bring the vaccine to people in the neighborhoods where they live, and work with trusted community leaders to offer this as a welcoming option in a place where people feel safe and surrounded by their communities.\u201d A key barrier to seeking care is limited access to critical information. JHM has developed informative materials that are easily understandable by neighbors on all reading levels, translated them into several languages and distributed them among various communities. JHM also offers language access services, and printed materials and toolkits \u2014 particularly for vulnerable communities without access to digital communication. Another important collaboration is with Mary\u2019s Center that serves more than 60,000 minority community members. Over the next few months, JHM will connect this community with Johns Hopkins experts through Facebook, radio and television, so that health questions can be submitted by phone or mobile device and answered in real time. Mary\u2019s Center also connects its members to JHM Espanol, the Johns Hopkins Medicine Spanish language portal, through its web homepage. JHM has developed a new data tool \u2014 a vaccine prioritization dashboard \u2014 that helps people with disabilities determine when they qualify for the COVID-19 vaccine. The website, designed and run by researchers, students, and advocates for people with disabilities, aims not only to help the disabled community be informed and get vaccinated, but also to arm policymakers with data that can aid them in improving the health care system. JHM collaboration spans community partners as well as fellow health care systems. Johns Hopkins is working with the state of Maryland and the University of Maryland Medical System to provide care at the Baltimore Convention Center field hospital. This care site, which was quickly mobilized very early in JHM\u2019s pandemic response, is the city\u2019s longest continually operating field hospital that offers COVID-19 testing, monoclonal antibody infusion therapy and vaccinations, as well as clinical care outside of a traditional hospital setting. \u201cIt is critical to us to collaborate and use all the resources available to educate and reach all people about the dangers of COVID-19 and the importance of the vaccine,\u201d says Gabor Kelen, M.D., director of the Johns Hopkins Office of Critical Event Preparedness and Response. \u201cDiversity and equity are among our core values, and it is our responsibility to ensure we reach every member of the community in any way we can, to provide equitable access to health care and hope for the end of this pandemic.\u201d Johns Hopkins Medicine will continue to do everything possible to ensure that those who want and can get a COVID-19 vaccine have the opportunity to do so. Importantly, JHM wants to help reach people who don\u2019t have the information they need to make a decision about getting the vaccine. It is JHM\u2019s mission and privilege to serve its communities equitably and compassionately.

New ones might pop up and stick around for months. People suffering from long COVID are unwillingly in it for the long haul \u2014 and it\u2019s still unclear who\u2019s at the highest risk for the condition. Researchers don\u2019t yet have an official definition for long COVID, and its symptoms are wide-ranging (SN: 7\/29\/22). Some people struggle with extreme fatigue that interferes with their daily lives. Others can\u2019t concentrate or struggle with memory amid thick brain fog. Still others have organ damage or a persistent cough and difficulty breathing.

It\u2019s not just the one thing,\u201d says Leora Horwitz, an internal medicine physician at New York University Langone Health. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes it so hard to study.\u201d This spectrum of symptoms makes pinning down who\u2019s at high risk for long-term health problems from the disease especially hard. Some post-COVID conditions may stem from virus-induced damage or from the stress of being hospitalized with severe disease. In other cases, the body\u2019s own immune response to the virus could drive the damage. Or the virus may be hiding somewhere in the body, possibly the gut, helping symptoms to persist (SN: 11\/24\/20). Different causes may have different risk groups, says Hannah Davis, cofounder of the Patient-Led Research Collaborative, a research and advocacy group studying long COVID. There are some broad hints about who\u2019s at risk. Studies suggest that women are more likely than men to have lingering symptoms. COVID-19 patients with more than five symptoms in the first week of infection or preexisting health conditions such as asthma may be more likely to develop long COVID. Age also appears to be a risk factor, though results are mixed regarding whether the burden falls on older people or middle-aged people. Populations that were disproportionally hit by COVID-19 overall \u2014 including Black and Hispanic people \u2014 may similarly face disparities for long COVID. And while vaccination seems to protect people from developing long COVID, Horwitz says, it\u2019s still unclear by how much. Age is a risk factor for severe COVID-19, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists more than 30 health problems, including cancer and lung disease, that also raise the risk. \u201cSo many researchers assume that those [risk factors] will be the same for long COVID and there\u2019s no scientific basis for that,\u201d Davis says. There are many more that researchers could be missing when it comes to long COVID. Using health records and exams, and knowledge of ailments with symptoms similar to long COVID, experts are on the hunt for those risk factors. Examining health When it comes to getting a better handle on who\u2019s at risk for long COVID \u2014 which also goes by the wonky alias Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection \u2014 electronic health records may hold important clues. Horwitz is part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health\u2019s RECOVER initiative that aims to understand the long-term impacts of COVID-19. One arm of the study involves mining millions of electronic health records to find potential patterns. Studying millions of these records should pinpoint potential risk factors that are rare in the population overall but perhaps more common for people with long COVID, Horwitz says. \u201cThat\u2019s hard even in a cohort study of thousands.\u201d But health records aren\u2019t perfect: They depend on physicians logging that patients are having trouble sleeping or focusing, or that they\u2019re exhausted. \u201cThe things people are complaining about, we\u2019re really bad at writing down those diagnoses on the record,\u201d Horwitz says. \u201cSo we miss that.\u201d To account for health records\u2019 deficiencies, Horwitz and colleagues are also directly studying thousands of people. Participants answer a questionnaire every three months so that the team can identify what kinds of symptoms people have and whether they\u2019re getting better or worse. Then blood, urine, stool and saliva samples can reveal what\u2019s happening in the body. Tests on those samples can uncover if the coronavirus is still around and causing trouble, or if the immune system has learned to attack the body itself. Participants with abnormal test results will undergo additional, targeted testing. \u201cUnlike electronic health records where it\u2019s hit or miss, like somebody might have had a CAT scan or might not, here we say, \u2018OK, you have trouble breathing. We will take a look at your lungs,\u2019\u201d Horwitz says. The study includes a range of participants: adults and kids, pregnant people, those currently with COVID-19 and people who died after having the disease. Some of the potential risk factors that the team is looking for include autoimmune diseases and other viral infections. The list may grow as more people join the study. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to balance the fishing versus making sure that we\u2019re at least fishing for things that could be in the water,\u201d Horwitz says. Among short supply, though, are people who never caught the virus \u2014 important \u201ccontrols\u201d to highlight what\u2019s different about people who got COVID-19. So far, more than 7,000 people have signed up, and the group plans to recruit around 10,000 more. It\u2019s a lot of data, but early results may soon start coming in. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably try to do an interim peek at those data this fall,\u201d Horwitz says. \u201cIt\u2019s tricky because we deliberately wanted to enroll 18,000 people so we would have enough power to really look at the things we care about. I don\u2019t want to cheat and look too early, but we also know that there\u2019s a lot of interest.\u201d Striking similarities Some long COVID symptoms \u2014 brain fog, fatigue and trouble sleeping \u2014 mirror another illness: myalgic encephalomyelitis\/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME\/CFS. Other long COVID symptoms, such as rapid heartbeat and dizziness, fall in the category of nervous system disorders called dysautonomia. Similar symptoms could belie similar risk factors. Yet potential risk factors for those conditions are largely missing from long COVID research, says Davis, who has had long COVID since March 2020. Among the possibilities that scientists are considering are things like Epstein-Barr virus, migraines and some autoimmune diseases. Epstein-Barr virus could be a big one, Davis says. Infections last a lifetime because the virus can go into hiding in the body and possibly reemerge. That virus has been linked to ME\/CFS for decades, though its role in the disease remains unclear, Davis says. Researchers are exploring whether Epstein-Barr virus infections (shown in this transmission electron microscope image) may be linked to long COVID. Dr. Fred Murphy\/CDC Some early hints of a link between Epstein-Barr virus and long COVID already exist. Multiple studies have found evidence in blood samples from some long COVID patients that the immune system recently battled with Epstein-Barr virus, which can cause infectious mononucleosis, a disease characterized by extreme fatigue. Other studies have found signs of the virus itself. And in 2021, Davis and colleagues found that 40 out of 580 people with symptoms of long COVID who responded to an online survey reported having a current or recent Epstein-Barr virus infection. With ME\/CFS, it\u2019s possible that another illness caused by a different virus triggers the Epstein-Barr virus, which then causes the fatigue syndrome. Given the parallels between that condition and long COVID, some scientists are wondering if the two are actually the same disease, with the coronavirus now known as one trigger. Examining health conditions that raise the chances of long COVID could provide answers for both diseases, says Nancy Klimas, an immunologist at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. That\u2019s in part because researchers can more easily identify people who developed lingering symptoms after a bout of COVID-19 compared with unknown infections that may precede ME\/CFS. Also, \u201cthere\u2019s a huge difference in these two fields and it\u2019s money,\u201d Klimas says. She now has funding from the CDC to compare long COVID patients with people who have ME\/CFS. The team hopes that physical exams and specialized tests will reveal whether the two diseases are indeed the same and be a step toward understanding the mechanisms behind the lingering symptoms. Still, since long COVID as a whole encompasses such a wide range of symptoms, it will take time to uncover who is at risk of what. If COVID-19 were just one disease impacting the lungs, heart or brain, the research might be easier, Horwitz says. \u201cBut we have to test everything.\u201d",

Though the live-broadcast meeting did not weigh any regulation decision nor tailor its agenda to any single vaccine candidate or company, it provided the public a glimpse into the mindset of the FDA\u2019s key experts weeks prior to anticipated Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) applications for COVID-19 vaccines. The advisory committee meeting also allowed for community-based input\u2014of which there was plenty, as advocacy and health organizations alike represented differing patient populations, issues in disparity, and calls for scrutinous, transparent regulation of any possible vaccines. In this week\u2019s episode of Vaccine Race, Donald Alcendor, PhD, rejoined the limited series to give real-time takeaways from the VRBPAC meeting and what discussion could implicate for COVID-19 vaccine regulation. Among topics, the expert from Maharry Medical College and Vanderbilt University School of Medicine provided perspective on secondary phase 3 assessment endpoints, mandated vaccination groups, pediatric treatment arms, and advocacy representation at the meeting. With the news of remdesivir\u2019s FDA approval for the treatment of adult and children hospitalized with COVID-19 breaking a day prior, Alcendor also discussed what the decision could mean for eventual vaccine authorization.",

        "link":"https:\/\/contagionlive.com\/view\/antiviral-authorized-against-covid-19-during-delta-demonstrates-effectiveness-against-omicron",
        "text":"The oral antiviral nirmatrelvir\/ritonavir (Paxlovid) significantly lowered rates of hospitalization and death due to COVID-19 in patients 65 years of age and older, in a retrospective cohort study of a population with infections from the Omicron variant. The antiviral had received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA to reduce risk of severe COVID-19 in those with mild to moderate symptoms and risk for disease progression in December 2021 based on trials conducted during a wave of infection with the Delta variant. The current study was conducted in Israel between January 9 and March 31, 2022, when Omicron was the dominant strain. \"Data regarding the effectiveness of nirmatrelvir against the omicron variant and in patients with previous immunity against SARS-CoV-2 are limited,\" observed Ronen Arbel, PhD, Division of Community Medical Services, Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, and the Maximizing Health Outcomes Research Lab, Sapir College, Sderot, Israel, and colleagues. \"Therefore, our objective was to assess the effectiveness of nirmatrelvir in preventing severe COVID-19 outcomes during the omicron surge in a population with widespread SARS-CoV-2 immunity,\" the investigators indicated. When a surge of infections with the omicron variant began in Israel in January 2022, the public health response was to offer a second booster dose for vulnerable and high-risk populations, and the oral antiviral therapy for nonhospitalized patients contracting the infection who were at high risk for disease progression regardless of vaccination. Although the EUA had been granted based on data from the phase 2\/3 EPIC-HR trial cohort infected primarily with the delta variant, the lead author of that trial, Jennifer Hammond, PhD, Global Product Development, Pfizer, and colleagues have suggested there is rationale and evidence to offer it against Omicron; and to a population which is likely to be seropositive\u2014such as that in Israel\u2014from vaccination, previous infection, or both. \"We acknowledge that trial enrollment was completed before the omicron era.However, in vitro studies show that the omicron variant is as susceptible as the delta variant to nirmatrelvir,\" Hammond and colleagues remarked in a published letter responding to comments on the EPIC-HR trial. \"Seropositive patients typically present with lower baseline viral loads and a lower risk of severe disease. Nevertheless, in the seropositive subgroup (of the EPIC-HR trial), treatment with nirmatrelvir and ritonavir significantly reduced both the viral load and the risk of COVID-19 related hospitalization or death, although the absolute reduction was smaller than that in the seronegative subgroup,\" Hammond and colleagues recounted. The greater absolute reduction in severe COVID-19 in those who were seronegative reflects the greater benefit of the antiviral for those at higher risk. That also underlies the Israeli study findings that absolute reduction of hospitalizations and death compared to those not receiving the treatment was greater in those \u226565 years of age, than in the 40-65 year age group. In the Israeli study, the investigators identified 109,254 patients meeting eligibility criteria during the study period for being at risk for progression to severe illness, including 3902 patients who received the antiviral. The cohort was drawn from records of the Clalit Health Services, a health care organization covering approximately 52% of the Israeli population, and almost two thirds of older adults. Arbel and colleagues reported that the rate of hospitalization due to COVID-19 in patients \u226565 years of age was 14.7 cases per 100,000 person-days in recipients of the antiviral compared to 58.9 cases in the untreated (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15 to 0.49). The aHR for death due to COVID-19 was 0.21 (0.05-0.82). Among those 40 to 64 years of age, however, the rate of hospitalization was 15.2 cases per 100,000 person-days among those treated, compared to 15.8 in the untreated. The aHR for death was 1.32 (0.16-10.75). \"Our study suggests that during the omicron surge, the rates of hospitalization and death due to COVID-19 were significantly lower among adults 65 years of age or older who had received treatment with nirmatrelvir than among younger adults who had received such treatment, regardless of whether a patient had previous SARS-CoV-2 immunity,\" Arbel and colleagues reported.",

        "text":"Medicine is always looking for novel ways to treat diseases and conditions, whether it be through agents, devices or some other unique modality. And this certainly applies to COVID-19. Aethlon Medical has developed its Hemopurifier, which is a therapeutic device designed for the single use depletion of circulating viruses and exosomes from the blood. The San Diego, Calif.,-based medical technology company has been focusing on developing products to diagnose and treat life and organ threatening diseases. Specifically, when it comes to COVID-19, the company performed an in vitro study with its Hemopurifier, that was published in bioRxiv. In their study, known concentrations of seven clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 variants were passed 3 times over columns containing 1 gram of Galanthus nivalis Agglutinin (GNA) affinity resin. The percent decrease in viral titer was compared with a control sample. Viral capture efficiency with the GNA affinity resin ranged from 53% to 89% for all variants tested. Extrapolation of these data would indicate that the binding capacity of the Hemopurifier for viral loads observed in adult patients with severe COVID-19 infection would be more than sufficient. The Hemopurifier holds a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) breakthrough device designation related to life-threatening viruses that are not addressed with approved therapies. In June 2020, the FDA approved an amendment to Aethlon's existing open IDE for the Hemopurifier in life threatening viral infections, to allow for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection. This will allow for up to 40 of these patients to be treated under a new Early Feasibility Study protocol at up to 20 clinical sites in the United States. Contagion recently spoke to Aethlon CEO Charles Fisher, Jr., MD, and Aethlon CMO Steven LaRosa, MD, who were the study\u2019s lead author and coauthor respectively.

        "text":"At more than 2 years into the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been significant advances in treatment and prevention options. COVID-19 mRNA vaccination is highly effective against severe disease and death, but highly infectious variants like Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 are causing breakthrough infections, leading cases to rise once again. To prevent older or otherwise immunocompromised people from severe or fatal infection, Synairgen is developing SNG001, an inhalable COVID-19 treatment for hospitalized persons. Dr. Phillip Monk, the Chief Scientific Officer at Synairgen, joined Contagion to discuss the SNG001 trial data Synairgen presented at the American Thoracic Society 2022 International Conference, held in San Francisco last month. SNG001 is a formulation of Interferon-beta (IFN-\u03b2), a naturally occurring protein that catalyzes the body\u2019s antiviral response. SARS-CoV-2 suppresses this protein, so the inhalable IFN-\u03b2 directly targets the lungs, the primary site of the COVID-19 viral reservoir. SNG001 may retain some efficacy against the Omicron variant. As a host-directed antiviral, Monk says, SNG001 has \u201cbroad spectrum antiviral potential.\u201d \u201cWe have in the lab actually shown the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b2 against Omicron as we have against other variants\u201d The phase 3 SPRINTER trial (SG018; NCT04732949) was a global, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical study. The trial evaluated inhaled SNG001 to treat adults hospitalized with COVID-19 who required supplemental oxygen. SPRINTER included 624 participants, randomly assigned to either SNG001 (n = 309) or placebo (n = 314) in addition to standard of care. In February 2022, Synairgen announced that SPRINTER did not meet its primary endpoints of hospital discharge and illness recovery. Monk says that this can be partially attributed to the standard-of-care COVID-19 treatments improving so much that SNG001 had to demonstrate a greater significance of disease reduction. \u201cBecause patients are doing so much better, it\u2019s much more difficult to show treatment effect on things like hospital discharge,\u201d Mock explained. Despite the efficacy of vaccines and other antivirals, there are still COVID-19 mortalities. Monk says over 2000 patients are being hospitalized in the US each day, and about 200 people a day are dying of COVID-19. Among the trial participants given SNG001, there was a signal in reduction in the relative risk of progression to severe disease or death within 35 days. Monk said that the greatest treatment benefits were observed in older patients, patients with comorbidities, and especially in people who had poor respiratory function at baseline. \u201cThese are people who are having to breathe faster or have low oxygen saturation despite being on oxygen,\u201d Monk said, noting that this treatment population saw a relative risk reduction of 70% for severe disease.",

        "text":"Myocarditis, the inflammation of the middle layer of the wall of the heart muscle, has been a cause for concern during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Though fairly rare, there have been confirmed cases of myocarditis after COVID-19 infection and vaccination. One study, published this week by the American Heart Association in their peer-reviewed journal Circulation, evaluated the link between myocarditis and COVID-19 vaccination and\/or infection. The results suggest that myocarditis was significantly more likely after COVID-19 infection than after COVID-19 vaccination. \u201cWe found that across this large dataset, the entire COVID-19-vaccinated population of England during an important 12-month period of the pandemic when the COVID-19 vaccines first became available, the risk of myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination was quite small compared to the risk of myocarditis after COVID-19 infection,\u201d said statistician Martina Patone, PhD, the first author of the study. The self-controlled case series study included persons 13 years and older who were vaccinated against COVID-19 in England between December 1, 2020, and December 15, 2021. The dataset included nearly 43 million people who had received at least 1 dose of the AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1), Moderna (mRNA-1273), or Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) 2-dose COVID-19 vaccine. Of the 43 million, over 21 million had received at least 2 doses of a primary vaccine series and 1 booster shot. Nearly 6 million of all participants tested positive for COVID-19, either before or after vaccination, during the study period. The investigators stratified participants by individual demographic information, including age and sex. A total of 2861, or 0.007% or people were hospitalized or died with myocarditis during the study period. In 617 of these cases, myocarditis occurred less than a month after COVID-19 vaccination, and 514 of the cases were hospitalized. Notably, people infected with COVID-19 before receiving a COVID-19 vaccine were 11 times more at risk of myocarditis. The risk of COVID-19 infection-related myocarditis was halved after receiving at least 1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The risk of myocarditis did increase after a first dose of any of the 3 COVID-19 vaccines. However, vaccine-associated myocarditis was less likely than infection-associated myocarditis, except after a second dose of the Moderna vaccine. Myocarditis risk was higher on days 1-28 after the second dose of Moderna, a risk that persisted after Moderna booster vaccination. The investigators noted, however, that the Moderna recipients tended to be younger than the other vaccine recipients; myocarditis is known to be more likely in younger persons and this could have skewed the results. \u201cIt is important for the public to understand that myocarditis is rare, and the risk of developing myocarditis after a COVID-19 vaccine is also rare,\u201d said Nicholas Mills, PhD, a cardiology chair at the University of Edinburgh and a coauthor of the study. \u201cThis risk should be balanced against the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccines in preventing severe COVID-19 infection. It is also crucial to understand who is at a higher risk for myocarditis and which vaccine type is associated with increased myocarditis risk.\u201d The study authors noted the risk of myocarditis \u201cremains modest\u201d even after sequential COVID-19 vaccine doses. However, myocarditis risk is higher in young men, particularly after receiving a second dose of Moderna.",

        "text":"Today, the company AIVITA Biomedical, Inc., announced the publication of phase 1 and 2 results from clinical trials for their COVID-19 vaccine candidate. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, AV-COVID-19, was well-tolerated with very infrequent and mild adverse events. The vaccine data was published online today in the journal Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics. The purpose of the study was to explore the potential of personal dendritic cell vaccines to the SARS-CoV-2 protein, establish the safety of a single subcutaneous injection, and analyze the antigen-specific immune response following vaccination. In the double-blind, randomized, phase 1 study, 31 participants were assigned to 1 of 9 formulations of autologous dendritic cells and lymphocytes (DCL). The formulations were incubated with 0.10, 0.33, of 1.0 \u00b5g of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, admixed with either saline, 250, or 500 \u00b5g of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) before injection. The study patients were monitored for safety and humoral response. In phase 2, 145 participants were randomized to 1 of 3 formulations, defined by incubation with the same 3 quantities of spike protein without GM-CSF. Approximately 46.4% of subjects had a grade 1 adverse event, and 6.5% had a grade 2 AE. Among all 169 participants, there were no acute allergic, grade 3 or 4, or serious AEs. \u201cThe superior safety profile is likely due to our vaccine containing only the subject's primed immune cells and none of the viral antigen, virus, mRNA, DNA, animal components or immune adjuvants found in other vaccines,\u201d said Robert O. Dillman, MD, chief medical officer at AIVITA. In phase 1 of the AV-COVID-19 study, anti-receptor binding domain antibodies increased in 70% of study patients by day 28. In phase 2, among the 127 participants who did not have high levels of gamma interferon-producing cells at baseline, 94.4% had increased by day 14 and 96.8% increased by day 28. \u201cOur vaccine uniquely induces direct cell-mediated immune memory,\u201d said Gabriel Nistor, MD, chief science officer at AIVITA. \u201cThis is an important distinction from currently available COVID-19 vaccines which all induce a transitory antibody-mediated immune response.\u201d AIVITA Biomedical, Inc. was founded in 2016, specializing in cancer immunotherapy and personalized vaccines. According to AIVITA CEO, Hans S. Keirstead, PhD, \u201cOur Vaccine-Enabling Kit can be shipped anywhere in the world, enabling distributed scaled manufacturing, and can be modified within days to accommodate new variants or entirely new pathogens.\"",

        "text":"Two and a half years into the COVID-19 pandemic, it\u2019s become clear that the disease can continue to take a far-reaching toll on the body long after the initial sore throat and coughing has subsided. One outcome of infection is an increase in hypercoagulability, with thromboembolism a threat in the weeks and months after a person is hospitalized with COVID-19. While several studies have examined the incidence of thrombotic complications following COVID-19 infection, up until now these studies have been small and have not included other cohorts for comparison. A team of scientists at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia conducted a retrospective cohort study designed to compare the 90-day risks of arterial and venous thromboembolism in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared with patients hospitalized with influenza, as influenza is known to be a risk factor for embolic events. COVID-positive patients were evaluated for thromboembolism in the time period before COVID-19 vaccines were available (April 2020-November 2020) and during vaccine availability (December 2020-April 2021), while influenza patients were assessed between 2018 and 2019. The study was published in JAMA. The study, which included 85,637 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and 8,269 patients hospitalized with influenza, found that the 90-day absolute risk of venous thromboembolism in patients who\u2019d had COVID-19 was significantly higher than in those who\u2019d had influenza. Hospitalized influenza patients had a 90-day risk of venous thromboembolism of 5.3% (95% confidence interval, 4.9%-5.9%) versus 9.5% (95% CI, 9.2-9.7) in COVID-19 patients before vaccines were available and 10.9% (95% CI, 10.6%-11.1%) in COVID-19 patients during vaccine availability. In contrast, while the incidence of arterial thromboembolism was higher than that of venous thromboembolism overall, little difference in arterial thromboembolism risk was found between hospitalized COVID-19 patients and hospitalized influenza patients. The 90-day risk of arterial thromboembolism in influenza patients was 14.4% (95% CI, 13.6%-15.2%) compared with 15.8% (95% CI, 15.5%-16.2%) in COVID-19 patients pre-vaccine availability and 16.3% (95% CI, 16.0-16.6) during the time vaccines were distributed. Venous and arterial thromboembolism are quite distinct processes triggered by different mechanisms, the authors explain. \u201cSARS-CoV-2 infection of endothelial cells incites inflammation and abnormalities in coagulation (ie, increased concentrations of D-dimer, antiphospholipid antibodies; decreased concentrations of anticoagulant proteins; increased platelet activity), and these abnormalities might have more of an effect on risk of venous than arterial thromboembolism and may be more marked for COVID-19 than influenza,\u201d Vincent Lo Re, MD, MSCE, associate professor of medicine at the Perelman School of Medicine and an author of the study, told Contagion. The risk of arterial thromboembolism was higher in hospitalized COVID-19 vs. influenza patients in 1 particular group, however: those with existing cardiovascular disease. The 90-day risk of arterial thromboembolism in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular disease was 21% before vaccines were available and 21.3% during vaccine availability. For patients hospitalized with influenza, the risk was 18.2%. While the exact reason for the higher arterial thromboembolism risk in COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular disease is not clear, Lo Re suggested it may have to do with the microvascular and macrovascular changes that occur with cardiovascular disease. COVID-19 patients without a history of venous thromboembolism had a significantly elevated risk of venous thromboembolism in the 90-day follow-up period compared with influenza patients, both before and during COVID-19 vaccine availability. Interestingly, for those who had a history of venous thromboembolism, the risk of a venous thrombotic event was not significantly higher in COVID-19 vs. influenza patients before vaccines were available yet was significantly higher during vaccine availability. Lo Re explained that these discrepancies could have to do with therapies dispensed prior to hospitalization. \u201cPatients with venous thromboembolism history might\u2026have been more likely to receive intermediate or treatment doses of anticoagulant therapy during their hospitalization, although inpatient therapies could not be captured with this data,\u201d he said. \u201cPatients without a history of VTE likely were not prescribed anticoagulant therapy that could have mitigated the development of these events.\u201d The study findings underscore that there are real differences between influenza and COVID-19 that place patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at greater risk for venous thromboembolism. Patients with COVID-19 who are admitted to the hospital and are at high risk for venous thromboembolism should be closely monitored to potentially prevent this complication.",

        "text":"The FDA has authorized the Moderna (mRNA-1273.214) and Pfizer-BioNTech Bivalent COVID-19 Vaccines to be used as booster doses. The updated vaccines include 2 mRNA components of the SARS-CoV-2 virus: one of the original wild type strain of SARS-CoV-2; and the other one has varying lineages of the Omicron variant. \u201cThe COVID-19 vaccines, including boosters, continue to save countless lives and prevent the most serious outcomes (hospitalization and death) of COVID-19,\u201d FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf, MD, said in a statement. Public health officials have been working to make the boosters available as the northern hemisphere begins to go into the influenza and respiratory illness season. \u201cAs we head into fall and begin to spend more time indoors, we strongly encourage anyone who is eligible to consider receiving a booster dose with a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine to provide better protection against currently circulating variants,\u201d Califf said in the same statement. For each of the bivalent COVID-19 vaccines authorized today, the FDA evaluated immunogenicity and safety data from a clinical study of a booster dose of a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine that contained a component of the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 and a component of omicron lineage BA.1. The FDA considers such data as relevant and supportive of vaccines containing a component of the omicron variant BA.4 and BA.5 lineages. Furthermore, data pertaining to the safety and effectiveness of the current mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, which have been administered to millions of people, including during the Omicron waves of COVID-19, contributed to the agency\u2019s evaluation. Moderna Booster In their submission, Moderna cited their study which they said met all primary endpoints, including superior neutralizing antibody response against Omicron (BA.1) when compared to a 50 \u00b5g booster dose of mRNA-1273 in previously uninfected participants, as well as potent neutralizing antibody responses against the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 compared to the currently authorized booster (mRNA-1273) regardless of prior infection status or age. The Moderna clinical study evaluated the safety of a booster dose of the bivalent vaccine (original and Omicron BA.1) included approximately 800 participants 18 years of age and older who had previously received a two dose primary series and one booster dose of the monovalent Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, and then at least 3 months later, received a second booster dose with either the monovalent Moderna COVID-19 vaccine or Moderna\u2019s investigational bivalent COVID-19 vaccine (original and Omicron BA.1). Pfizer-BioNTech Booster In the Pfizer-BioNtech filing, the companies said their Omicron BA.1-adapted bivalent vaccine elicited a superior immune response against the Omicron BA.1 variant compared to the companies\u2019 current COVID-19 vaccine. The Omicron BA.1-adapted bivalent vaccine was well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile. To evaluate the effectiveness of a single booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, Bivalent for individuals 12 years of age and older, the FDA analyzed immune response data among approximately 600 adults greater than 55 years of age who had previously received a 2-dose primary series and one booster dose with the monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. These participants received a second booster dose of either the monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s investigational bivalent COVID-19 vaccine (original and Omicron BA.1) 4.7 to 13.1 months after the first booster dose. After one month, the immune response against BA.1 of the participants who received the bivalent vaccine was better than the immune response of those who had received the monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Both vaccine boosters are indicated for people who it has been at least two months since their completed primary vaccination or have received the most recent booster dose with any authorized or approved monovalent COVID-19 vaccine. However, an important distinction is that the Moderna vaccine is authorized for people 18 years and older and the Pfizer vaccine is for people 12 years of age and older. We are confident in the evidence supporting these authorizations,\u201d Peter Marks, MD, PhD, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in the FDA statement. \u201cThe public can be assured that a great deal of care has been taken by the FDA to ensure that these bivalent COVID-19 vaccines meet our rigorous safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality standards for emergency use authorization.\u201d",

        "text":"Is ivermectin effective for COVID-19? Key messages We found no evidence to support the use of ivermectin for treating COVID-19 or preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. The evidence base improved slightly in this update, but is still limited. Evaluation of ivermectin is continuing in 31 ongoing trials, and we will update this review again when their results become available. What is ivermectin? Ivermectin is a medicine used to treat parasites, such as intestinal parasites in animals, and scabies in humans. It is inexpensive and is widely used in regions of the world where parasitic infestations are common. It has few unwanted effects. Medical regulators have not approved ivermectin for COVID-19. What did we want to find out? We wanted to update our knowledge of whether ivermectin reduces death, illness, and length of infection in people with COVID-19, or is useful in prevention of the infection. We included trials comparing the medicine to placebo (dummy treatment), usual care, or treatments for COVID-19 that are known to work to some extent, such as dexamethasone. We excluded trials comparing ivermectin to other medicines that do not work, like hydroxychloroquine, or whose effectiveness against COVID-19 is uncertain. We evaluated the effects of ivermectin in infected people on: \u2013 people dying; \u2013 whether people's COVID-19 got better or worse; \u2013 quality of life; \u2013 serious and non-serious unwanted effects; \u2013 viral clearance. For prevention, we sought the effect on preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. What did we do? We searched for randomized controlled trials that investigated ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19. People treated in hospital or as outpatients had to have laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. In this update, we also investigated the trustworthiness of the trials and only included them if they fulfilled clear ethical and scientific criteria. We compared and summarized the results of the trials and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on common criteria such as trial methods and sizes. What did we find? We excluded seven of the 14 trials included in the previous review as these trials did not fulfil the expected ethical and scientific criteria. Together with four new trials, we included 11 trials with 3409 participants that investigated ivermectin combined with any usual care compared to the same usual care or placebo. For treatment, there were five trials of people in hospital with moderate COVID-19 and six trials of outpatients with mild COVID-19. The trials used different doses of ivermectin and different durations of treatment. No trial investigated ivermectin to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also found 31 ongoing trials, and an additional 28 trials still requiring clarification from the authors or not yet published. Main results Treating people in hospital with COVID-19 We do not know whether ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment: \u2013 leads to more or fewer deaths (3 trials, 230 people); \u2013 worsens or improves patients' condition, assessed by need for ventilation or death (2 trials, 118 people); \u2013 increases or reduces serious unwanted events (2 trials, 197 people). Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, may make little or no difference to: \u2013 improving patients' condition, assessed by discharge from hospital (1 trial, 73 people); \u2013 non-serious unwanted events (3 trials, 228 participants). Seven days after treatment, ivermectin may make little or no difference to reduction of negative COVID-19 tests (3 trials, 231 participants) compared with placebo or usual care. Treating outpatients with COVID-19 Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, probably makes little or no difference to people dying (6 trials, 2860 people). Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, makes little or no difference to quality of life (1 trial, 1358 people). Ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care 28 days after treatment, may make little or no difference to: \u2013 worsening patients' condition, assessed by admission to hospital or death (2 trials, 590 people); \u2013 serious unwanted events (5 trials, 1502 people); \u2013 non-serious unwanted events (5 trials, 1502 participants); \u2013 improving people's COVID\u201019 symptoms in the 14 days after treatment (2 trials, 478 people); \u2013 number of people with negative COVID-19 tests 7 days after treatment (2 trials, 331 people). What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the evidence, especially for outpatients, improved since the last review version, because we could look at more participants included in high-quality trials. Although we are quite certain regarding our results on risk of people dying and quality of life, the confidence in the evidence is still low for many other outpatient and inpatient outcomes because there were only few events measured. The methods differed between trials, and they did not report everything we were interested in, such as relevant outcomes. How up to date is this evidence? The systematic literature search is up to date to 16 December 2021. Additionally, we included trials with > 1000 participants up to April 2022.",

We will update this review if their results change our conclusions. What are antibiotics? Antibiotics are cheap and common medicines used to treat bacterial infections. However, recent laboratory studies found that some antibiotics slowed the reproduction of some viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In laboratory tests, one antibiotic, azithromycin, reduced viral activity and inflammation, and so it has been studied as a potential treatment for COVID-19. We need good evidence before giving antibiotics for COVID-19 because overuse or misuse of antibiotics can lead to \u2018antimicrobial resistance\u2019, where organisms that cause infection change, so that antibiotics stop working. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know if antibiotics reduce death, severity of disease, and length of infection in people with COVID-19, if they have an effect on quality of life or cause unwanted effects. We included studies that compared antibiotics to placebo (dummy treatment), no treatment, usual care, another antibiotic, or treatments for COVID-19 that are known to work to some extent, such as remdesivir or dexamethasone. We excluded treatments that we know do not work for COVID-19, such as hydroxychloroquine, or have an unknown influence on the disease. We evaluated the effects of antibiotics on people with COVID-19 on: \u2022 people dying; \u2022 whether people's COVID-19 symptoms got better or worse; \u2022 unwanted effects; \u2022 heart rhythm problems; \u2022 quality of life. What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated antibiotics to treat people with COVID-19 in hospital or as outpatients. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on common criteria such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 11 studies with 11,281 people that investigated antibiotics to treat COVID-19. All 11 studies investigated azithromycin. Nine studies (10,807 people) compared azithromycin to no treatment, placebo or usual care alone. Two studies compared azithromycin to another antibiotic: lincomycin (1 study, 24 people) and clarithromycin (1 study, 450 people), however, they did not report data that we could use in this review, so our results apply to azithromycin only. Seven studies included people with moderate to severe COVID-19 in hospital and four studies included outpatients with mild COVID-19. The studies used different doses of azithromycin and different durations of treatment. We found 19 ongoing studies. We have not classified 15 completed studies because we are waiting for more information from the authors, or they have not yet been published. Main results Inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19 Azithromycin compared to usual care alone, does not lead to more or fewer deaths in the 28 days after treatment (4 studies, 8600 people). Compared to usual care alone or placebo, azithromycin probably does not: \u2022 worsen (1 study, 7311 people) or \u2022 improve patients\u2019 condition (3 studies, 8172 people); \u2022 increase or decrease serious unwanted events (4 studies, 794 people), and heart rhythm problems (4 studies, 7865 people). Azithromycin may increase non-serious unwanted effects slightly compared to usual care alone (3 studies, 355 people). No studies looked at quality of life. Outpatients with mild COVID-19 Compared to usual care alone or placebo azithromycin may make little or no difference to: \u2022 people dying in the 28 days after treatment (3 studies, 876 people); \u2022 whether the people's disease worsened in the 28 days after treatment (3 studies, 876 people) or \u2022 whether people's COVID-19 symptoms got better in the 14 days after treatment (1 study, 138 people). We don't know whether azithromycin compared to usual care alone or placebo increases or decreases serious unwanted effects (2 studies, 454 participants). No studies reported non-serious unwanted events, heart rhythm problems, or quality of life. What are the limitations of the evidence? We are very confident in the evidence on azithromycin for COVID-19 inpatients. However, we are less confident in the evidence on azithromycin in outpatients, mainly because there were few studies that also had some flaws, therefore we could not draw reliable conclusions. We found relevant evidence on only one antibiotic, azithromycin, so we do not know the effects of other antibiotics for treating COVID-19. We will continue to search for new studies to fill this evidence gap. Our evidence does not suggest azithromycin is an effective treatment for COVID-19, especially given the danger of antimicrobial resistance. Azithromycin or any other antibiotic should not be used to treat COVID-19 outside well-designed studies. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is up to date to 14 June 2021.",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.cochrane.org\/CD013705\/INFECTN_how-accurate-are-rapid-antigen-tests-diagnosing-covid-19",
        "text":"Key messages \u2022 Rapid antigen tests are most accurate when they are used in people who have signs or symptoms of COVID-19, especially during the first week of illness. People who test negative may still be infected. \u2022 Rapid antigen tests are considerably less accurate when they are used in people with no signs or symptoms of infection, but do perform better in people who have been in contact with someone who has confirmed COVID-19. \u2022 The accuracy of rapid antigen tests varies between tests that are produced by different manufacturers and there is a lack of evidence for many commercially available tests. What are rapid point-of-care antigen tests for COVID-19? Rapid point-of-care tests aim to confirm or rule out COVID-19 infection in people with or without COVID-19 symptoms. They: \u2022 are portable, so they can be used wherever the patient is (at the point-of-care) or in non-healthcare settings such as in the home; \u2022 are easy to perform, with a minimum amount of extra equipment or complicated preparation steps; \u2022 are less expensive than standard laboratory tests; \u2022 do not require a specialist operator or setting; and \u2022 provide results \u2018while you wait\u2019. For this review we were interested in rapid antigen tests, sometimes referred to as \u2018lateral flow tests\u2019. These tests identify proteins on the virus in samples taken from the nose or throat. They come in disposable plastic cassettes, similar to over-the-counter pregnancy tests. Why is this question important? People with suspected COVID-19 need to know quickly whether they are infected, so that they can self-isolate, receive treatment, and inform close contacts. Currently, COVID-19 infection is confirmed by a laboratory test called RT-PCR, which uses specialist equipment and often takes at least 24 hours to produce a result. In many places, rapid antigen tests have opened access to testing for many more people, with and without symptoms, and in locations other than healthcare settings. Faster diagnosis of COVID-19 infection could allow people to take appropriate action more quickly, with the potential to reduce the spread of COVID-19, but it is important to understand how accurate they are and the best way to use them. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know whether commercially available, rapid point-of-care antigen tests are accurate enough to diagnose COVID-19 infection reliably, and to find out if accuracy differs in people with and without symptoms. What did we do? We looked for studies that measured the accuracy of any commercially produced rapid antigen test in people who were also tested for COVID-19 using RT-PCR. People could be tested in hospital, in the community or in their own homes. Studies could test people with or without symptoms. What did we find? We included 155 studies in the review. The main results are based on 152 studies investigating a total of 100,462 nose or throat samples; COVID-19 was confirmed in 16,822 of these samples. Studies investigated 49 different antigen tests. Around 60% of studies took place in Europe. Main results In people with confirmed COVID-19, antigen tests correctly identified COVID-19 infection in an average of 73% of people with symptoms, compared to 55% of people without symptoms. Tests were most accurate when used in the first week after symptoms began (an average of 82% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). This is likely to be because people have the most virus in their system in the first days after they are infected. For people with no symptoms, tests were most accurate in people likely to have been in contact with a case of COVID-19 infection (an average of 64% of confirmed cases had positive antigen tests). In people who did not have COVID-19, antigen tests correctly ruled out infection in 99.6% of people with symptoms and 99.7% of people without symptoms. Different brands of tests varied in accuracy. Summary results (combined from more than one study per test brand) for seven tests met World Health Organization (WHO) standards as \u2018acceptable\u2019 for confirming and ruling out COVID-19 in people with signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Two more tests met the WHO acceptable standard in one study each. No test met this standard when evaluated in people without symptoms. Using summary results for symptomatic people tested during the first week after symptoms began, if 1000 people with symptoms had the antigen test, and 50 (5%) of them really had COVID-19: \u2022 45 people would test positive for COVID-19. Of these, 5 people (11%) would not have COVID-19 (false positive result). \u2022 955 people would test negative for COVID-19. Of these, 10 people (1.0%) would actually have COVID-19 (false negative result). In people with no symptoms of COVID-19 the number of confirmed cases is expected to be much lower than in people with symptoms. Using summary results for people with no known exposure to COVID-19 in a bigger population of 10,000 people with no symptoms, where 50 (0.5%) of them really had COVID-19: \u2022 62 people would test positive for COVID-19. Of these, 30 people (48%) would not have COVID-19 (false positive result). \u2022 9938 people would test negative for COVID-19. Of these, 18 people (0.2%) would actually have COVID-19 (false negative result). What are the limitations of the evidence? In general, studies used relatively rigorous methods, particularly for selecting participants and performing the tests. Sometimes studies did not perform the test on the people for whom it was intended and did not follow the manufacturers\u2019 instructions for using the test. Sometimes the tests were not carried out at the point of care. Studies used less rigorous methods for confirming the presence or absence of COVID-19 infection; 91% of studies relied on a single negative RT-PCR result as evidence of no COVID-19 infection. Results from different test brands varied, and relatively few studies directly compared one test brand with another. Finally, not all studies gave enough information about their participants for us to judge how long they had had symptoms, or even whether or not they had symptoms. What does this mean? In people with symptoms, some rapid antigen tests are accurate enough to replace RT-PCR, especially for ruling in the presence of infection. Alternatively, where RT-PCR is available, rapid antigen tests could be used to select which people with symptoms require further testing with RT-PCR, thereby reducing the burden on laboratory services. This would be most useful when quick decisions are needed about patient care, to identify outbreaks, to allow people to self-isolate more quickly, or to initiate contact tracing. Rapid antigen tests are less good at ruling out infection in symptomatic people - individuals who receive a negative rapid antigen test result may still be infected. Rapid antigen tests are less accurate when used in people with no symptoms of COVID-19. More evidence is needed to understand the accuracy of rapid testing in people without symptoms and the extent to which repeated testing strategies can lead to reduced transmission, either for tests carried out at home or in non-healthcare settings such as schools. There is no independent evidence to support the use of many test brands. More direct comparisons of test brands are needed, with testers following manufacturers\u2019 instructions. How up-to-date is this review? This review updates our previous review and includes evidence published up to 8 March 2021.",

        "text":"September 1, 2022 expert reaction to study looking at a method attempting to identify people at greater genetic risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease before any symptoms appear A study published in PLOS Genetics looks at the use of a genetic risk score for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Dr Rosa Sancho, Head of Research at Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, said: \u201cOur risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease comes down to a complex mix of our age, genetics and lifestyle. The disease begins in the brain up to two decades before symptoms start to show and many researchers believe this is a critical time in which potential drugs are likely to have the best chance of success. Current ways of identifying people at greatest risk of Alzheimer\u2019s are often based on a single genetic factor and mean that clinical trials for new treatments are not as efficient as they could be. \u201cBy evaluating 7.1million gene variants, the team developed a more comprehensive genetic risk score for Alzheimer\u2019s. This genetic risk score, like others that have been developed previously, is unlikely to be useful for screening people for Alzheimer\u2019s or supporting an early diagnosis, but it could help to recruit people with early Alzheimer\u2019s into clinical trials. \u201cThe researchers used their genetic risk scores to identify proteins whose levels changed in people at a high risk of the disease. Several of the proteins they identified have not been studied in Alzheimer\u2019s research, and they may help to unlock new understanding of what causes the disease, provide new targets for future drugs, or have potential as biological markers that could help to identify people in the early stages. \u201cTo realise the potential of these new discoveries it is critical researchers follow up these findings with more research.\u201d \u2018Neurocognitive trajectory and proteomic signature of inherited risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease\u2019 by Manish D.

        "text":"Imelda fled sexual violence at the hands of drug cartels in rural Puebla, about two hours outside of Mexico City, and arrived in New York City in 2013. She had no health insurance, barely spoke English, and as an undocumented immigrant, she avoided situations that required revealing her identity. So in March 2020, even as the city became the national epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, Imelda, who asked that her surname not be used due to risk of deportation, resisted going to the hospital for her escalating fever and fatigue. \u201cWhen the symptoms began, I wanted to go,\u201d Imelda says, but her fears outweighed her desire for treatment. Since arriving in the U.S. Imelda had visited a hospital only once, for the birth of her second daughter. But in addition to worries about revealing her immigration status, she was afraid of incurring medical bills that exceeded what she earned cleaning houses. Delaying or forgoing care for COVID-19 was a decision that Imelda and many other undocumented immigrants made due to the unique healthcare challenges they face in America\u2014challenges of inequality that are having nationwide consequences. The U.S. is home to more immigrants than any other country in the world: Per the latest estimates, 46.7 million foreign-born individuals reside in America, making up nearly 14 percent of the national population. About 11 million of these people are undocumented, but they\u2019ve filled critical jobs that citizens often don\u2019t want, including working in agricultural fields, the service industry, and in healthcare facilities, while paying billions in taxes each year. Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited. According to a December 2020 report from the bipartisan political organization FWD.us, 69 percent of undocumented immigrant workers in the U.S. held jobs that were deemed essential during the pandemic\u2014and they were 50 percent more likely to get COVID-19 than U.S.-born workers. For many, that\u2019s meant surviving a public health emergency while working low-paying jobs (often on the frontlines) that don\u2019t offer benefits; it can also mean being ineligible for free or subsidized public health insurance. To compound these problems, countless workers are unaware of their coverage options or fear accessing them. A 2017 study found that about half of the undocumented immigrants living in America lacked necessary health insurance. That often leaves a large proportion of this community delaying care, which could result in health complications or an advanced illness and a greater reliance on emergency rooms. \u201cWhen they\u2019re unable to pay those costs, the money goes into uncompensated care costs, raising the debt in the healthcare system,\u201d says Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit organization focusing on national health issues. For those like Imelda living in the shadows, the COVID-19 pandemic once again revealed the deep-seated inequities to accessing medical care in America. Even today, people in this underserved community continue to suffer, often with little help. Too little care, too late In addition to medical costs and insurance access, a sustained lack of trust has dissuaded the country\u2019s growing immigrant population from engaging with the healthcare system. This mistrust arises in part from the discrimination immigrants have experience based on how they look, where they\u2019re from, or their inability to speak English. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard,\u201d Imelda says. Anti-immigrant rhetoric has also kept the undocumented community from accessing timely care. At the Elmhurst Hospital Center in New York City, which caters largely to New York City\u2019s low-income immigrant population, \u201cwe\u2019ve watched our volume dip at times when there are national discussions about immigration and whether it was good or bad for the country,\u201d says Stuart Kessler, one of the hospital\u2019s emergency medicine physicians. In Houston, researchers noted that Latina immigrants delayed their first prenatal care visit and reduced the number of visits overall during their pregnancies after July 2015, when rhetoric around deportation intensified in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election. That fear of accessing healthcare in a climate of growing anti-immigrant sentiment continued through 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic hit and further exacerbated already existing barriers between the healthcare system and this underserved population. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t realize our systems of care were this fractured, and that so many people could fall through the cracks because the cracks were just so huge,\u201d says Jairo G\u00fazman, president of Mexican Coalition, an advocacy group for child and family rights based in New York. That was true for Imelda in March 2020. With no one to consult and no place to isolate, she endured her COVID-19-like symptoms for a week in the three-bedroom apartment she shared with seven others\u2014including her husband and two kids. As she found herself struggling to breathe a hospital visit became an urgent necessity. She went to a hospital and, at an overwhelmed emergency room, nervously waited for an online interpreter so she could talk with the medical staff and find out if she had COVID-19. \u201cFive minutes is all I got,\u201d she says, which wasn\u2019t enough for her to explain all her symptoms while also answering the doctor\u2019s questions and noting his instructions about next steps. The medical team didn\u2019t give her a COVID-19 test because a chest x-ray showed no irregularities. Instead a nurse gave her Tylenol to reduce her fever and, within a few hours, Imelda was sent home with the assurance that she\u2019d receive check-in phone calls and could return if her symptoms worsened. But no calls came, and Imelda\u2019s health continued to deteriorate. Over the next four weeks, her breathing became increasingly difficult and her body was consumed by extreme exhaustion. \u201cI would walk a little and I\u2019d be gasping for breath, and on some days I couldn\u2019t stand up at all,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought I was done\u2014this was it.\u201d A $400 bill from her initial ER visit deterred her from seeking further care. (The hospital later reduced her bill by half because she had lost her cleaning job.) Recalling these struggles brought Imelda to tears when we met at her home in May 2022. She is aware that the consequences of delaying care could have been fatal, and she knows others who are still batting lingering symptoms without seeking medical help. COVID-19 hits those living in the shadows Even now the true impact of COVID-19 on undocumented immigrants, especially in the early months of the pandemic, remains murky. One of Susan Rodriguez\u2019s patients in New York\u2014an 88-year-old Ecuadorian women\u2014lost her son to COVID-19, possibly because they waited too long to seek medical care. They were both undocumented and uninsured and decided to treat his symptoms at home. Eventually, they had no choice but to call 911 and take him to a hospital. But the medical interventions came too late. He passed away two days later, leaving his mother distraught and unsure how to cope. \u201cShe had never sought therapy in her life,\u201d says Rodriguez, a clinical social worker and a licensed therapist. \u201cShe came with a lot of guilt,\u201d and wished she had known she could have applied for emergency Medicaid to cover the costs. \u201cWe heard of cases where people stayed at home or delayed care for COVID-19 almost every day,\u201d adds Don Garcia, medical director at Cl\u00ednica Romero, a community health center in Los Angeles that primarily serves Latino and immigrant populations. Some of these people narrowly escaped death. Antonio, who asked that his full name not be used due this immigration status, was one of them. He is undocumented and had arrived in Oxnard, a city in the Greater Los Angeles Area, from Mexico in 2019. Terrified of revealing his personal details, the 40-year-old restaurant worker remained uninsured and unvaccinated. He got infected in December during the Omicron wave and his condition deteriorated rapidly. \u201cBy the sixth day I was so desperate that I wanted to go to a hospital,\u201d he says, but he decided against it because of his immigration status. \u201cThere were three days when I was completely lost, barely conscious, I had no clue if I was alive,\u201d he says, overwhelmed with emotion as he shifts in his chair and grabs a tissue to wipe away tears. Embarrassed, Antonio apologizes and looks around the conference room at the nonprofit Mixteco Indigena Community Organization Project\u2019s office in Oxnard in April this year. After a pause, Antonio recalls how he begged his boss to take him back after missing work for almost 22 days; he was behind on rent and had a family to support. \u201cI think it\u2019s very different to have COVID as an immigrant in this country,\u201d he says. Those who did turn to the medical system sometimes experienced discriminatory behavior in the form of being treated rudely or disrespectfully for not speaking English, or they felt that they weren\u2019t being heard. \u201cPeople in the healthcare system can come with a biased lens,\u201d says Mireya Vilar-Compte, a public health professor at Montclair State University in New Jersey with expertise in healthcare inequities. She stresses a need for more doctors, nurses, and administrative staff from diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds as one part of the solution. Living with long COVID More than two years into the pandemic, undocumented immigrant populations still feel they have few places to turn as they battle the aftereffects of the disease that disproportionately impacted them. With little help, some are enduring long COVID symptoms, including fatigue, brain fog, and breathing and sleeping difficulties, as well as anxiety and depression. In Los Angeles, Ana, who asked that her last name not be used fearing deportation, has been self-medicating to manage the fatigue and body pain that has lingered for months after her COVID-19 infection last summer. She has been avoiding a visit to a doctor because she\u2019s uninsured and undocumented, so the 38-year-old part-time house cleaner uses painkillers that she buys from street vendors in downtown L.A. \u201cIt has gotten to a point where I feel depressed that I\u2019m going to have to take these pills for life,\u201d she says. \u201cI need to work fast, but I do get tired.\u201d Fortunately for Imelda, who despite being vaccinated has contracted COVID-19 twice since her March 2020 diagnosis, New York expanded its healthcare-for-all program to her borough, Queens, in September 2020. Called NYC Care, this city-funded program guarantees low-cost and no-cost services to all New Yorkers who don\u2019t qualify or can\u2019t afford health insurance, irrespective of immigration status. Since then Imelda has been seeking healthcare to cope with her heart palpitations, trouble sleeping and breathing, and post-COVID depression. She\u2019s had MRIs, cardiac screenings, and has been seeking physical and psychotherapy. Nationwide, though, such programs are rare, Pillai says. Today, seven states and the District of Columbia offer some type of healthcare coverage for some or all age groups of the undocumented population, but she says the effort should be expanded nationwide. When individuals can use primary and preventative care, they rely less on emergency medical services, which are extremely expensive. \u201cEconomically, in the long-term, it\u2019s not the best idea to prevent some groups from accessing benefits to which a lot of them already contribute,\u201d Pillai says. But such an effort would require addressing the existing bias and discrimination in the medical system. Despite now being insured, Imelda says \u201cI don\u2019t feel like they see me the same way as they see someone who\u2019s American.\u201d Especially when it comes to healthcare, \u201cI wish everyone was treated the same.\u201d",

        "title":"I Get My Child Pfizer's Omicron Booster Shot?",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.verywellfamily.com\/should-i-get-my-child-the-omicron-booster-shot-6502950",
        "text":"UPDATE: December 9, 2022 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the bivalent booster shots from Pfizer and Moderna for children ages 6 months and older on December 8. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) signed off on the approval one day later, making the shots available at your local pharmacy or healthcare provider. This article has been updated with the latest information. Key Takeaways The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended COVID-19 booster shots targeting the Omicron COVID-19 variant. As of December 2022, the bivalent booster is available for children ages 6 months and older. Both Pfizer and Moderna have bivalent boosters available, with different parameters for each. There's a new weapon in the battle against COVID-19. On September 1, 2022, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) signed off on its advisory panel's recommended use of COVID-19 vaccine boosters. It came just weeks after Pfizer and Moderna both applied for emergency use authorizations (EUA) for their boosters, which target the BA.4\/BA.5 variants. Originally, Moderna's bivalent booster was targeted for use in people 18 and older, while Pfizer-BioNTech's shot was made available for people 12 and up. Tweens and teens were among the first children eligible for the updated booster. But those ages have since been expanded. In a statement, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH, said, \"the updated COVID-19 boosters are formulated to better protect against the most recently circulating COVID-19 variant.\" She goes on to add, \"if you are eligible, there is no bad time to get your COVID-19 booster and I strongly encourage you to receive it.\u201d With this news, parents understandably have lots of questions. With kids in school and germs circulating, parents want to know how to time their kids\u2019 boosters. Is My Child Eligible for the Bivalent Booster? Pfizer\u2019s vaccine for kids aged 12 and up was rolled out in the days and weeks after Labor Day 2022, just in time for many children to head back to school. Moderna soon followed with its vaccine for that age group. By October, the FDA authorized the updated bivalent boosters from Pfizer and Moderna for everyone ages 5 and older. The Pfizer booster was made available for kids 5 and up, and the Moderna booster was for kids 6 and up. Kids can get these boosters two months after completing their primary series or last booster. Then in December, officials added parameters for those over 6 months old. The updated Moderna bivalent booster can be given to any child over 6 months old who completed their primary series of the original vaccine at least two months ago. \u201cMore children now have the opportunity to update their protection against COVID-19 with a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine, and we encourage parents and caregivers of those eligible to consider doing so\u2014especially as we head into the holidays and winter months where more time will be spent indoors,\u201d FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf, MD, says in a statement. For Pfizer, children between 6 months and 4 years old that have not yet had any COVID vaccinations\u2014or have not yet gotten a third dose\u2014will receive the bivalent booster as part of their primary series. But, this is important: Children between 6 months and 4 years old who have already had three doses of the original vaccine will not be eligible to get a bivalent booster dose at this time. The FDA says they expect more data for this group in January and will evaluate it then. What to Know About the Omicron-Specific Boosters The bivalent booster combines the BA.4\/BA.5 variants with the original vaccine formula. For kids 12 and up, the dose is the same for this booster as it was for other Pfizer boosters: a 30-\u00b5g dose. As such, experts expect any potential side effects of this vaccine will be similar to the original. \u201cThe expected side effect profile would be very similar to the original vaccine because the mRNA vaccine technology is the same for both,\u201d explains Kari Simonsen, MD, MBA, senior vice president, pediatrician-in-chief, and chair of pediatrics at Children\u2019s Hospital & Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska. According to the FDA, in a clinical study of the original Moderna booster, common side effects for those ages 17 through 36 months included irritability\/crying, sleepiness, and loss of appetite. For those between 37 months and 5 years, other side effects were fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, and nausea. What Are the Benefits of the New Booster for Kids? Experts agree this new bivalent vaccine will have many benefits for kids who are eligible to receive it. First of all, vaccines and boosters generally protect kids from the most serious effects of a COVID-19 infection. \u201cThe vaccines reduce the risk of death and serious illness from COVID-19,\u201d says Ali Alhassani, MD, MSc, head of clinical at Summer Health. \u201cWhile it is true that death due to COVID-19 is extremely rare in children, the risk is not zero.\u201d Additionally, Dr. Alhassani says COVID vaccines and boosters have shown protection against serious COVID complications such as MIS-C (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children). Vaccines also make kids less likely to contract COVID and spread the infection to vulnerable people, he adds. The fact that these new boosters are updated with the currently circulating variants means they will likely have broader protection than the boosters based on the original formula, says Dr. Alhassani. \u201cThese new boosters are targeted for the Omicron BA.4\/BA.5 variant, the dominant strains in the U.S.,\u201d he explains. \u201cThat fact suggests that they would offer broader protection than the first Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine that targeted the initial COVID-19 strain alone.\u201d Children who have recovered from MIS-C should make sure to stay on top of their COVID vaccinations. Research published in January 2023 showed patients with a history of MIS-C had no adverse reactions to the vaccine. One caveat\u2014if your child has had MIS-C, they should wait 90 days after diagnosis to receive the vaccine. When Should I Get My Child Boosted? Vaccination rates for children in the younger age groups are relatively low. As of November 30, 2022, less than 5% of kids between the ages of 2 and 4 years old have completed their primary series, according to the CDC. That number is even lower for those under 2 years old, at just under 3%. Only 2% of children ages 5 to 11 have gotten their bivalent booster. Given these numbers, health officials are hoping to encourage more parents to not only get their children boosted but also vaccinated if they haven't already\u2014and do it as soon as possible. \u201cParents and caregivers can be assured that the FDA has taken a great deal of care in our review, and we encourage parents of children of any age who are eligible for primary vaccination or a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine booster dose to consider seeking vaccination now as it can potentially help protect them from COVID-19 during a time when cases are increasing,\u201d says Peter Marks, MD, PhD, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Behnoosh Afghani, MD, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at UCI Health, doesn\u2019t think parents should wait on boosting their kids, noting that booster doses of COVID vaccines have been shown to decrease disease severity in kids. \u201cBecause of the high prevalence of circulating COVID-19, it is important for the kids who qualify for the booster dose to get it as soon as possible.\u201d Dr. Afghani adds. If you have any questions about COVID vaccinations or boosters, make sure to discuss the decision with your child's pediatrician or another healthcare provider, especially if your child has any underlying medical conditions.",

        "title":"Latex Allergy Epidemic",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.quackwatch.org\/03HealthPromotion\/latex.html",
        "text":"During the past 15 years allergic reactions to latex have become a significant public health problem, particularly among health-care workers. Approximately 800,000 American adults and children have become allergic to natural rubber latex, found in gloves and pacifiers. When exposed to latex or latex dust, sensitized persons can develop hives, nasal and eye irritation, asthma, and anaphylaxis, a life-threatening condition in which the breathing passageways swell closed. About 1% of the general public and 4.5% to 17% of health-care workers and others exposed to latex on their jobs have become sensitized. Some have even been forced to terminate their careers for this reason. Medical and dental procedures on sensitized individuals may be complicated by anaphylactic events, as may the use of latex pacifiers by infants. The FDA has received more than 2000 reports of injury and several reports of death associated with latex allergy. In 1996, the agency published regulations that would require all latex-containing gloves and other devices to be labeled accordingly, including warnings about possible allergic reactions. Latex is a common component of disposable gloves, intravenous tubing, syringes, stethoscopes, catheters, dressings, bandages, and other medical supplies. Among health-care workers, gloves are the most significant source because they are frequently used, and the powder used to line some of them can absorb latex proteins and become airborne. Asthmatic reactions have occurred among people who did not use gloves but merely inhaled latex-containing dust. Thus, sensitive workers can be affected not only by their own gloves but also by those worn by co-workers. The surge of latex allergy among health-care workers is primarily attributable to greater use of disposable gloves to prevent the spread of AIDS and hepatitis B. Increased demand and cost pressures for gloves has led some manufacturers to shorten the manufacturing time by reducing the number of washing and purifying steps, which increases the amount of sensitizing protein that the gloves will transmit. The American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology has published guidelines and recommends that people who have been diagnosed as allergic wear an identification card (or bracelet) and a self-injectable adrenalin device. Sensitive individuals should be sure that their health-care providers are aware of their condition so that they are not exposed to latex during medical procedures or surgery. A few states have introduced bills to ban the use of powdered latex gloves in medical facilities. For Further Information",

        "text":"There certainly must exist an old English proverb warning, \u201cHe who carries coals to Newcastle runs grave risk of being burned.\u201d I must admit that I have felt uncomfortably warm of late in contemplating my presentation before this seminar, in which laetrile should constitute a principal ingredient of my remarks. Some of you have devoted weeks of your lives to concern over this unorthodox cancer treatment and have played major roles in helping the Commissioner prepare his decision on laetrile\u2019s status at the end of the rulemaking procedure called for by the 10th Circuit Court. This decision, published in the Federal Register on August 5, 1977 seems to me the most thorough, broad-gauged, and insightful analysis of a highly touted but ineffective product, the mode of its promotion, and the psychology of its acceptance that I have ever read. What then, in the company of you experts, can I say that will not seem oppressively like res adjudicata or d\u00e9ja vu? So as to gain what I hope may be a fresh perspective, let me try to differentiate between what might be called endemic and epidemic quackery, essaying some historical epidemiology to point to factors present when epidemics occur. Endemic quackery has existed in the world, to quote Voltaire, since the first knave met the first fool. As long as some diseases remain unconquered and death marks the certain terminus of our earthly pilgrimage, and as long as an ethical medical profession abstains from promising the impossible, the unscrupulous will boldly cater to our often desperate hopes. Therefore, a certain basic level of quackery, I take for granted, has existed in all places and at all times and is destined to continue. Occasionally, as one scans the past, he can detect an outburst of quackish energy that I should like to designate as an epidemic. Sometimes a single promotion achieves such a status. At other times the epidemic level consists of a congeries of separate ventures. Before getting to laetrile, let me discuss briefly one epidemic promotion and one epidemic period from the American past. In 1796, 180 years before the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, the federal government took perhaps its initial action regarding a medical device. In that year the government granted the first patent issued under the Consti\u00adtution in the area of health to a Connecticut physician for \u201cImproving Pain, Etc., by Metallic Points.\u201d Elisha Perkins\u2019 famous \u201ctractors\u201d furnished the new nation\u2019s first example of a health quackery epidemic. Always in such single-promotion epidemics, it seems to me, an ingenious promoter, or group of promoters, shrewdly devises and\/or luckily falls upon an approach that meshes with remarkable pertinence into key elements of the prevailing social climate. In Perkins\u2019 case these elements were fascination with electricity and cultural nationalism. A small-town country doctor probably trained by apprenticeship to his father, Perkins discovered that he could ease pains in various parts of his patients\u2019 bodies by drawing the blade of his penknife across the skin above the hurting parts and that he could relieve headaches by the ministration of a lacquered iron comb. He also observed that sometimes muscles contracted suddenly when touched during surgery by his knife. Knowing about Franklin and Mesmer, reading an account of Galvani\u2019s experiments, Perkins did what many would-be innovators before and since have done, he compressed what he had heard and observed into a simple theory. Almost all painful conditions, he concluded, especially gout, pleurisy, rheumatism, violent insanity, \u201cinflammatory tumors,\u201d and yellow fever, resulted from a surcharge of an electric fluid that accumulated in the bodily parts. This could be released by drawing a metal point across the afflicted surface, always moving from the center toward the extremities, thus ending pain and working a cure. Asserting in his letters the necessity and propriety of making money from his discovery- Perkins bad a family of ten children to support\u2013, this Yankee from the Nutmeg state shifted his therapeutic instrument from simple knife and comb to specially fabricated devices, a pair of small pointed metal \u201ctractors,\u201d called so because they pulled out pain. Made in a furnace in Perkins\u2019 home, the two tractors were composed of secret alloys, one gold in color, the other silver. In time, forgetting the knife and comb, Perkins insisted that only his patented points would work. Perhaps he became genuinely persuaded such was the case. In the history of quackery many schemers have become converts to the gospel of their own oratory. Perkins sold his tractors for $25 a pair, in his day a princely sum. Electricity was much in the air in the 18th century, and to posit an electrical cause for most diseases and a sort of miniature lightning rod cure struck the popular mind as both exciting and plausible. At least one testimonial, from a leading figure in the American Philosophical Society, compared Perkins\u2019 achievement favorably with Franklin\u2019s famous experiment and disparaged critics of Perkinism as similar to the English philosophers who had attacked the Philadelphia sage. This linkage with Franklin underlined the proud fact that Perkins\u2019 pur\u00adported breakthrough was an American discovery. In the aftermath of a successful Revolution, cultural nationalism blazed brightly in the new nation. Dr. Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and now the most distinguished physician in the land, argued that there existed in the United States twenty times more intellect and a hundred times more knowledge than there had been in the American colonies before the war. Could it not be, Perkins\u2019 champions queried jubilantly, that a nation which had provided the perfect example of freedom to the world might not also, through the metallic tractors, provide the means to universal health? Perkins\u2019 shrewd decision to get his tractors patented fit in neatly with this patriotic theme. In truth, patenting was still a very simple practice requiring no proof of an invention\u2019s utility, but a patent could easily appear to be a symbol of governmental backing, even the consummate testimonial to healing potency. Perkins took immediate steps to bolster this sentiment among potential customers. At the very time the state medical society in Connecticut was ousting him for having \u201cgleaned up\u201d his tractors \u201cfrom the miserable remains of animal magnetism,\u201d Perkins labored to find distinguished buyers in Philadelphia, the nation\u2019s capital. And he succeeded. Several members of the Congress acquired a pair. So did the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who wrote a letter praising the tractors to future Chief Justice Marshall. And a pair of the metallic points seems to have been bought by President Washington himself. With the three branches of the government thus leading the way, Americans engaged in a frenzy of \u201cgalvanizing trumpery.\u201d As these events demonstrate, Perkins had first-rank promotional talents. Prior to the tractors, he had added to his medical fees income secured from trading mules. His vigorous, magnetic personality certainly had much to do with both his therapeutic and his marketing successes. His series of testi\u00admonial pamphlets shows that Perkins worked as effectively in print as in face-\u00adto-face encounter. He gave tractors to some clergymen, along with a certificate saying they had bought them. And, despite their high cost, the metallic points sold well. An account suggests that people sold horses and carriages in order to buy them, and in one case a Southern plantation. Perkins countered the opposition of his erstwhile fellows in the Connecticut medical society as the unorthodox almost always do. He accused them of blind\u00adness and greed. And he pointed out that some physicians supported his discovery, despite \u201cmenaces\u201d from the stodgy establishment. Besides electrical wonder and cultural nationalism, a third factor in the climate of the 1790s may have aided Perkinism to reach epidemic proportions. This was fear of yellow fever. That dread disease appeared again and again during the decade, including devastating attacks on Northern cities. In the Philadelphia epidemic of 1793 Perkins himself had lost a daughter, son-in-law, and two grandchildren. So a special poignancy marks his inclusion of yellow fever among the ailments amenable to tractor treatment. And the surest proof that Perkins placed great faith in the efficacy of his patented points comes from his going to New York in 1799 when that city lay prostrate in the grip of yellow fever to treat the ill by plying his device. He could not save himself. He contracted the fever end died of it. Perkins\u2019 death ended the American boom. A British craze, perhaps even more frenetic, engineered by one of Perkins\u2019 sons, vanished when a provincial physician demonstrated that he could get just as enthusiastic patient response by using wooden tractors painted gold and silver as he could secure wielding the authentic patented points. Some writers, admitting Perkins\u2019 desire for money and his convenient forgetfulness about penknife and comb while later stressing that only the twenty-five dollar tractors possessed therapeutic efficacy, nonetheless wonder if it is appropriate to term him a quack. As his way of death demonstrates, they argue, he believed in his product, and therefore could not be a fraud. Does quackery require fraudulency? Does one \u201cknowingly\u201d have to sin or err in these matters to run afoul of the moral or statutory laws? Yes, said Congress in the 1912 Sherley Amendment. But I prefer But I prefer to stand with the 1938 law\u2019s negative, and even apply the principle retrospectively, granting some diffi\u00adculties as one moves backward in time and acknowledging, under this definition, that some \u201cquacks\u201d are more reprehensible than others. To pin down the term , social result as well as personal motive must be taken into account. To the patient-victim it makes no difference whether his self-asserted savior lies brazenly or speaks what he himself ignorantly believes to be the truth. The period I wish to point to in which no single promotion dominated but which saw the overall level of quackery reach epidemic proportions covers roughly the middle third of the 19th century. In many ways during these years the social fabric of the nation underwent fundamental change. Quacks and sectarians attuned to the new currents and maneuvering cleverly within their imperatives managed to flourish mightily. In its political dimension, the period began with Jacksonian democracy, which discredited an older elite leadership and broadened political power among the populace. In an intellectual sense during these years all branches of the educated establishment suffered widespread popular suspicion and scorn. \u201cThe priest, the doctor, and the lawyer,\u201d wrote an untutored New Englander, all stood convicted of \u201cdeceiving the people.\u201d Orthodox physicians learned nothing about the nature of medicine, he added, except \u201chow much poison . . . could be given without causing death.\u201d This jab at the heroic practice of the regulars had some pertinence~ and quacks were frequently to make it even while they themselves ladled out huge doses of opium and mercury. But it was the lofty status and established power of the educated which came espe\u00adcially under attack. The so-called state \u201cBla.ck Laws\u201d by rich orthodoxy sought to monopolize medical practice irked a growing breed of irregulars. \u201cWe go for free trade in doctoring,\u201d a Cincinnatian wrote in 1849; \u201cmedicine, like theology, should be divorced from the State, and . . . . as in the dif\u00adferent sects of religionists, the various medical systems . . . [should] be treated alike.\u201d Licensing laws were swept away, and Thomsonians, homeopaths, hydropaths, and almost anyone who wanted to could practice. The patent medicine side of quackery profited from other facets of burgeoning democracy, which expanded the newspaper press at the same time that it schooled more people to a level of literacy capable of reading the nostrum advertising which the new journals contained. In this atmosphere of freedom, as the common man increasingly made up his own mind about his health, he bought more patent medicines. The right of choice stimulates pride, fires ambition, but also provokes anxiety. Which of the many voices appealing for favor could best be believed? Hard, sharp, unscrupulous bargaining reigned in the realm of both thought and trade. Life became intensely competitive. Tricksters proliferated, and victimization was rampant. Everyone expected roguery, anticipated being cheated, himself sought to cheat in turn. Nor, within limits, did people mind being hoodwinked. They had made their own decisions, taken their chances in a free environment. Sometimes they were bound to lose. Indeed, clever imposture tended to amuse them. Such was the state of the popular mind as the sales of nostrums soared. This picture of the period emerges from Neil Harris\u2019 brilliant book on \u201cthe art of P. T. Barnum,\u201d titled Humbug. Coinciding with these complex aspects of freedom\u2019s ferment, the arrival of the romantic movement also helped quackery along. A romantic climate, Grete de Francesco has written, favors \u201call sorts of nature cures\u201d and \u201cthe development of a new kind of imposture: a falsification of Nature through overemphasis on the natural.\u201d All over America, as vell as in Europe, lay healers in rustic settings employed a variety of \u201cnatural\u201d remedies, water being especially prominent. Among those bemoaning the increasing artificiality of life, a preoccupation began with the \u201cnatural\u201d diet. Not that critique of the normal diet was not deserved. But some sages went much further. Sylvester Graham plotted a dietary regimen that he hoped might restore the pristine conditions and the purity of life in the Garden of Eden. Graham\u2019s ideas influenced the doctrines of new religions, the prescriptions of unorthodox physicians, and the promotions of patent medicine vendors. Please do not get the idea that I am decrying democracy, freedom, and romanticism because they provided an environment in which clever promoters could manipulate such currents so as to produce an epidemic of quackery. It is Just my hope, of course, to use history to help reveal the dynamism of a perennial threat. So far I have spoken of pre-germ theory days when the yardstick of orthodoxy could not by the nature of things measure quackery with the precision of our own times. Therefore, it is a paradoxical phenomenon deserving our earnest scrutiny that probably the single quackery promotion receiving the largest amount of public attention in all our nation\u2019s history should be one of our own day. What mesh of elements from the social climate and maneuvers by its promoters explain the sensational epidemic of laetrile? Basic, of course, are both the facts and the image of cancer in our society. With the decline of contagious diseases as a cause of death, due to sanitation, vaccines, and chemotherapy, cancer has risen to second place in the mortality lists. The 1900 death rate from malignant neoplasms was 64 per 100,000 deaths, the 1969 rate 160. On the disease and death front then, cancer and its mortality, have moved more to the center of public attention. In light of chemo\u00adtherapeutic miracles, the public wonders uneasily, why can\u2019t there be such a miracle involving cancer? This sense of urgency transmits itself to the Congress which allocates more money which, in turn, increases preoccupation with the disease. Yet the image of cancer may be an even more important force for quackery than its factual circumstances. Heart deaths exceed cancer deaths, but no waves of unorthodox cardiovascular cure-alls have surfaced similar to those in the cancer field, although perhaps obesity remedies may contain an element of this. All diseases possess a popular image. A sports columnist wrote recently that, as a boy, O J. Simpson suffered from rickets, which made him bow-legged and pigeon-toed and forced him to wear his shoes on the wrong feet. In college O.J. told his friends that he had been attacked by polio, because he considered polio a much classier disease than rickets. Through most of history the big killers have been pneumonias and gastro\u00adintestinal disorders, taken for granted by the populace because so common and familiar. What brought panic were diseases that caused less loss of life overall, but killed swiftly and painfully when they did come in epidemics, diseases possessing horrible external lesions, like smallpox, cholera, and the yellow fever which Elisha Perkins sought to cure. The fear of leprosy also greatly exceeded its morbidity. Syphilis, in English Restoration drama, was a subject of stock humor: the saddle nose, the falling hair, the aching bones brought gales of laughter from the audience as characteristics of the combatant who had lost in Venus\u2019 wars. In the romantic 19th century, syphilis ceased to be a hilarious disease and became a moral cataclysm. Under the romantic impact, tuberculosis gained the distinction of being the ennobling way to die. Lesions were hidden inside the body. As the consumptive wasted away, his mind was said to become more ethereal and spiritual as he gradually ascended toward his heavenly reward. Nor was this vision a male prerogative: recall the heroines of all these tragic operas.Indeed, for both men and women, a sort of tubercular standard of beauty came to prevail. If one could not achieve the proper paleness, frailness, and slenderness by contracting the disease, diet might lead to the desired result. Published beauty counsel suggested banning butter, cream, milk, cheese, fish, and vegetables. Sometimes small doses of arsenic were prescribed. These examples illustrate how the image of a disease can have a powerful influence on conduct. [After drafting this paper I was intrugued to find a more elaborate discussion of the disease theme in the current (January 26) issue of the New York Review of Books. I direct your attention to Susan Sontag\u2019s most perceptive analysis called Illness as Metaphor] That centuries ago cancer began to acquire a hostile and terrifying image may be deduced from the fact that the word \u201ccancer\u201d itself derives from the Greek word for crab. The crawling spread of cancer, gradual but relentless, whether exteroal and observable or internal and secretive, through the centuries appeared to be, and indeed a.mounted to, a sentence of death. This image hangs on, a powerful force in men\u2019s minds, a force not adequately updated by the victories orthodoxy increasingly has won. No doubt orthodoxy\u2019s message, ever more encouraging but never completely reassuring, cannot hope to compete with the frenzied fear, deeply embedded in the folk tradition and constantly revivified by the camp meeting oratory of orthodoxy\u2019s opponents. Here is Harry Hoxsey writing two decades ago on page 1 of his book entitled You Don\u2019t Have to Die: \u201cSuppose you suddenly discovered that you have cancer. A horrible crab-like disease has invaded your body, is gnawing your flesh, has pushed greedy tentacles into your vital organs. A loathsome scavenger slowly and inexorably is consuming you alive, cell by cell.\u201d And, of course, the unorthodox make orthodox weapons against the disease seem as terrifying as the disease itself. It was a laetrile champion who recently spoke scornfully of regular medicine\u2019s \u201ccutting, burning, and poisoning.\u201d The assertiveness of the cancer theme among the varieties of quackery available preceded the laetrile epidemic. In recent years, as Wallace Janssen has so vividly pointed out in FDA Consumer, the names of Koch and Hoxsey and the brand name Krebiozen have achieved high public recognition. Besides cancer\u2019s image as an element of popular culture helping explain the laetrile boom, other facets of the broad climate are involved. The whole trend of 20th century thought, for example, has brought us to new and gloomy versions of romanticism. As our century opened, the prevailing mood was cheerful and so hopeful about the future that progress seemed inevitable. Science had much to do with this, having revealed a comfortable, homey universe working by natural laws. The methods of science seemed transferable to the study of social situations, offering the prospect of resolving society\u2019s strains. Morality was palpable; people discussed all questions in moral terms with nary a blush. Americans as openly esteemed patriotism as morality, antici\u00adpating a great future destiny for the nation. Leaders were generally esteemed. Goodness marked basic human nature, and man\u2019s transgressions resulted not from evil but from error. Education would eliminate error, as technology would banish poverty. One seer welcomed the new century by taking material progress for granted, then adding: \u201cLaws are becoming more just, rulers humane; music is becoming sweeter and books wiser; homes are happier, and the individual heart becoming at once more just and more gentle.\u201d Things did not continue quite along this line. Relativity and indeter\u00adminacy replaced certainty in science, and the fixity of other 19th century solids also dissolved, including morality. Inevitable progress fell under the impact of a series of terrible wars. The inherent goodness of human nature, battered by new schools of philosophy, crumbled under the revelations from the German concentration camps. The belief in education as a social panacea withered. Science-technology inventiveness did continue to produce wondrous products for mankind\u2019s benefit, but also devised nuclear weapons and polluted the atmosphere. A kind of confident, reasonable, cheerful 19th century syn\u00adthesis gradually came apart, as the 13th century Thomistic synthesis broke up in the 14th century. At this juncture we cannot detect a new Renaissance that might re-establish a common confidence and faith. Rather the omens are disheartening. A whole host of new religions have sprung up seeking to win the adherence of distraught humankind. As in the 14th century, some of them seem diabolical. Since modern urban industrial civilization strikes many people as part of the problem, some disturbed souls strive to return to nature. Pressing upon this long developing major crisis of belief came Vietnam,. an unpopular, unsuccessful var that put generations at each other\u2019s throats, and Watergate, a seeming indisputable proof of what some voices had long been crying, that blame for discontents could be laid upon leadership. In my bones, I feel sure that such a setting as I have quickly sketched provides an atmosphere for the flourishing of quackery. Those questing for new faith are terribly vulnerable to false prophets. The widespread distrust of established authorities encompasses those who traditionally have sought to protect the public from charlatanry. The medical profession su1\u2019fers sus\u00adpicion, including the specialists within it concerned with cancer. In the behavioral survey of health practices and opinions sponsored by the FDA and six other federal agencies and released five years ago, it was concluded that 42% of American adults would not be persuaded by almost unanimous expert opinion that a purported \u201ccancer cure\u201d held out false hope. And, of course, distrust of authority also encompasses regulatory agencies. The major explanation for the epidemic proportions achieved by laetrile, it seems to me, lies in the shrewdness with which its proponents have recog\u00adnized these factors I have been discussing in the cultural environment and the skill with which they have exploited them. Misused authority constitutes oppression, and the opposite of oppression is freedom. If, in these parlous times, you can sell a panicked cancer sufferer and his family on the concept, not only that you have a treatment that will do some good, but also, that in accepting the treatment they are taking, in a confused immoral world, a nobly moral stand for an ancient and patriotic virtue, are joining a crusade for freedom itself, If you can do this, I say you are in business. The pitch may even seem persuasive to state legislators and federal judges. A radical right-wing reaction to our time of troubles, a movement opposing the initiatives of modern government, seems to be. a growing phenomenon. The adherence of such true believers to the ranks of laetrile promoters has unquestionably helped the movement grow. Some leaders of the Committee for Freedom of Choice in Cancer Therapy may have profited from the marketing of laetrile as part of their motivation, but there exists unquestionably a massive component of the zeal of the doctrinaire. Frank Salaman, one of the founders of the group, sees \u201cat stake\u201d a \u201cstrong principle of human freedom from uncon\u00adstitutional interference.\u201d And the pro-laetrile film strip \u201cWorld without Cancer\u201d opened with the deceptively disarming words, \u201cWe are not prescribing any course of treatment. We endorse nothing but freedom of choice.\u201d Freedom of access to worthless cancer treatments, as I wrote in my affi\u00addavit submitted to the rulemaking proceeding, \u201cleads only [backward] toward the license of those ancient days, when \u2018the toadstool millionaires,\u2019 preaching religion and spouting patriotism, operating without restraint, fleeced and often killed their gullible victims. That is a fate from which seven decades of constructive legislation, beginning . . . [in] 1906, has somewhat rescued the nation. Complex, modern, industrial, urbanized society, with standards of medical judgment far more precise than those existing in the 19th century, cannot afford to let the nation\u2019s health be governed by a distorted definition of that great symbol, \u2018freedom,\u2019 which would return piratical anarchy to the realm of health.\u201d Legalizing laetrile, I fear, would breach the dike of the new drug efficacy provisions of the 1962 law in a most ominous way. An additional major force lofting laetrile to epidemic proportions, it seems to me, is another kind of alliance formed by its promoters. I don\u2019t know how firm structural links may be, but in developing political action procedures laetrile\u2019s champions have sat at the feet of the health food lobby. And, of course, whatever its earlier purported modes of biochemical functioning, laetrile finally became\u00b7 transmuted into a vitamin. In testifying last July before Senator Kennedy\u2019s Subcommittee on Health, Ernst Krebs, Jr. called laetrile \u201ca scientific revolution as profound as the germ theory of disease . . . [and] the Copernican theory.\u201d What Vitamin C is to scurvy, niacin to pellagra, and Vitamin D to rickets, he suggested, Vitamin B-17 is to cancer. If every American took laetrile regularly, Dr. John Richardson told the same hearing,\u201d in 20 years cancer would be relegated to the dusty pages of history.\u201d Converting laetrile into a vitamin must have seemed like a master stroke. Not only would it put the product under the food rather than the drug provisions of the national law, it would also broaden the market by giving a more plausible explanation for preventive therapy. Moreover, in light of folk attitudes, it would wrap the product in a glamorous cloak. For the word \u201cvitamin,\u201d for reasons both sound and illegitimate, holds high esteem. The survey of health practices and opinions, already referred to, revealed that three out of four .Americans cherish the magical belief that, no matter how sufficient their diets, taking extra vitamins automatically provides more energy and pep. This myth of superhealth from vitamins stands ready to piggyback other health claims. The survey revealed another telling point. Whereas in most aspects of self-treatment, no coherent body of theory underlies consumer action, which is motivated by what the study called \u201crampant empiricism,\u201d in the vitamin and health food area a different set of circumstances prevails. Here alone something like an organized rationale underlies conduct, one based on the premise that the normal food supply, because of inadequacies and introduced poisons, threatens health rather than promoting it, requiring supplements to save the day. This myth has been the deliberate and successful creation of the health food industry, especially since enactment of the 1938 law, fabri\u00adcated out of food folklore running back to the dawn age of man, of clever leger\u00addemain involving complex scientific nutrition, and of some true and scary episodes relating to standard foods. Linking in to the power of this myth could only aid in laetrile\u2019s popular acceptance. The health food leaders have excelled at employing the modern mass media to disseminate their nutritional fairy tales. \u201cIn effect,\u201d as Stephen Barrett has put it, \u201cthe media have become the label,\u201d but a label so detached from the packaging as seldom to be actionable. Promoters of dubious nutritional wares have also proved to be amazingly skillful at mobilizing those whom they had converted into a powerful political force. The Vitamin Amendments of 1976 attest to this skill. In their efforts to thwart the FDA\u2019s regulatory goals, even to reduce the agency\u2019s statutory power, the health food industry pioneered in waving the flag of freedom against bureaucratic oppression. Their literature appealed to Washington and Lincoln, asserting \u201cThey Too Fought for Freedom Against Great Odds. \u201cSurely these vitamin freedom shouters furnished an example in doctrine for those proclaiming the riskier freedom of treating cancer with the specious vitamin B-17. Pseudo-nutritionists have also shown laetrile leaders how to turn converts to their therapeutic doctrines into political shock troops. Evidences exist of cooperative interaction between the National Health Federation, one of the health food industry\u2019s major pressure groups, and laetrile\u2019s supporters. At NHF conventions, pro-laetrile movies have been shown. An NHF governor has edited pamphlets espousing laetrile, and the president of one of the laetrile sponsoring organizations, the Cancer Control Council, has served on the NHF governing board. The NHF Bulletin has boosted laetrile. So it is not surprising that their respective patterns of drum beating, in\u00adcluding political lobbying, should resemble each other. In a democracy, of course, representative bodies chosen by the electorate make the rules, including those relating to highly complex scientific matters. I am an admirer of William Lowrance\u2019s book entitled Of Acceptable Risk, Science and the Determination of Safety, the result of an inquiry by the Committee on Science and Public Policy of the National Academy of Sciences. In essence, he concludes that in making public policy regarding matters of potential danger to society, the assessment of hazard is a scientific decision made by the experts, whereas the determination of risk is a political decision made by elected officials. Public opinion supported the enactment of food and drug laws, and those laws sought to remove from day-in, day-out legislative deter\u00admination highly complex particular questions, giving such decisions to expert agencies with rules of procedure defined in the laws. For legislatures to abandon this established tradition and rule on issues ad hoc seems to me highly unwise social policy, although of course legislatures possess the inherent power to do so. It is an indication of the epidemic levels of nutritional and cancer quackery that, in the federal and state areas respectively, enough pressure has been generated to cut back on the established pattern as well as on the rigor of regulation. Sometimes, in short, when shrewdly propagandized, a major segment of public opinion can be led to support a stand contrary to the conclusions of reputable scientists. And the issue may become emotional enough to make an impact on legislative bodies. \u201cCongress will rely on science when it can,\u201d the counsel for the House Health Subcommittee said recently, but in order for scientists to persuade legislators, they must convince the American people. This means a battle for minds, and for wills too, the will to let legis\u00adlators know convictions held. Champions of the unorthodox, for reasons I have sought to explain, bubble over with aggressive zeal. Opponents of the unorthodox on scientific grounds often act with greater diffidence. And when they do act, to many people they only confirm the distrust in which they already are held. Medical societies have not waged such effective battles against quackery recently as earlier in the century; indeed, the American Medical Association disbanded its anti-quackery machinery. Few local groups have demonstrated the vigor and imagination of Stephen Barrett\u2019s Lehigh Valley Committee Against Health Fraud, among whose anti-quackery ventures the preparation of an excellent book, The Health Robbers, aimed at a broad readership, ranks high in public service. The American Cancer Society has striven to alert the public to the dangers of unproven methods. With respect to laetrile, the Food and Drug Administration has assumed the role of primary educator to the nation, in connection with the agency\u2019s legal actions and in a more general sense as well. In testimony before legislative committees, press releases, the pages of FDA Consumer, legal briefs, and a widely distributed poster, the FDA has striven to alert the public to laetrile\u2019s dangers. In the perspective of history, I trust the agency will receive for this service the credit it deserves. In light of what I have said earlier about our intellectual environment, I believe all foes of quackery have reason to remain alert. A recent student of Elisha Perkins\u2019 career, Jacques Quen, points to the fact that Perkins\u2019 physician critics, in condemning him, did not pose for themselves a further question. Why did the metallic tractors evoke such a satisfied, indeed ecstatic response from those who used them for their pains? Now, 180 years later, a much better understanding prevails of the placebo effect. And the Commissioner\u2019s report contains some intriguing efforts to explain the motivation of laetrile\u2019s users and proselytizers. Yet do we know enough? Is this not a field requiring more research? Would there not be value in seeking to balance Dr. Richardson\u2019s Laetrile Case Histories with another set, revealing not only the physiological circumstances, but as fully as might be, the psychological parameters of laetrile users, not only including the disillusioned, but the most buoyant of champions? Difficult as this task might be, I believe the results might prove to be useful on both the educational and the regulatory fronts against threats from other quackery epidemics in the years ahead. James Harvey Young (1915-2006), a professor of history at Emory University, was a social historian whose special interest was the development of food and drug regulation in America. He was a member of the FDA National Advisory Food and Drug Council. His books, The Toadstool Millionaires, The Medical Messiahs, and American Health Quackery, trace the history of quackery in America and efforts to control it. This paper was presented at an FDA Bureau of Drugs seminar in Rockville, Maryland, on January 17, 1978.",

        "link":"https:\/\/blogs.biomedcentral.com\/bugbitten\/2022\/09\/02\/bill-gates-suggests-sensible-technical-steps-to-prevent-the-next-pandemic\/",
        "text":"I was recently traveling abroad with family this summer. Two days after arrival, we woke up with sore throat and fever, having contracted COVID-19. I obviously overestimated the immune protection provided by two doses of mRNA vaccine, and previous exposures, and underestimated the infectiousness of this pathogen, and made the mistake of not wearing a mask during our transcontinental trip. Fortunately, none of us ended up in the hospital or worse, but we had to spend a week out of our trip in isolation. Quite ironically, I spent some of this time reading the book I took with me, titled \u201cHow to Prevent the Next Pandemic\u201d by Bill Gates. I found this book to be interesting and useful, and I learned quite a few interesting tidbits. It\u2019s style is easy to understand, and mostly avoids hard-to-understand jargon. There are valid and clear, if simplified, descriptions of acquired immunity and the regulatory processes of both vaccinations and therapeutic drugs. I have never thought about the differences in regulations between these two sets of pharmaceuticals, but it makes sense that vaccines need to be regulated even more stringently as they are administered to healthy as opposed to already sick people. True to Bill Gates as a technologist, the book provides many descriptions of different technologies that have great potential to improve pandemic prevention and response, such as the Nexar high-throughput PCR machine that can process 150,000 test per day. He does spend a bit too much emphasis on technological solutions for my taste, and not enough on the sociological, cultural, political and philosophical issues that are crucial to understand to see if people would be even comfortable using the technologies, but that\u2019s not surprising coming from him. He expresses deep support for disease modeling as a tool and profession, which makes sense given how the Institute for Disease Modeling is part of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and funded the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. An entire chapter of the book focuses on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as masks and social distancing, and provides many good ideas, but also talks about the drawbacks of some interventions, such as border closures and the impact of school closures on the socio-psychological development of children. It was interesting to see that, despite his personal role in the development of personal computers, Bill Gates does not advocate for a widespread shift to online learning, and acknowledges the importance of in-person teaching and interactions for students of all ages. However, in the Afterword, he focuses on how the world of work may change during and after the pandemic, with increased options for remote work across large sectors of industry. The main idea of the book is presented in Chapter 2, and subsequent chapters provide supporting evidence for this main idea. Bill Gates advocates for the creation of a global pandemic prevention team, which he calls GERM (Global Epidemic Response and Mobilization), whose purpose would be to make sure the world is ready for the next outbreak, and improve pandemic preparedness globally. The idea is loosely based on existing teams organized to coordinate polio surveillance and vaccination in endemic countries, called Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs). While these EOCs are focused on polio, they can be reoriented and repurposed to focus on an emerging pandemic pathogen, such as SARS-CoV-2, or Ebola virus previously. GERM would be under the mandate of WHO, and would only require $1 billion a year to employ a staff of 3,000 to coordinate pandemic surveillance and preparedness at a global level. While we might assume this is already happening at WHO, that is not the case, according to Gates, and WHO does not have the required funding for such a program at sufficient scale. He does mention GOARN (the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network) as the most similar existing system, but it is functioning on a volunteer basis. I was surprised and disappointed that he did not mention or include ProMed, where at least I saw the first report on what later turned out to be the COVID-19 pandemic, so then I\u2019m not sure what else is there that he might not be aware of. In general, I found the idea of GERM to be interesting, and would definitely improve our pandemic preparedness, but it makes me wonder why we didn\u2019t have it previously. The WHO is notoriously underfunded, and individual countries are unlikely to take kindly to interference from a WHO team into their own internal surveillance and pandemic preparedness. I even wonder if some countries would be reluctant to share information publicly on their pandemic preparedness (or lack thereof) to shield it from their adversaries. However, if anyone, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation does have the deep pockets to get such a team going, even on their own, and once it\u2019s value is demonstrated, perhaps the WHO or other countries would pick up the tab. One interesting tidbit in the book had to do with the ethical issues surrounding the Seattle Flu Study and their detection of SARS-CoV-2 on tests taken for other purposes in February 2020. Without getting into much detail, the Seattle Flu Study was established (as it\u2019s name suggests) to collect samples for influenza surveillance and genomic sequencing in the Seattle area. When COVID-19 started spreading in the US, some of the scientists made their own in-house PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2, and ran some of the samples collected to test for the flu for this new pathogen instead. The ethical dilemma struck when one of their samples came back positive. Genetic analysis suggested that the virus they sampled and sequenced was related to the virus in the first COVID-19 patient detected in the US in the Seattle area, and that many times more people were actually infected (and potentially infectious) than the known number of cases in the area. The ethical dilemma was that the samples were collected to test for the flu, not SARS-CoV-2, and that the in-house PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was only approved for research, not for medical diagnostic purposes. Nonetheless, the researchers went ahead with announcing their discovery, making all of us (including myself) suddenly aware that this pandemic is already out-of-control in February. This led to a cascade of decisions such as closing campuses before the end of Winter quarter, protecting untold numbers of people from getting infected. While this made Trevor Bedford one of my personal heroes, it was quite interesting to read the backstory I didn\u2019t know in this book. One of the other interesting ideas that Bill Gates argues in this book is that preparing for the next pandemic and dealing with current problems is not contradictory but complimentary. There have been a lot of coverage (including here at Bugbitten) on how shifting focus and resources to COVID-19 took away those same resources from endemic chronic conditions such as HIV, malaria, TB and many others. Gates argues that should not necessarily be the case, and that pandemic preparedness (as opposed to response) can also benefit local health systems, such as increasing routine surveillance and monitoring. Gates also decries the lack of good preparation for pandemics, in contrast to e.g. armed conflict, and that very few countries (e.g. Vietnam) choose to spend time and money on conducting full-fledged pandemic simulations that would reveal flaws and lead to improvements. Most countries (including the United States) stop at conducting table-top exercises, which don\u2019t lead to improved outcomes, even tough they already reveal dysfunction on delegating roles and responsibilities (e.g. between the states and the federal government). He also focuses on closing the gap between rich and poor countries in health outcomes and vaccine coverage, and provides good evidence of the enormous progress that has been achieved (with partly his help) in the last 50 years. He makes good arguments for making plans to prevent pandemics, focusing on four steps, which are (1) making and delivering better tools; (2) building the GERM team; (3) Improving disease surveillance; and (4) strengthening health systems. Being quite self-aware, he talks about how he seems to always write about the current big problem, providing suggestions for problems where he might not be the expert. He states that for the moment, he only sees climate change and pandemic risk as the two most important problem of our time. However, unfortunately he does not connect the two, as climate change can and does lead to an increased risk of pandemics. Finally, he argues that we shouldn\u2019t let society and policy-makers forget about the COVID-19 pandemic, as we did after the 1918 Spanish flu, but instead learn from the mistakes we made and be better prepared for the next one. As part of that preparation, I can wholeheartedly recommend his book on \u201cHow to Prevent the Next Pandemic\u201d.",

        "text":"Save CDC recommends bivalent COVID-19 boosters The CDC\u2019s vaccine advisory committee on Thursday voted to recommend the bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccines authorized this week by the FDA that also target the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. In two separate votes, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted 13-1 to recommend the bivalent boosters made by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, and to appeal previous recommendations for their monovalent booster shots. The ACIP voted to recommend the updated COVID-19 booster vaccines that contain a component targeting the omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5. Source: Adobe Stock. Specifically, the recommendations say people aged 12 years or older can receive the Pfizer-BioNTech booster and adults aged 18 years or older can receive the Moderna booster, as long as it has been at least 2 months since they completed their primary series or received their most recent booster shot. CDC Director Rochelle P. Walensky, MD, MPH, later signed off on the recommendations, making them official. Both of the messenger RNA vaccines combine the companies' original vaccines with another component targeting the omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants \u2014 which the FDA noted on Wednesday is expected to circulate this fall and already accounts for all but 0.2% of new infections in the U.S, according to the CDC. Numerous ACIP members voiced concern about voting on the bivalent boosters without any available human clinical data. Although studies on the bivalent boosters are underway, the data presented during Thursday\u2019s ACIP meeting were from research that used mice and studies of different bivalent vaccines containing earlier omicron subvariants. Both \u201cno\u201d votes were made by Pablo J. S\u00e1nchez, MD, a physician and professor of pediatrics at The Ohio State University and Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital, who said he thought the votes were \u201ca bit premature\u201d given the lack of human clinical trial data. \u201cIt\u2019s a new vaccine, it\u2019s a new platform. There\u2019s a lot of hesitancy already. We need the human data,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cHaving said that, I\u2019m comfortable that the vaccine(s) will be safe like the others.\u201d Sarah S. Long, MD, professor of pediatrics at Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia, said she voted to recommend the bivalent boosters \u201cconsidering and hoping that the advantages will outweigh any risks that we do not yet anticipate.\u201d This vote came 1 day after the FDA authorized the bivalent boosters for emergency use in the United States and roughly 2 months after the FDA voted in favor of adding an omicron component to COVID-19 boosters. \u201cWith FDA\u2019s regulatory action approving the bivalent booster yesterday, we have an opportunity to update and simplify our recommendations for vaccine use,\u201d Melinda Wharton, MD, MPH, associate director for vaccine policy at the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during Thursdays ACIP meeting. She added that updating the recommendations will be a transition and that \u201cthere will be some bumps in the road,\u201d but that it is an important move toward simpler recommendations and an updated vaccine that she expects will provide broader protection. Sara Oliver, MD, MPH, head of the ACIP\u2019s COVID-19 vaccines work group and medical officer in the in the Division of Viral Diseases, summarized data from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna showing that bivalent boosters appear to provide protection from omicron sublineages, provide a more diverse response overall and could likely improve the response to future variants. Oliver presented positive data from Pfizer and Moderna studies on their bivalent booster shots containing an omicron BA.1 component that showed the boosters increased immune responses in people who had completed a primary series and received a previous booster. Oliver added, however, that there is still a lot to learn about the bivalent vaccines, including rates of myocarditis following vaccination, although she said it is unlikely that the inclusion of an omicron component would increase myocarditis rates. In a presentation, Elisha Hall, PhD, the CDC\u2019s clinical guidelines lead, said providers should offer all available vaccines \u2014 including influenza vaccines and COVID-19 boosters \u2014 to eligible patients during the same visit.",

        "title":"Ethical Anguish in a Time of COVID-19",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.insidescience.org\/news\/ethical-anguish-time-covid-19",
        "text":"Around the world, physicians at overwhelmed hospitals may have to decide who will not get treated during the pandemic. Joel Shurkin, Contributor (Inside Science) -- For almost a month, Lombardy, the prosperous, mountainous section of northern Italy, has been the world\u2019s hotspot for COVID-19, the severe respiratory pandemic now raging in cities like New York and around the globe. The Italians were unprepared. So is the U.S. Italy\u2019s excellent universal health care system is now in danger of crashing. Doctors there are facing stunning existential decisions: Who will they treat, and who will they let die? Hospital capacity is overwhelmed and medical staff are falling ill from the virus. They simply can\u2019t treat everyone. In a pandemic, the standard rules of medicine no longer apply, and health care providers in the U.S., including those in Detroit and New York, either are now facing or may soon face the same conundrum. The pandemic hit Italy quietly. On Jan. 30, a Chinese couple from Wuhan were admitted to a hospital in Rome that specializes in infectious diseases. The authorities identified the disease and quickly acted to ban any flights from Wuhan to Italy. Italians in Wuhan were repatriated home and a few of them were also found to have the virus. Not much was made of the finding because the original site of contracting the virus was easily identified. About three weeks later, Giulio Gallera, Councilor for Welfare in Lombardy, announced that Mattia, a 38-year-old Italian from the region had been hospitalized for pneumonia and tested positive for the coronavirus. He had not been to China or in contact with anyone who had. The virus was loose in the region. As of March 27, the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center reported that Italy had recorded 86,498 cases of COVID-19 infection and that 9,134 people had died. In mid-March, Italy had approximately 6,000 intensive care beds, a number reached in part by switching regular hospital rooms to ICU rooms and hospital beds to ICU beds, a process that takes several hours and sometimes days. The country aims to increase ICU capacity to 9,000 beds. Many more people may need hospitalization in Lombardy alone. Ventilators are crucial to saving desperately ill patients. Doctors use these mechanical breathing machines when a patient is unable to breathe enough on their own. When a ventilator is removed from a patient who has not recovered, the patient can suffocate. At some hospitals, staff are attempting to alter other devices to make more respirators, such as repurposing SCUBA masks and adapting tubing to use one ventilator for more than one person, among other techniques. In one of the first large-scale studies of the characteristics of the coronavirus in Wuhan, 5% of patients required the intensive care unit, and 2.3% required ventilation. When the number of patients who need care exceeds the capacity of the health care system to provide that care at the medically advisable level, the only immediate solution is rationing. Fifty years ago, doctors in the U.S. could be charged with crimes for rationing health care, said Thomas Raffin, former associate director of the intensive care unit at Stanford University hospital and a bioethicist. It was considered murder or manslaughter. Treating everyone equally was a matter of law and ethics. Even when survival chances were uncertain, the ethical and legal mandate was to continue treatment. The use of the word triage (a French word) in medical contexts comes from the military in the 19th and early 20th centuries. During wartime, injured solders brought into a hospital were quickly categorized into three groups: the ones who obviously could be saved, the ones who had 50-50 odds, and those who probably couldn\u2019t be saved. The first group got immediate treatment, said Raffin. The third category was left to die. Triage for patients admitted to hospitals is typically necessary only when medical resources are limited. What the Italian doctors describe is a lowering of standards, said Maurizio Cereda, professor of critical care at the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. If the hospital is short on resources, it is entirely possible that someone brought in with a heart attack or appendicitis may not receive treatment or may not be treated as well as they otherwise would. The same thing can happen with COVID-19 patients. Cereda said it is happening now in Italy, where heart attack patients sometimes die for lack of attention. \u201cThey are not able to be rescued because of a lack of equipment. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible. It\u2019s horrible,\u201d Cereda said. \u201cThey [the Italian doctors] will carry those scars forever.\u201d One way to ease the ethical problem for physicians is to use committees to make the decisions, taking the burden off individual doctors. In Italy, a set of rules newly formulated by the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) gives external support for the decision. Physicians can then follow the guidelines. The allocation criteria need to guarantee that those patients with the highest chance of therapeutic success will retain access to intensive care, the guidelines say. They then set an age limit, though it\u2019s not a hard and fast rule -- the physical condition of the patient would factor into it -- and came up with the age of 70. Patients over 70 could be unlikely to pass selection when the demand for ICU beds is too high. Hospitals would center their treatment on those patients who would live longest. This may sound cruel, but the alternative, the document argues, is no better. In American hospitals that become stressed, similar rules or guidelines will likely apply. If there is a 25-year-old cancer patient and a 60-year-old in good health, the hospital might choose the 60-year-old, said Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at the Grossman School of Medicine at New York University. \u201cSo it\u2019s not just age, but age usually correlates with the likelihood of benefit.\u201d said Caplan. Researchers at Harvard and Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, in an article in the New England Journal of Medicine, wrote that \u201cthe angst that clinicians experience when asked to withdraw ventilators for reasons not related to the welfare of their patients, should not be underestimated -- it may lead to debilitating and disabling distress for some clinicians.\u201d They suggest a committee make the decision. Who is going to tell the family? The Italian guidelines suggest that be done by volunteers or members of a triage committee and not the attending physician. These kinds of rationing approaches have rarely been seen in the U.S. since 1918 when a flu pandemic killed about 50 million people around the world. Yet as COVID-19 cases continue to soar, American hospitals are staring in the face of impending shortages of equipment and personnel.

        "text":"A vaccine could confer long-term protection even if a natural infection does not. Nala Rogers, Staff Writer (Inside Science) -- COVID-19 vaccines could provide stronger, longer-lasting immunity than recovering from the disease itself, say experts. Most people who recover from COVID-19 probably enjoy some degree of protection against getting the disease again. Both the strength of that protection and how long it lasts remain open questions, with the answers complicated by a mixture of conflicting evidence. Some studies suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 may interfere with immune memory, leaving people vulnerable to repeat infections months or years later. But even if that's true, there is no reason to think vaccines, once approved and available, would suffer from the same limitations. \"We're thinking that with the vaccines, we should be able to do better than nature,\" said Peter Doherty, a Nobel Prize-winning immunologist at the University of Melbourne's Doherty Institute in Australia. More COVID-19 reporting from Inside Science How Nobel-Winning Research is Helping Battle Covid-19 Fighting Misinformation About a Novel Disease Disgust Evolved To Protect Us From Disease. Is It Working? How the immune system remembers COVID-19 There are several ways the immune system can \"remember\" a virus after an infection has been vanquished. One involves B cells, which produce the virus-busting structures known as antibodies. Some B cells continue to produce antibodies even after an infection clears, while others linger in a dormant state until they are reactivated. Another type of immune memory involves killer T cells, which attack human cells that have been infected and turned into virus factories. Killer T cells reach their highest concentrations during infection, but a small population may remain for decades, ready to launch a faster response next time. New research that is not yet peer reviewed indicates B cell and T cell immunity may remain strong six months after infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But it's not clear how much longer that protection will last, and there are other studies suggesting that both types of immune memory may be impaired by the disease. \"What this virus is doing is in some way compromising aspects of our immune response,\" said Doherty. \"We do think long-term immunity following infection is problematic.\" In a study published last month in the journal Cell, researchers examined the lymph nodes of people who had died of COVID-19 and found they lacked structures called germinal centers. Germinal centers are where B cells mature into long-lived forms that produce better antibodies -- antibodies customized to bind strongly to a specific enemy. The process is similar to Darwinian natural selection, with B cells going through repeated rounds of genetic mutation. Mutated B cells that produce better antibodies are sent back to mutate again; B cells that produce worse antibodies die.

While the body can produce effective B cells without germinal centers, those B cells tend not to last as long as ones that have been through the germinal center process, said Shiv Pillai, director of the Immunology Graduate Program at Harvard Medical School, who conducted the study with his colleagues. If COVID-19 prevents people from forming germinal centers, said Pillai, that could mean people can only produce antibodies for a limited time after infection. The researchers could only examine lymph nodes from deceased people, so the germinal center problem might only crop up when illness is severe, noted Godelieve de Bree, an internist and infectious disease specialist at Amsterdam University Medical Centers in the Netherlands, who is studying COVID-19 antibodies. Immunologist Michel Nussenzweig at Rockefeller University in New York agreed, saying that findings from deceased patients do not necessarily indicate anything about people who recover. \"I think you see a problem with everything in people [who] are dying,\" said Nussenzweig. Further evidence leads to conflicting interpretations. Pillai noted that antibodies collected from COVID-19 patients during and soon after infection have few of the telltale mutations that would indicate they have been through germinal centers. That's true regardless of the severity of illness, suggesting that immune memory from B cells may be limited even in mild and moderate cases, according to Pillai. But Nussenzweig's team recently found evidence that mutation levels are higher six months after infection, suggesting that long-lived B cells may develop gradually after people are well. There are also hints that killer T cells may be impaired by COVID-19. In a study published in September in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers led by Katherine Kedzierska at the Doherty Institute found that killer T cell counts in COVID-19 patients didn't rise nearly as much as the researchers expected, and there was no sign that any remained after recovery to provide immune memory. Even at the height of infection, there were only a tenth as many killer T cells for the COVID-19 virus as a typical person has left over from influenza A infections sometime in the past. \"The killer T cell system in this virus seems to be compromised. It's not as good as it should be,\" said Doherty, who also took part in the study. He added that the study only looked at one of several types of killer T cells involved in COVID-19, and more research is needed. So how long can people who recover from COVID-19 expect to be protected? It's still unclear, and opinions are divided. Pillai suspects most COVID-19 patients will lose any protection they gained from B cells and antibodies within a year of recovery, and potentially sooner. De Bree thinks immunity may last around a year, as that's how long it lasts in other coronaviruses that cause seasonal colds. It's now clear that reinfections can happen. As of Nov. 11, there are 421 suspected and 25 confirmed cases of people being infected twice, according to a tracker maintained by the Dutch news organization BNO News. In most cases, the second illness has been mild or asymptomatic, but one man in Nevada came down with severe COVID-19 barely more than a month after recovering from a milder version. Nussenzweig noted that those reinfection numbers are low, considering the millions of people who have been infected. But with the pandemic less than a year old, it is still early days. \"I think it would be very important not to depend on getting immunity from being infected,\" said Pillai. Why a vaccine could be better than nature If it turns out that COVID-19 does leave people vulnerable after recovery, why should researchers expect a vaccine to provide longer-lasting protection? A few decades ago, they might not have. For diseases like measles, mumps and hepatitis B, all a vaccine has to do is mimic nature, since people naturally develop lifelong immunity after infection. But many viruses avoid or manipulate the immune system in ways that leave people open to repeat infections. Modern vaccine development aims to correct for such problems. \"Our goal in this case is to definitely do better than natural immunity,\" said Barney Graham, deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Graham helped isolate and stabilize the viral spike protein that is being used in many COVID-19 vaccine candidates, including the vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech that made headlines on Monday after the companies announced promising early results from a clinical trial. Graham's team is now collaborating with the biotechnology company Moderna on another COVID-19 vaccine candidate. One example of a vaccine that typically provides better immunity than a natural infection is the HPV vaccine, which protects against strains of human papillomavirus that cause cervical cancer. HPV spends most of its time hiding inside cells of the skin and the lining of the cervix without doing anything to draw the attention of the immune system, said Richard Schlegel, a virologist and pathologist at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, who helped develop the vaccine in the 2000s. In contrast, vaccination involves injecting viral proteins directly into the muscle, and from there the proteins spread throughout the body -- a challenge the immune system can't ignore. Afterward, the trained immune cells can recognize HPV proteins wherever they crop up, even in the tiny quantities produced by natural infections. COVID-19 presents a different set of challenges, including the possibility that the virus may be thwarting aspects of the immune system\u2019s memory. A vaccine may be able to get around this, researchers say. Many of the vaccine candidates don\u2019t use the whole virus, delivering instead a single viral protein or protein fragment to stimulate the immune system. Some vaccines deliver the protein directly, while others deliver a gene that induces the body to produce the protein in its own cells. Researchers might not understand exactly how SARS-CoV-2 manipulates the immune system, but it likely takes more than a single protein. \"We're taking away all those other viral genes that are probably screwing up the immune response,\" said Doherty. Many vaccines also include substances called adjuvants that enhance the immune response and guide it in certain directions, said Graham. And in some cases, vaccines can be delivered in multiple doses to further boost their effects. Even with such advantages, a COVID-19 vaccine probably won't make people completely immune for the rest of their lives. Graham expects vaccinated people will still be susceptible to infection, but will fight off such infections quickly, hopefully before feeling sick. Some people will probably still transmit the virus to others, but not as often. People may also need yearly booster shots. That may not sound like the magic bullet some people are hoping for. But if a vaccine can be proven safe and effective and made widely available, it could offer a path forward, out of a crisis that is still crippling economies and killing thousands of people around the world each day. \"Everything is telling us, if you want to be protected, whether you got infected or not -- please, get vaccinated,\" said Pillai.",

        "text":"The unprecedented pace of scientific progress on Covid-19 builds on groundbreaking discoveries from the past. A German caricature showing Emil von Behring extracting diphtheria antitoxin from a horse through a tap. Von Behring won the very first Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for his work on diphtheria antitoxin in 1901. Nala Rogers, Staff Writer (Inside Science) -- Today's Covid-19 researchers didn't start from scratch. Their rapid progress in understanding a disease that was unknown one year ago rests on over a century's worth of discoveries about viruses and the immune system. Next week, scientists in Sweden will announce new Nobel Prize winners in physiology or medicine. This year's winners will join an inspirational group whose work continues to shape science and society. Here's how some of those past Nobel-winning discoveries are contributing to the fight against the current pandemic. Discovering antibodies Emil von Behring won the very first Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1901 for his work on diphtheria, which killed so many children in the 19th century that it was called the \"strangling angel of children.\" Through a series of experiments on animals such as guinea pigs, von Behring found that individuals that had recovered from diphtheria held a miraculous cure in their blood. When he processed the blood to remove larger components like cells, the resulting serum could prevent other animals from contracting the disease and even cure ones that had been exposed to diphtheria toxin. Von Behring and his colleagues developed anti-diphtheria serum into a medicine that could be produced in large quantities in horses and used to save children's lives. His key collaborator Paul Ehrlich standardized the serum to ensure each dose had the same potency. Ehrlich also developed theoretical explanations for how it all worked. While Ehrlich was wrong about certain details, he correctly laid out the core of antibody-mediated immunity: Infection prompts cells to release defensive substances, or antibodies, which can destroy the particular pathogen or toxin that spurred their production. \"He made a science of it,\" said Arthur Silverstein, a retired immunologist who is now affiliated with the Department of the History of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. \"He really defined in better scientific terms what an antibody was and where it came from and how it worked.\" Ehrlich was awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1908. Image Paul Ehrlich working in his laboratory. Media credits The Wellcome Collection Media rights CC BY 4.0 Von Behring and Ehrlich's anti-diphtheria serum, known as diphtheria antitoxin, is essentially the same idea as the convalescent plasma being explored as a treatment for Covid-19. The main difference is that diphtheria antitoxin came from nonhuman animals, while convalescent plasma comes from humans. \"The logic is, 'that person recovered. They've got antibodies in them. I'm going to go get them,'\" said Timothy Block, president and CEO of the Hepatitis B Foundation and its Baruch S. Blumberg Institute, a nonprofit medical research organization. While diphtheria antitoxin was highly effective, the evidence that convalescent plasma helps against Covid-19 is mixed. Block believes it likely helps a subset of patients at certain disease stages, but it's not yet clear how to predict who will benefit from it. That's because Covid-19 is more complicated than diphtheria. Diphtheria is caused by a bacterium called Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and its harmful effects can be traced to a single toxin easily neutralized by antibodies. Covid-19 is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, which takes over human cells and wreaks havoc through multiple mechanisms that researchers are still struggling to understand. After developing diphtheria antitoxin, von Behring invented a vaccine by mixing diphtheria toxin and antitoxin together. The antitoxin neutralized the toxin and rendered it safe, and people's immune systems responded to the deactivated toxin by producing their own antibodies. Von Behring's mixture wasn't the first vaccine ever developed -- the smallpox vaccine had already been around for more than a century. But at that time, no one knew how the smallpox vaccine worked. Von Behring's approach was \"the start of rational vaccine design,\" said Stefan Kaufmann, an immunologist and infection biologist and founding director of the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Germany. Prompting patients' bodies to produce antibodies is still a primary goal of vaccine developers today, including those working on vaccines for Covid-19. Antibodies as tools Antibodies are also valuable as detection tools. A single type of antibody will only bind to a specific chemical target, and scientists can design antibodies to target almost any biological substance they want to study. Researchers use antibodies for everything from staining parts of cells on microscope slides to testing for diseases. Indeed, some Covid-19 screening tests use antibodies to detect whether a person has SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in their body. But many tests and experiments require pure samples containing only one type of antibody. A person's blood contains thousands of types of antibodies. Even a single disease can prompt the body to produce many types of antibodies, as each recognizes a different part of the disease-causing organism or its products. C\u00e9sar Milstein and Georges K\u00f6hler solved this problem in 1975. By that time, scientists knew that antibodies are produced by specialized cells called B cells, and each B cell makes only one type of antibody. But B cells don't survive long outside the body. To make antibody-producing cell cultures that could be grown in the lab and kept alive indefinitely, K\u00f6hler and Milstein fused B cells with cancer cells. The resulting \"hybridomas\" each produced a single type of antibody, or \"monoclonal antibody.\" The advance won them the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1984. \"It has totally revolutionized biology,\" said Pamela Bj\u00f6rkman, a structural immunologist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. \"We use monoclonal antibodies -- we and everyone else these days.\" (There are now several ways of making monoclonal antibodies, although the K\u00f6hler and Milstein method is still widely used.) Many new drugs are actually monoclonal antibodies. For example, the anti-arthritis drug Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that reduces inflammation by suppressing parts of the immune system. Some of the worst damage in Covid-19 is caused by out-of-control immune reactions called cytokine storms, and researchers are investigating whether Tocilizumab can halt these destructive spirals. Researchers are also developing monoclonal antibodies that attack SARS-CoV-2 itself. Bj\u00f6rkman's team is working to characterize antibodies from convalescent plasma, hoping to identify promising candidates to synthesize as drugs. Multiple drugs identified that way, such as REGN-COV2 and LY-CoV-555, are already in clinical trials. According to Bj\u00f6rkman, the most effective antibody treatments will likely combine several types of monoclonal antibodies that attack the virus in different ways. Killer T cells While antibodies are hugely important, they can only kill viruses that are floating free in the blood. Once a virus has entered a human cell, it becomes invisible to antibodies -- but not to killer T cells. Viruses take over the cells they infect, forcing them to churn out more viruses. Killer T cells attack these virus-infected cells. Like antibodies, killer T cells come in many varieties, each of which has its own specific target. \"The killer T cells are there to bump off damaged cells,\" said Peter Doherty, an immunologist at the University of Melbourne's Doherty Institute in Australia. \"They stop virus production -- kill the virus production factories.\" Image A microscope image showing a killer T cell (blue) attacking another cell. The cells are stained with fluorescent dyes that are bound to the cellular material using monoclonal antibodies. Media credits National Institutes of Health (NIH) via Flickr Media rights Public Domain Mark 1.0 By the early 1970s, researchers knew that killer T cells could destroy virus-infected cells. But they assumed T cells recognized infected cells in much the same way antibodies recognize viruses, perhaps by detecting newly produced viruses as they budded out from infected cells, said Doherty. With colleagues including Rolf Zinkernagel, Doherty discovered that killer T cells rely on a group of molecules called MHC class 1 proteins that stick out from the surfaces of cells. Killer T cells bind to these MHC proteins and use them to assess whether a cell is a healthy part of a person's own body. When a virus infects a cell, it alters the MHC proteins on that cell's surface. These altered MHC proteins then serve as cries for help, telling killer T cells that the cell has gone rogue and should be destroyed. This discovery explained why transplanted organs are often rejected, since killer T cells may perceive MHC proteins from another individual as \"altered\" or \"foreign.\" Later work revealed that there is a second group of T cells, now known as helper T cells, that regulate the immune system rather than attacking infected cells. Doherty and Zinkernagel won a Nobel Prize for their work on MHC proteins and T cells, also called T lymphocytes, in 1996. Now, that knowledge is part of the fight against Covid-19. \"It is important to have good antibodies. But I doubt that they will be sufficient,\" said Kaufmann. \"Ultimately, to combat a disease like Covid-19, you also need T lymphocytes.\" Most vaccine developers still focus primarily on antibodies, according to Doherty. T cell responses take a few days to ramp up, whereas antibodies have the potential to destroy invading viruses quickly, preventing infection from ever taking place. But respiratory viruses make challenging vaccine targets because it's hard to keep antibody levels high enough in the mucus that bathes the cells inside the nose, said Doherty. That's part of why flu vaccines are only about 40-60% effective at preventing illness. Researchers believe SARS-CoV-2 also starts out by infecting nasal tissues, so Doherty fears it could present some of the same problems. If a Covid-19 vaccine were to stimulate a strong T cell response, it wouldn't prevent infection, but it could help people clear the infection quickly, with less severe symptoms. There is no telling which of the many Covid-19 vaccine candidates will end up being most effective, said Doherty. But he thinks it\u2019s likely that the Moderna and Pfizer candidates, which use messenger RNA, will get especially good T cell responses. There are many more Nobel-winning scientists whose work is important to Covid-19 research, and even more whose contributions were never honored with Nobels. Ultimately, they were all part of the same vast team, advancing human knowledge and empowering today's scientists to tackle the present threat. \"Almost everybody who has worked in the field has contributed a little bit to the progress,\" said Silverstein. \"This is the nature of the history of any science: It's as much involved in the people we don't remember as in the people we do.\"",

        "text":"Vaccine authorization Vaccine authorization What processes are in place to ensure vaccine safety and effectiveness? Any vaccine candidate that is made available to the general public will first undergo safety and efficacy reviews by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA, the agency responsible for regulation of medical products in the United States, will conduct a rigorous review of the safety and efficacy data collected by vaccine manufacturers throughout clinical trials conducted this year. Additionally, there are two primary committees that will review vaccine safety and efficacy: COVID-19 vaccine: FAQs for physicians Find answers on vaccine safety, potential side effects and more. Download Now (PDF) The Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), which provides advice to the Commissioner of the FDA and evaluates data concerning safety, effectiveness and appropriate use of vaccines, for which the FDA has regulatory responsibility. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which provides advice and guidance to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ACIP provides recommendations on use of vaccines in the U.S. civilian population based on disease epidemiology, vaccine safety, vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, quality of evidence reviewed, economic analyses and implementation issues. The American Medical Association partnered with FDA and CDC for a series of webinars further outlining the vaccine development and review process. What information does FDA require of manufacturers to issue an \"Emergency Use Authorization\"? Data and information needed to support the issuance of an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by FDA were outlined in guidance from FDA entitled \"Emergency Use Authorization for Vaccines to Prevent COVID-19 (October 2020).\" The guidance discusses FDA's current thinking regarding the circumstances under which the issuance of an EUA would be appropriate including the safety and efficacy data to support an EUA. Data to support an EUA request for an investigational COVID-19 vaccine that must be submitted to FDA include the following: Chemistry, manufacturing and controls information Nonclinical data and information Clinical data and information Administrative and regulatory information How does a vaccine go from \"Authorized for emergency use\" to \"Licensed\" (i.e., approved) and how long will that take? The FDA has indicated that following submission of an EUA request and the issuance of an EUA, they expect vaccine manufacturers to continue to collect placebo-controlled data in any ongoing trials for as long as feasible to obtain additional safety and effectiveness information and work towards submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) as soon as possible. Both Pfizer and Moderna have announced they plan to submit a BLA. Are mRNA vaccines safe? mRNA vaccines are being held to the same safety and effectiveness standards as all other types of vaccines in the United States. mRNA vaccines do not use the live virus that causes COVID-19 and they cannot give someone COVID-19. mRNA never enters the nucleus of the cell, which is where our genetic material (DNA) is kept. The cell breaks down and gets rid of the mRNA soon after it is finished using the instructions. The mRNA vaccines do not affect or interact with our DNA in any way. There are currently no licensed mRNA vaccines in the United States. However, researchers have been studying mRNA vaccines for flu, Zika, rabies and cytomegalovirus (CMV). As soon as the necessary information about the virus that causes COVID-19 was available, scientists began designing the mRNA instructions for cells to build the unique spike protein into an mRNA vaccine. Beyond vaccines, cancer research has used mRNA to trigger the immune system to target specific cancer cells. More information on mRNA vaccines is available from the CDC. Vaccine allocation and distribution Vaccine allocation and distribution How will vaccine be allocated to jurisdictions and other entities (i.e., federal entities or tribal nations)? Initial vaccine allocation to jurisdictions will happen on a pro-rata basis according to the jurisdiction's population. Jurisdictions have provided the locations where initial vaccine doses will be shipped. After initial distribution, jurisdictions will order their weekly allocations. Jurisdictions will place orders on behalf of providers. Tribal Nations can opt to receive vaccine through their jurisdiction or through the Indian Health Service. How can I determine my state's plan for vaccine operations and distribution? The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials has created a compendium of state plans. The CDC has also posted the executive summaries of each jurisdiction's plan, to provide a general understanding of their strategy. Jurisdictions have provided the locations where initial vaccine doses will be shipped. When will vaccine be distributed to physician offices? In April of 2021, the Biden administration issued guidance to states on Expanding COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution to Primary Care Providers to Address Disparities in Immunization. The guidance encourages states to significantly increase allocation of vaccines to primary care providers. The guidance recommends that at least 60% of doses distributed to medical offices be allocated to those located in the most socially vulnerable communities in each jurisdiction. The AMA has been urging the administration to increase the vaccine distribution to physician offices and this is a good first step. Vaccine administration Vaccine administration What do physicians need to do to be eligible to administer COVID-19 vaccines? To receive and administer COVID-19 vaccine and ancillary supplies, vaccination providers must enroll in the federal government COVID-19 Vaccination Program, coordinated through their jurisdiction's immunization program, by signing and agreeing to conditions outlined in the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement. CDC will make this agreement available to each jurisdiction's immunization program for use in conducting outreach and enrolling vaccination providers. Physicians should reach out to their state health department to enroll. What vaccine storage and handling requirements do physicians need to be aware of? COVID-19 vaccination providers should refer to the \"EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers\" and manufacturer information for detailed storage and handling information for each vaccine. Most vaccine products will be provided in a two-dose series and some vaccine products will require special storage and handling (e.g., ultra-cold storage). COVID-19 vaccine providers are required to: Store and handle COVID-19 vaccines under proper conditions, including maintaining cold chain conditions and chain of custody at all times in accordance with an EUA or vaccine package insert, manufacturer guidance and CDC guidance. Monitor storage unit temperatures at all times, using equipment and practices that comply with guidance in the CDC vaccine storage and handling toolkit. Comply with immunization program guidance for handling temperature excursions. Monitor and comply with COVID-19 vaccine expiration dates. Preserve all records related to COVID-19 vaccine management for a minimum of three years. Comply with federal instructions and timelines for disposing of COVID-19 vaccine and diluent, including unused doses. What will be included in the vaccine ancillary supply kits? Ancillary supply kits will include needles, syringes, alcohol prep pads, COVID-19 vaccination record cards for each vaccine recipient and a minimal supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), including surgical masks and face shields, for vaccinators. Each kit that is centrally distributed by the CDC will include supplies needed to administer 100 doses of vaccine. Needles, 105 per kit (various sizes for the population served by the ordering vaccination provider) 25-gauge, 1\" (if vaccination indicated for pediatric population) 22\u201325-gauge, 1-1.5\" (adult) Syringes, 105 per kit (ranging from 1\u20133 mL) Alcohol prep pads, 210 per kit Four surgical masks and two face shields for vaccinators per kit COVID-19 vaccination record cards for vaccine recipients, 100 per kit Vaccine needle guide detailing the appropriate length\/gauge for injections based on route, age (for children), gender and weight (for adults) COVID-19 vaccine development Get reliable information on developments in the authorization, distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Learn More If a COVID-19 vaccine that requires mixing with diluent is ordered and shipped from CDC's centralized distributor, a mixing kit that includes the necessary needles, syringes and alcohol prep pads will also be automatically added to the order. Ancillary supply kits will not include sharps containers, gloves and bandages. Additional personal protective equipment may be needed depending on vaccination provider site needs. Note that early in the response, ultra-cold (-60\u00b0C to -80\u00b0C) vaccine (if authorized for use or approved) may be shipped directly from the manufacturer in 975-dose increment. For vaccines that are shipped directly from the manufacturer, a combined kit will be included. This combined kit will include administration supplies, mixing supplies and vials of diluent to prepare the vaccine for use. Is there training available for health care professionals on COVID-19 vaccine administration? CDC is developing educational and training materials for health care professionals related to COVID-19 vaccine storage, handling and administration based on ACIP recommendations, the ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization, product information from vaccine manufacturers and results of scientific studies. Data reporting Data reporting What are the reporting requirements that physicians will need to comply with? COVID-19 vaccination providers must document vaccine administration in their medical record systems within 24 hours of administration, and use their best efforts to report administration data to the relevant system for the jurisdiction, i.e., Immunization Information System (IIS) as soon as practicable and no later than 72 hours after administration. All COVID-19 vaccination providers must report COVID-19 vaccine inventory daily into Vaccines.gov. In some jurisdictions, providers may report vaccine inventory to the jurisdiction's IIS for the jurisdiction to upload into Vaccines.gov. If you have questions about the process for your jurisdiction, please contact your jurisdiction's immunization program. For more information, see the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Provider Support page for Data and Reporting. Vaccine safety Vaccine safety What additional steps are being taken to ensure vaccine safety post-authorization? After a vaccine is authorized or approved for use, numerous vaccine safety monitoring systems watch for adverse events. If an unexpected adverse event is identified, experts quickly study it further to assess whether it is a true safety concern. FDA, CDC and other federal partners will use established and new systems to monitor COVID-19 vaccines safety. VAERS is a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems with vaccines. VAERS can identify \"signals\" that might indicate possible safety problems requiring additional investigation. COVID-19 vaccination providers are required to report the following to VAERS: Vaccine administration errors (whether associated with an adverse event or not) Serious adverse events (even if they are not sure if the vaccination caused the event) Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children or adults Cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death Physicians should encourage patients to participate in V-SAFE. V-SAFE is a new smartphone-based, after-vaccination health checker for people who receive COVID-19 vaccines. V-SAFE will use text messaging and web surveys to check in with vaccine recipients and will also provide telephone follow up to anyone who reports medically important adverse events. If a link is found between a side effect and a COVID-19 vaccine, public health officials will take appropriate action by weighing the benefits of the vaccine against its risks to determine if recommendations for using the vaccine should change and continuously monitor and evaluate safety thereafter. Clinical considerations Clinical considerations What are the current clinical considerations for use of the J&J\/Janssen vaccine given the risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)? There is a plausible causal relationship between J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and a rare and serious adverse event\u2014blood clots with low platelets (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS). However, after reviewing all available safety data, the CDC and FDA recommended resuming use of this vaccine in the United States given that the benefits outweigh the risks. See the updated recommendations from the ACIP. What are the symptoms of TTS? TTS is rare, occurring at a rate of about 7 per 1 million vaccinated women between 18 and 49 years old. For women 50 years and older and men of all ages, this adverse event is even more rare. For three weeks after receiving the vaccine, physicians and patients should be on the lookout for possible symptoms of a blood clot with low platelets. These include severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision, shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, persistent abdominal pain or petechiae. What is the appropriate clinical course of action if TTS is suspected in a patient following the J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine? If TTS is suspected physicians should obtain platelet counts and screen for evidence of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. In patients with a thrombotic event and thrombocytopenia after the J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, evaluate initially with a screening PF4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay as would be performed for autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Consultation with a hematologist is strongly recommended. Patients with TTS following receipt of J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine should not be treated with heparin, unless HIT testing is negative. If HIT testing is positive or unable to be performed, non- heparin anticoagulants and high-dose intravenous immune globulin should be strongly considered. Report averse events to VAERS. For more information see the CDC Health Alert and guidance from the American Society of Hematology. What allergic reactions are a contraindication to vaccination for COVID-19? Contraindications to COVID-19 vaccines include severe allergic reaction after a previous dose or to a component of the COVID-19 vaccine or immediate allergic reaction of any severity to a previous dose or a known allergy to a component of the vaccine. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is an ingredient in mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and polysorbate 80 is an ingredient in J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. PEG and polysorbate are structurally related and cross-reactive hypersensitivity between these compounds may occur. People with a contraindication to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have a precaution to J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and vice versa. Among people who received one mRNA COVID-19 dose but for whom the second dose is contraindicated, consideration may be given to vaccination with J&J\/ Janssen COVID-19 vaccine at least 28 days after the mRNA COVID-19 dose. For people with these contraindications or precautions, referral to an allergist-immunologist should be considered. For more information see the CDC's Interim Clinical Considerations for COVID-19 vaccines. What is the ACIP's position on the vaccination of pregnant or lactating people? Pregnant persons are eligible for and can receive a COVID-19 vaccine. A conversation between the patient and their clinical team, while not required, may assist with decisions about the use of a COVID-19 vaccine. Data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people are limited. Based on current knowledge, experts believe that COVID-19 vaccines are unlikely to pose a risk to the pregnant person or fetus. When making a decision, pregnant people and their physician should consider the level of COVID-19 community transmission, the patient's personal risk of contracting COVID-19, the increased risks of severe COVID-19 to the patient and potential risks to the fetus, the known and potential benefits of vaccination, efficacy of the vaccine, side effects of the vaccine and the limited but growing data about the safety of the vaccine during pregnancy. Clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people are underway or planned. Vaccine manufacturers are also following outcomes in people in the clinical trials who became pregnant. Early data from vaccine safety surveillance systems have not identified safety concerns for pregnant people who were vaccinated or for their babies. Most of the pregnancies in these systems are ongoing; additional follow-up is needed, particularly among those vaccinated in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. For more information, see the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Practice Advisory for vaccinating pregnant and lactating patients against COVID-19. What is known about the risk of myocarditis in kids following mRNA vaccines? The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Work Group concluded that there are relatively few reports of myocarditis to date and the cases are occurring predominately in adolescents and young adults; more often in males than females, more often following an individual's second dose and typically within four days after vaccination. Most cases appear to be mild. Within CDC safety monitoring systems, rates of myocarditis reports in the window following COVID-19 vaccination have not differed from expected baseline rates. However, information is being collected and reviewed on potential myocarditis cases that were reported into VAERS. For more information, see the CDC's Clinical Considerations for Myocarditis and Pericarditis after Receipt of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Among Adolescents and Young Adults. What is the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in immunocompromised patients? Immunocompromised people can receive COVID-19 vaccination. People with immunocompromising conditions or who take immunosuppressive medications might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19. While no data are available to establish COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy in these groups, currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines are not live vaccines and therefore can be safely administered to immunocompromised people. Based on general best practices for vaccination of immunocompromised people, ideally COVID-19 vaccination should be completed at least two weeks before initiation of immunosuppressive therapies. When it is not possible to administer a complete COVID-19 vaccination series (i.e., two doses of an mRNA vaccine or a single dose of J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine) in advance, people on immunosuppressive therapy can still receive COVID-19 vaccination. People should be counseled about the potential for reduced immune responses and the need to continue to follow current guidance to protect themselves against COVID-19. Can COVID-19 vaccines be co-administered with other vaccines? Data are not currently available for COVID-19 vaccines administered simultaneously with other vaccines. However, extensive experience with non-COVID-19 vaccines has demonstrated that immunogenicity and adverse event profiles are generally similar when vaccines are administered simultaneously as when they are administered alone. As a result, the CDC has indicated that COVID-19 vaccines may be administered along with other vaccines without regard to timing. If multiple vaccines are administered in a single visit, each vaccine should be administered in a different injection site. The deltoid muscle can be used for more than one intramuscular injection. Building vaccine confidence Building vaccine confidence How can I best prepare to address patient questions about COVID-19 vaccines? COVI-19 vaccines are new and questions from patients should be expected. Physicians are one of the most trusted sources of information for their patients on vaccines. Providing a strong recommendation is critical for vaccine acceptance. Physicians can share the importance of vaccines in protecting individual patient health as well as the health of loved ones or even discuss your personal plans as a health care professional to get vaccinated.

Jurisdictions have provided the locations where initial vaccine doses will be shipped. After initial distribution, jurisdictions will order their weekly allocations. Jurisdictions will place orders on behalf of providers. Tribal Nations can opt to receive vaccine through their jurisdiction or through the Indian Health Service. How can I determine my state's plan for vaccine operations and distribution? The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials has created a compendium of state plans. The CDC has also posted the executive summaries of each jurisdiction's plan, to provide a general understanding of their strategy. Jurisdictions have provided the locations where initial vaccine doses will be shipped. When will vaccine be distributed to physician offices? In April of 2021, the Biden administration issued guidance to states on Expanding COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution to Primary Care Providers to Address Disparities in Immunization. The guidance encourages states to significantly increase allocation of vaccines to primary care providers. The guidance recommends that at least 60% of doses distributed to medical offices be allocated to those located in the most socially vulnerable communities in each jurisdiction. The AMA has been urging the administration to increase the vaccine distribution to physician offices and this is a good first step. Vaccine administration Vaccine administration What do physicians need to do to be eligible to administer COVID-19 vaccines? To receive and administer COVID-19 vaccine and ancillary supplies, vaccination providers must enroll in the federal government COVID-19 Vaccination Program, coordinated through their jurisdiction's immunization program, by signing and agreeing to conditions outlined in the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement. CDC will make this agreement available to each jurisdiction's immunization program for use in conducting outreach and enrolling vaccination providers. Physicians should reach out to their state health department to enroll. What vaccine storage and handling requirements do physicians need to be aware of? COVID-19 vaccination providers should refer to the \"EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers\" and manufacturer information for detailed storage and handling information for each vaccine. Most vaccine products will be provided in a two-dose series and some vaccine products will require special storage and handling (e.g., ultra-cold storage). COVID-19 vaccine providers are required to: Store and handle COVID-19 vaccines under proper conditions, including maintaining cold chain conditions and chain of custody at all times in accordance with an EUA or vaccine package insert, manufacturer guidance and CDC guidance. Monitor storage unit temperatures at all times, using equipment and practices that comply with guidance in the CDC vaccine storage and handling toolkit. Comply with immunization program guidance for handling temperature excursions. Monitor and comply with COVID-19 vaccine expiration dates. Preserve all records related to COVID-19 vaccine management for a minimum of three years. Comply with federal instructions and timelines for disposing of COVID-19 vaccine and diluent, including unused doses. What will be included in the vaccine ancillary supply kits? Ancillary supply kits will include needles, syringes, alcohol prep pads, COVID-19 vaccination record cards for each vaccine recipient and a minimal supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), including surgical masks and face shields, for vaccinators. Each kit that is centrally distributed by the CDC will include supplies needed to administer 100 doses of vaccine. Needles, 105 per kit (various sizes for the population served by the ordering vaccination provider) 25-gauge, 1\" (if vaccination indicated for pediatric population) 22\u201325-gauge, 1-1.5\" (adult) Syringes, 105 per kit (ranging from 1\u20133 mL) Alcohol prep pads, 210 per kit Four surgical masks and two face shields for vaccinators per kit COVID-19 vaccination record cards for vaccine recipients, 100 per kit Vaccine needle guide detailing the appropriate length\/gauge for injections based on route, age (for children), gender and weight (for adults) COVID-19 vaccine development Get reliable information on developments in the authorization, distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Learn More If a COVID-19 vaccine that requires mixing with diluent is ordered and shipped from CDC's centralized distributor, a mixing kit that includes the necessary needles, syringes and alcohol prep pads will also be automatically added to the order. Ancillary supply kits will not include sharps containers, gloves and bandages. Additional personal protective equipment may be needed depending on vaccination provider site needs. Note that early in the response, ultra-cold (-60\u00b0C to -80\u00b0C) vaccine (if authorized for use or approved) may be shipped directly from the manufacturer in 975-dose increment. For vaccines that are shipped directly from the manufacturer, a combined kit will be included. This combined kit will include administration supplies, mixing supplies and vials of diluent to prepare the vaccine for use. Is there training available for health care professionals on COVID-19 vaccine administration? CDC is developing educational and training materials for health care professionals related to COVID-19 vaccine storage, handling and administration based on ACIP recommendations, the ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization, product information from vaccine manufacturers and results of scientific studies. Data reporting Data reporting What are the reporting requirements that physicians will need to comply with? COVID-19 vaccination providers must document vaccine administration in their medical record systems within 24 hours of administration, and use their best efforts to report administration data to the relevant system for the jurisdiction, i.e., Immunization Information System (IIS) as soon as practicable and no later than 72 hours after administration. All COVID-19 vaccination providers must report COVID-19 vaccine inventory daily into Vaccines.gov. In some jurisdictions, providers may report vaccine inventory to the jurisdiction's IIS for the jurisdiction to upload into Vaccines.gov. If you have questions about the process for your jurisdiction, please contact your jurisdiction's immunization program. For more information, see the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Provider Support page for Data and Reporting. Vaccine safety Vaccine safety What additional steps are being taken to ensure vaccine safety post-authorization? After a vaccine is authorized or approved for use, numerous vaccine safety monitoring systems watch for adverse events. If an unexpected adverse event is identified, experts quickly study it further to assess whether it is a true safety concern. FDA, CDC and other federal partners will use established and new systems to monitor COVID-19 vaccines safety. VAERS is a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems with vaccines. VAERS can identify \"signals\" that might indicate possible safety problems requiring additional investigation. COVID-19 vaccination providers are required to report the following to VAERS: Vaccine administration errors (whether associated with an adverse event or not) Serious adverse events (even if they are not sure if the vaccination caused the event) Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children or adults Cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death Physicians should encourage patients to participate in V-SAFE. V-SAFE is a new smartphone-based, after-vaccination health checker for people who receive COVID-19 vaccines. V-SAFE will use text messaging and web surveys to check in with vaccine recipients and will also provide telephone follow up to anyone who reports medically important adverse events. If a link is found between a side effect and a COVID-19 vaccine, public health officials will take appropriate action by weighing the benefits of the vaccine against its risks to determine if recommendations for using the vaccine should change and continuously monitor and evaluate safety thereafter. Clinical considerations Clinical considerations What are the current clinical considerations for use of the J&J\/Janssen vaccine given the risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)? There is a plausible causal relationship between J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and a rare and serious adverse event\u2014blood clots with low platelets (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS). However, after reviewing all available safety data, the CDC and FDA recommended resuming use of this vaccine in the United States given that the benefits outweigh the risks. See the updated recommendations from the ACIP. What are the symptoms of TTS? TTS is rare, occurring at a rate of about 7 per 1 million vaccinated women between 18 and 49 years old. For women 50 years and older and men of all ages, this adverse event is even more rare. For three weeks after receiving the vaccine, physicians and patients should be on the lookout for possible symptoms of a blood clot with low platelets. These include severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision, shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, persistent abdominal pain or petechiae. What is the appropriate clinical course of action if TTS is suspected in a patient following the J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine? If TTS is suspected physicians should obtain platelet counts and screen for evidence of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. In patients with a thrombotic event and thrombocytopenia after the J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, evaluate initially with a screening PF4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay as would be performed for autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Consultation with a hematologist is strongly recommended. Patients with TTS following receipt of J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine should not be treated with heparin, unless HIT testing is negative. If HIT testing is positive or unable to be performed, non- heparin anticoagulants and high-dose intravenous immune globulin should be strongly considered. Report averse events to VAERS. For more information see the CDC Health Alert and guidance from the American Society of Hematology. What allergic reactions are a contraindication to vaccination for COVID-19? Contraindications to COVID-19 vaccines include severe allergic reaction after a previous dose or to a component of the COVID-19 vaccine or immediate allergic reaction of any severity to a previous dose or a known allergy to a component of the vaccine. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is an ingredient in mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and polysorbate 80 is an ingredient in J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. PEG and polysorbate are structurally related and cross-reactive hypersensitivity between these compounds may occur. People with a contraindication to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have a precaution to J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and vice versa. Among people who received one mRNA COVID-19 dose but for whom the second dose is contraindicated, consideration may be given to vaccination with J&J\/ Janssen COVID-19 vaccine at least 28 days after the mRNA COVID-19 dose. For people with these contraindications or precautions, referral to an allergist-immunologist should be considered. For more information see the CDC's Interim Clinical Considerations for COVID-19 vaccines. What is the ACIP's position on the vaccination of pregnant or lactating people? Pregnant persons are eligible for and can receive a COVID-19 vaccine. A conversation between the patient and their clinical team, while not required, may assist with decisions about the use of a COVID-19 vaccine. Data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people are limited. Based on current knowledge, experts believe that COVID-19 vaccines are unlikely to pose a risk to the pregnant person or fetus. When making a decision, pregnant people and their physician should consider the level of COVID-19 community transmission, the patient's personal risk of contracting COVID-19, the increased risks of severe COVID-19 to the patient and potential risks to the fetus, the known and potential benefits of vaccination, efficacy of the vaccine, side effects of the vaccine and the limited but growing data about the safety of the vaccine during pregnancy. Clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people are underway or planned. Vaccine manufacturers are also following outcomes in people in the clinical trials who became pregnant. Early data from vaccine safety surveillance systems have not identified safety concerns for pregnant people who were vaccinated or for their babies. Most of the pregnancies in these systems are ongoing; additional follow-up is needed, particularly among those vaccinated in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. For more information, see the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Practice Advisory for vaccinating pregnant and lactating patients against COVID-19. What is known about the risk of myocarditis in kids following mRNA vaccines? The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Work Group concluded that there are relatively few reports of myocarditis to date and the cases are occurring predominately in adolescents and young adults; more often in males than females, more often following an individual's second dose and typically within four days after vaccination. Most cases appear to be mild. Within CDC safety monitoring systems, rates of myocarditis reports in the window following COVID-19 vaccination have not differed from expected baseline rates. However, information is being collected and reviewed on potential myocarditis cases that were reported into VAERS. For more information, see the CDC's Clinical Considerations for Myocarditis and Pericarditis after Receipt of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Among Adolescents and Young Adults. What is the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in immunocompromised patients? Immunocompromised people can receive COVID-19 vaccination. People with immunocompromising conditions or who take immunosuppressive medications might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19. While no data are available to establish COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy in these groups, currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines are not live vaccines and therefore can be safely administered to immunocompromised people. Based on general best practices for vaccination of immunocompromised people, ideally COVID-19 vaccination should be completed at least two weeks before initiation of immunosuppressive therapies. When it is not possible to administer a complete COVID-19 vaccination series (i.e., two doses of an mRNA vaccine or a single dose of J&J\/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine) in advance, people on immunosuppressive therapy can still receive COVID-19 vaccination. People should be counseled about the potential for reduced immune responses and the need to continue to follow current guidance to protect themselves against COVID-19. Can COVID-19 vaccines be co-administered with other vaccines? Data are not currently available for COVID-19 vaccines administered simultaneously with other vaccines. However, extensive experience with non-COVID-19 vaccines has demonstrated that immunogenicity and adverse event profiles are generally similar when vaccines are administered simultaneously as when they are administered alone. As a result, the CDC has indicated that COVID-19 vaccines may be administered along with other vaccines without regard to timing. If multiple vaccines are administered in a single visit, each vaccine should be administered in a different injection site. The deltoid muscle can be used for more than one intramuscular injection. Building vaccine confidence Building vaccine confidence How can I best prepare to address patient questions about COVID-19 vaccines? COVI-19 vaccines are new and questions from patients should be expected. Physicians are one of the most trusted sources of information for their patients on vaccines. Providing a strong recommendation is critical for vaccine acceptance. Physicians can share the importance of vaccines in protecting individual patient health as well as the health of loved ones or even discuss your personal plans as a health care professional to get vaccinated.

        "text":"Key Points Question Is participation in a remote monitoring program for COVID-19, supported by nurses around the clock, associated with subsequent hospitalization? Findings In this cohort study of 9378 patients, participation in a remote monitoring program was associated with lower odds of hospitalization 2 to 14 days after a positive COVID-19 test, after an adjusted analysis using inverse propensity score weighting. Meaning These findings suggest that remote patient monitoring for COVID-19 may help patients better manage symptoms at home and help hospitals better manage bed capacity. Abstract Importance Health care systems have implemented remote patient monitoring (RPM) programs to manage patients with COVID-19 at home, but the associations between participation and outcomes or resource utilization are unclear. Objective To assess whether an RPM program for COVID-19 is associated with lower or higher likelihood of hospitalization and whether patients who are admitted present earlier or later for hospital care. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective, observational, cohort study of RPM was performed at Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin Health Network, an academic health system in southeastern Wisconsin. Participants included patients with internal primary care physicians and a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in the ambulatory setting between March 30, 2020, and December 15, 2020. Data analysis was performed from February 15, 2021, to February 2, 2022. Exposures Activation of RPM program. Main Outcomes and Measures Hospitalizations within 2 to 14 days of a positive test. Inverse propensity score weighting was used to account for differences between groups. Sensitivity analyses were performed looking at usage of the RPM among patients who activated the program. Results A total of 10 660 COVID-19\u2013positive ambulatory patients were eligible, and 9378 (88.0%) had email or mobile numbers on file and were invited into the RPM program; the mean (SD) age was 46.9 (16.3) years and 5448 patients (58.1%) were women. Patients who activated monitoring (5364 patients [57.2%]) had a mean (SD) of 35.3 (33.0) check-ins and a mean (SD) of 1.27 (2.79) (median [IQR], 0 [0-1]) free-text comments. A total of 878 patients (16.4%) experienced at least 1 alert; 128 of 5364 activated patients (2.4%) and 158 of 4014 inactivated patients (3.9%) were hospitalized (\u03c72 1 = 18.65; P < .001). In weighted regression analysis, activation of RPM was associated with a lower odds of hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54-0.86; P = .001) adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, and time period. Monitored patients had a longer mean (SD) time between test and hospitalization (6.67 [3.21] days vs 5.24 [3.03] days), a shorter length of stay (4.44 [4.43] days vs 7.14 [8.63] days), and less intensive care use (15 patients [0.3%] vs 44 patients [1.1%]). Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that activation of an RPM program is associated with lower hospitalization, intensive care use, and length of stay among patients with COVID-19. Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has required substantial and expeditious changes to health care systems to address challenges posed toward allocating hospital resources, preventing community transmission, and treating patients.1-4 Particularly during the pandemic onset and the waves of more contagious variants, substantial strain has been placed on hospital systems to address shortages of staff, beds, and supplies,5 forcing them to implement rationing programs and measures to match patients with the most appropriate level of care.6 To mitigate community transmission and optimize resource utilization, health care systems have rapidly expanded telemedicine programs across all specialties.7,8 In addition, strategies to care for people at home using remote patient monitoring (RPM) were created to triage and manage patients with COVID-19, who may worsen during the duration of their illness.9 For example, patients who present with mild symptoms at initial diagnosis can deteriorate greatly during the course of their illness, requiring hospital admission and critical care.10 Although RPM has generally been trialed in the management of chronic disease, it may also be an effective tool to manage health care resources for more acute episodes of care.8,11-14 Previous studies8,15,16 evaluated home monitoring in patients with COVID-19 with mild symptoms during self-isolation, with early studies17 showing positive results with fewer admissions. Pulse oximetry at home has been successful in identifying patients needing emergent medical attention.14,18-20 It is unclear, however, whether participating in an RPM program is associated with patient outcomes or appropriate in-person resource utilization. Our objective in this study is to evaluate the implementation of a large-scale daily RPM program for patients with COVID-19 who were managing symptoms from home. We particularly sought to assess the association of RPM with health care utilization (ie, whether RPM would be associated with increased or decreased admissions compared with those not undergoing monitoring). Secondarily, we sought to see whether patients who were eventually admitted would present earlier or later for hospital care. In these analyses, we sought to also know whether RPM was associated with inappropriate admissions (length of stay \u22641 day) or inappropriate home care (a delayed presentation leading to higher mortality, intensive care utilization, or length of stay). Methods Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study was conducted within an academic-community health system in southeastern Wisconsin. Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin Health Network provides 1.5 million ambulatory visits and cares for 55 000 hospitalized patients annually. The Health Network operates 45 clinic locations in the Milwaukee metropolitan area. All patients who underwent COVID-19 testing at an affiliated laboratory site who tested positive were eligible for the program. Any patient could request testing either through our mobile application, patient portal, telephone, or in-person urgent care or scheduled ambulatory visits. Patients were automatically invited to enroll in the RPM program if their email address or mobile telephone number was on file at the time of testing. Patients were also invited if they had an affiliated primary care physician (PCP) within the system and had an outside positive test that was abstracted into the electronic health record (EHR). Patients signed a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act waiver and agreed to the program\u2019s terms of use at enrollment. In addition to the email invitation, patients received a COVID Care Kit, a collection of educational materials, handouts, and a pulse oximeter that was available to pick up from testing sites; after October 2020, kits were automatically shipped to patients. The program group was defined as any patient who activated the RPM program. Activation was defined as claiming an account within the RPM platform. As a sensitivity analysis, we secondarily assessed participation if the patient, in addition to activating their account, had at least 1 or more check-ins, which are programmed questions to which patients respond. This study was reviewed and approved by the Medical College of Wisconsin institutional review board. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines for reporting observational studies were followed.21 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria All patients were included if they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the period of March 31, 2020, through December 15, 2020, at an affiliated laboratory site. Follow-up data collection for hospitalization within 14 days continued through December 31, 2020. We excluded patients younger than 18 years, those with asymptomatic tests (because these were often scheduled before procedures or other planned admissions), abstracted results, and patients who were admitted within 24 hours of a positive test. We further limited the patient sample to those who had internal PCPs to reduce the chance of missing hospitalizations. COVID-19 RPM Program The COVID-19 RPM program was an automated engagement solution, supported by registered nurses, designed to improve the patient experience, coordinate care, and improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19. On March 30, 2020, the system began the program using GetWellLoop (GetWellNetwork) monitored by a centralized team of Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin nurses. Patients either used a responsive web application or downloaded a mobile application. Patients were asked to track their symptoms, temperatures, and pulse oximetry readings, if available. The program provided 14 days of check-ins related to progress and symptoms, in the form of questions and structured responses, while also providing a space for free-text comments (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). The program also provided educational guidance related to COVID-19, including caring for themselves at home, minimizing spread, and stress management. A centralized virtual care team (VCT) monitored patient check-ins and free-text comments around the clock. Abnormal survey responses (eg, breathing issues or worsening fever) alerted VCT members on their dashboard. Upon reviewing the alert, the VCT contacted patients to initiate an escalation of care or to conduct further medical evaluation if warranted. VCT nurses also reacted to patient comments independently from alerts to provide education or coaching, such as how to incorporate lying in the prone position (ie, proning) into their daily care. Patients were discharged from monitoring after 18 days. Data Collection Data for evaluating program outcomes were collected using reporting databases from the EHR (Epic Systems). We collected patient profile data, including sex, age, race, address, marital status, insurance, and PCP status (internal or external). Race was assessed in this study because of known racial and ethnic disparities in accessing digital health care services.22-24 We used patient addresses geocoded to the Census block level to determine the local area deprivation index, derived from the US Census and American Community Survey,25 as a measure of socioeconomic status and grouped by quartile.26-28 Data about the clinical scenario (including presence of symptoms and their onset) were derived from the individual testing orders. We obtained other clinical data, including body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and comorbidities as calculated through the Charlson Comorbidity Index29,30 from the EHR as of the testing date. Participation in the RPM program was provided through platform usage data. These data included system registration, activation, check-ins, alerts, and comments. Main Outcomes and Measures Our primary outcome was hospitalization within 14 days of a positive COVID-19 test. Hospitalizations were included if they had a flag as being related to COVID-19 through laboratory testing or hospital billing diagnosis. Hospitalizations outside the health system were not available, and readmissions were excluded from the analysis. To reduce the likelihood of missing outside hospitalizations, we limited the analysis to patients with an internal PCP because patients with external PCPs may be more likely to seek hospital care elsewhere. To know whether RPM inadvertently may have been associated with increased mortality, such as by delaying hospitalization, we secondarily tracked patient deaths of the study cohort. Thirty-day mortality and 90-day mortality were defined as a patient marked as deceased within the EHR and\/or having a death date noted within 30 or 90 days, respectively, of a positive test date. Mortality data were extracted from the EHR system in November 2021 in case death reporting in the EHR lagged. Statistical Analysis Data analysis was performed from February 15, 2021, to February 2, 2022. To examine factors associated with activation, patients were divided into those who were enrolled and activated and those who were enrolled and did not activate. Age was categorized for analysis. We calculated the frequency for variables related to patient demographics and information related to personal health and COVID-19 status, along with means and SDs for time intervals, such as length of stay and time from test to hospitalization. A t test was used to test the mean difference of the 2 groups (RPM activated or not) in terms of the characteristics measured in continuous variables, whereas a \u03c72 test was adopted for categorical variables. For time intervals (time to hospitalization and length of stay), Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used. Two-sided tests were used with a priori levels of significance of \u03b1 = .05. All statistical analyses were performed using R programming language version 4.0.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing).31 To assess the association between activation and hospitalization, we performed propensity-weighted logistic regression using the glm package.32 With all patients being invited to use the RPM program, we used inverse propensity score weighting to account for potential bias in the observed covariates through self-selection or other mechanisms following methods by Olmos et al.33 Covariates included demographic variables, including age, sex, race, ethnicity, time period, insurance, marital status, Area Deprivation Index from the Census block level, encounter type where testing was ordered, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, prior hospitalization, and digital engagement proxied as having reviewed their COVID-19 test results electronically through the patient portal or the Froedtert & Medical College of Wisconsin mobile application. We also included a variable for time period (1 of the 3 waves in 2020) to allow for varying mean differences in outcomes over time due to patient behavior, including care avoidance34 at the beginning of the pandemic, and guideline changes during the 3 COVID-19 waves that could have affected enrollment status or clinical outcomes. The average treatment effect was calculated as the mean difference in weighted outcomes between the activated group and the invited but nonactivated group. Inverse probability weights were based on the propensity score of each patient,35 defined as the probability of a patient activating RPM conditional on observed covariates as described already, for doubly robust estimation.36 With less than 4% of the data missing observations for either socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, or obesity, the primary analysis was run on complete cases. We used multiple imputation using the mice37,38 package to confirm the results. We ran additional models that included only activated RPM patients and factoring whether they engaged in the program (had check-ins digitally) or not. We also performed propensity score matching with full matching39 using the MatchIT40 package. Finally, we performed a propensity-weighted Cox proportional-hazards analysis on complete-case data using the Survival41 and Survminer42 packages. In the weighted Cox model, the starting point was the date of the test and patients were only censored at day 14. Results During the study period, 135 786 patients underwent testing for COVID-19, and 25 040 patients (18.4%) had at least 1 positive test. Of these patients, 10 660 were retained for analysis after excluding those who were younger than 18 years, who did not have an internal PCP, or who were hospitalized at the time of testing (Figure 1). A total of 9378 patients (88.0%) were offered enrollment into the RPM program through an email invitation, comprising the final analytical cohort. The mean (SD) age of invited patients was 46.9 (16.3) years, and 5448 patients (58.1%) were women. Engagement With the RPM Program Of the 9378 invited patients, 5364 (57.2%) activated monitoring (Table 1). Patients who activated were predominantly female (3467 of 5364 patients [64.6%] vs 1981 of 4014 patients [49.4%]). Differences in activation by race and ethnicity were not significant, although differences by comorbidities were observed. Patients with Medicare were also less likely to activate than those without Medicare (795 of 5364 patients [14.8%] vs 769 of 4014 patients [19.2%]; \u03c72 3 = 38.65; P < .001). When patients requested testing through our digital platform for testing, 1805 of 2927 patients (61.7%) activated, whereas 354 of 723 patients (49.0%) with in-person visits activated (\u03c72 5 = 61.25; P < .001). Patients who activated had a mean (SD) of 35.3 (33.0) check-ins and a mean (SD) of 1.27 (2.79) (median [IQR], 0 [0-1]) comments with their clinical care teams. A total of 878 patients (16.4%) experienced at least 1 alert. Utilization and Clinical Outcomes One hundred twenty-eight of 5364 activated patients (2.4%) and 158 of 4014 inactivated patients (3.9%) were hospitalized within 2 to 14 days of their test (\u03c72 1 = 18.65; P < .001) (Table 2). The odds of admission were higher for patients with advanced age, male gender, racial and ethnic minority groups, and those with obesity or more medical comorbidities. The mean (SD) time between test and hospitalization was slightly longer among activated patients (6.67 [3.21] days vs 5.24 [3.03] days). Among those patients admitted, the mean (SD) length of stay was 2.7 days lower for RPM-activated patients than for nonactivated patients (4.44 [4.43] days vs 7.14 [8.63] days; t = \u22123.4185; df = 244.03; P = .001). Monitored patients had less intensive care use than those who were not monitored (15 patients [0.3%] vs 44 patients [1.1%]). Patients with RPM were not significantly more likely to have short (length of stay \u22641 day) hospital stays (47 of 222 patients [21.2%] vs 50 of 210 patients [23.8%]). The unadjusted 90-day mortality for all patients was 0.2% (10 patients) among activated patients and 0.6% (26 patients) among nonactivated patients. Logistic Regression With Inverse Propensity Score Weighting In multivariable regression analysis with inverse propensity score weighting (for the likelihood of activating RPM, the C statistic was 0.67; for balance and propensity distribution, see eFigure 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement), activation of RPM was associated with a lower odds of hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54-0.86; P = .001) (Table 3). Results using multiple imputation for missing data were similar (eTable 1 in the Supplement). As a robustness check, the Cox proportional-hazard regression with inverse propensity score weighting provided similar results (Figure 2 and eTable 2 in the Supplement), as did regression with propensity score matching (eTable 3 and eFigure 4 in the Supplement). As a sensitivity analysis of only activated patients, patients with check-ins had a lower odds of hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.33-0.73; P = .001) after weighting on propensity to have at least 1 check-in (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Discussion In this retrospective cohort study of 9378 patients who were offered RPM for COVID-19, activation of the RPM program was associated with lower hospitalization, intensive care unit stay, and length of stay. Following an adjusted analysis using inverse propensity score weighting, patients who activated still had lower odds of being hospitalized, adjusted for observed clinical and sociodemographic characteristics. Although a strict control group was not available, because of the rapid implementation and goal of assisting patients and clinical operations, several methods including the inverse propensity score weighting and propensity score matching were used to balance the comparison cohorts on the basis of the observed covariates. The positive outcomes seen in reducing hospitalization are similar to those described in earlier studies.11,17,43-45 We found baseline differences between patients who did and did not active RPM, similar to prior studies, although our application of the inverse propensity score weighting provides a more robust mechanism for reducing the impact of these observed differences on our result and a more advanced analytical evaluation of the association of RPM with the main study outcomes. Our study is also different because it was delivered to a more general population as well. The mechanism underlying RPM\u2019s association with hospitalization is not clear, but several factors may explain it. First, patients who were monitored also received education that may have affected their care trajectory, such as proning to help improve oxygenation. Second, physicians caring for patients who received the pulse oximetry and nurse support through the RPM might have felt comfortable not sending patients into the emergency department and hospital. An alternate explanation is that patients who activated were less ill, and residual confounding that could not be removed accounted for these differences. In both inverse propensity score weighting and propensity score matching, with reasonable C statistics and matching parameters, the associations persisted. In addition to findings related to hospital admission, the data showed that patients who were admitted to the hospital while being monitored were hospitalized later than those without monitoring. Although the reasons behind such delays are not immediately known, there are different hypotheses that may explain this finding. One could be that the RPM program allowed patients to be managed and monitored at a level that would have required an admission for those who were not enrolled in the RPM\u2014that is, either the patient or a clinician chose to defer hospital-based care because of the availability of RPM. Another factor could be that the nurses\u2019 support through the RPM program delivered remote care that decreased risk and led to only essential admissions. This finding does not support a preintervention hypothesis that RPM would signal patients to be admitted earlier. The findings suggest that, although patients under RPM were admitted, on average, later than non-RPM patients, the late presentation was not inappropriate given that hospital length of stay, critical care utilization, and mortality were not increased in this group. Our study also found that age and race were significantly associated with the risk of hospitalization. These results mirror the current body of evidence suggesting who is most at risk both for contracting COVID-19 and experiencing severe symptoms.46-48 To that end, although RPM and other digital interventions can be effective in deploying and allocating scarce health care resources, we must continue investigating whether such strategies exacerbate existing disparities in care utilization and outcomes. These disparities have been observed in many other digital health interventions, including video visits and telemedicine.49-51 The lessons learned from our study and others are numerous, although many questions remain regarding best practice RPM implementation for COVID-19 and other diseases and conditions. First, it remains unknown at which point in the course of disease RPM is most impactful on outcomes. Although the digital component of the RPM is easily scalable, concerns regarding other components should be carefully evaluated. In our study, we implemented a remote nurse support model. The virtual nurses had full access to the EHR and could communicate with clinical care teams. Expanding similar programs across multiple areas and diseases would require sophisticated operations and resource allocations. Further research and evaluation of these new remote operating models are warranted and should be carefully evaluated for safety. Expansion of these programs should consider access and equity. In a previous study,50 we have demonstrated that access to digital technology is disproportionate among racial groups and socioeconomic statuses. Our program was accessible to anyone with a smartphone, although some technological literacy is required. Simple text messaging may also help reach additional people. Limitations Some limitations of this study should be addressed. With the observational nature of the study, selection bias of healthier patients into the RPM activation exists, and although we used propensity score adjustment, residual confounding may still persist. The data were retrospective and sourced from databases, which may make the results less reliable. For example, we could not verify whether hospitalization, escalation of care, or mortality were a result of COVID-19 or another cause. To mitigate this effect, we attempted to limit follow-up data to include 15 days given the reported duration of symptoms, and we reexamined mortality data from the EHR after at least 9 months following the study period. Location and hospital system factors may have influenced enrollment rates and clinical outcomes, which could make our results less generalizable to all populations. In addition, COVID-19 treatment guidelines (decision to place patients in the prone position or intubation recommendations), diagnosis (evolving symptom profile), and community transmission were highly dynamic during the early course of the pandemic.52,53 Clinical outcomes may have improved throughout the course of the pandemic. The RPM program was also rapidly updated throughout the pandemic, although the core content of monitoring, proning as tolerated, and infection control for ambulatory patients remained the same. These data were from the prevaccine era; after vaccines became available54 and distributed,55 the absolute benefit of RPM may have decreased for low-risk individuals. Conclusions This report builds upon experiences from other groups showing that RPM for COVID-19 was feasible and well-received, while adding data about outcomes. Moving beyond COVID-19, these data highlight where RPM can be a helpful adjunct to care. Resource optimization is a central tenet of both RPM and pandemic-era practices. If reducing avoidable admissions can be achieved through virtual interventions, then practitioners can focus on in-person care for the most ill patients while also limiting unnecessary contact at hospitals and clinics, which is key to decreasing the spread of COVID-19. These results may also be used to establish better care guidelines for those monitoring moderate symptoms from home. Future studies should include ethnically diverse and low health care access populations, which are shown to be at higher risk for poor outcomes in COVID-19.

        "text":"Since its emergence, the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a significant increase in COVID-19 cases. This rise in COVID-19 cases has strained hospitals and emergency departments across the United States, increasing the demand for treatments. While there is an ongoing need for people to get vaccinated\u2014and boosted\u2014against COVID-19, two antiviral oral treatments are available in limited supplies, but patient confusion still remains about who is eligible and how these treatments work. What you need to know about COVID-19 Explore top articles, videos, research highlights and more from the AMA\u2014your source for clear, evidence-based news and guidance during the pandemic. See the Latest Updates Last month, the two oral antivirals\u2014Paxlovid (PDF) and molnupiravir (PDF)\u2014were authorized for outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 under emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Treatment with these oral antivirals must begin within five days of symptom onset to maintain product efficacy. Learn what COVID-19 treatments are FDA authorized, and what works. The AMA\u2019s What Doctors Wish Patients Knew\u2122 series provides physicians with a platform to share what they want patients to understand about today\u2019s health care headlines, especially throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. In this installment, AMA member Elisa Choi, MD, an internist and infectious disease specialist, discusses what patients need to know about COVID-19 antiviral pills. There are two options There are two options \u201cThe first one is a combination of pills more commonly known Paxlovid,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of nirmatrelvir tablets and a pharmacologic boosting pill called ritonavir.\u201d \u201cThere's also a second pill called molnupiravir,\u201d she added, noting that when this antiviral enters the bloodstream, it blocks the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to replicate.\u201d \u201cFor Paxlovid, it is currently authorized for use in all adult patients and in pediatric patients who are 12 years or older who weigh at least 88 pounds,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cMolnupiravir is only authorized in adult patients who are 18 or older because molnupiravir has potential to affect bone and cartilage growth, which can be detrimental to the pediatric population.\u201d They prevent hospitalization or death They prevent hospitalization or death While data is still limited, \u201cin one study that was cited in the EUA, Paxlovid was found to reduce the proportion of people with COVID-19 related hospital admission or death by about 88% compared to the placebo treatment arm,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cAnd that is for those patients who received the treatment within five days of the onset of symptoms.\u201d \u201cThe second medication, molnupiravir, has a lower efficacy rate compared to Paxlovid,\u201d she said. \u201cThe rate of reduced hospitalization or death was about 30% compared to the placebo group.\u201d The pills are not for pre-exposure The pills are not for pre-exposure \u201cBoth of these oral antivirals are used only for treatment of patients who have confirmed COVID-19 infection,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cThese are not for any prophylaxis\u2014either as a pre-exposure or post-exposure\u2014and are only for treatment of symptoms.\u201d \u201cEven with COVID-19 infection, the EUA for these two medications really only covers those who are non-hospitalized, symptomatic adults who have mild to moderate COVID-19 illness\u201d and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, she said. Related Coverage What physicians need to know about COVID-19 clinical therapeutics Severe COVID-19 needs different care Severe COVID-19 needs different care \u201cThe studies were looking at patients who were considered mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms,\u201d said Dr. Choi, adding that \u201cif a patient has severe COVID symptoms, they probably will need a higher level of care.\u201d \u201cPaxlovid and molnupiravir are not indicated for somebody who has severe COVID-19 as these medications are intended for outpatient care,\u201d she said. For those with severe COVID-19 infection, \u201cthey likely will need oxygen support or more intense clinical monitoring.\u201d \u201cBy necessity, those patients with severe COVID-19 infection will need a high level of care that will likely require hospital admission and would not be managed as outpatients,\u201d Dr. Choi added. Paxlovid is three tablets Paxlovid is three tablets As a combination of pills, Paxlovid \u201ccomes as both nirmatrelvir and ritonavir tablets,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cFor a full dose of Paxlovid, it would be two tables of nirmatrelvir, which would equal a total of 300 milligrams taken together with one tablet of ritonavir.\u201d \u201cIt would be three tablets total and they would be taken by mouth two times a day for a total duration of five days,\u201d she said, noting that \u201chopefully when people review the prescriptions, the directions are clear about that because many people may not be used to taking a medication in combination with a pharmacologic booster pill, which is what Paxlovid is.\u201d \u201cThe ritonavir is acting as a pharmacologic boosting medication for the nirmatrelvir,\u201d Dr. Choi added. Molnupiravir is four capsules Molnupiravir is four capsules \u201cThe second antiviral, molnupiravir, is a dose of 800 milligrams total,\u201d said Dr. Choi. That means a patient is taking \u201cfour capsules of 200 milligrams each.\u201d \u201cFor molnupiravir, the four capsules are taken by mouth every 12 hours or twice a day for five days and not longer,\u201d she said. Some side effects are expected Some side effects are expected \u201cWhat appears to be the most common side effects with Paxlovid are altered taste or potentially loss of taste,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cThere also is the gastrointestinal side effect of diarrhea, and there can be myalgia, which means muscle aches.\u201d \u201cFor molnupiravir, similarly it does have some gastrointestinal side effects, namely diarrhea and nausea as well as some reported adverse side effects of dizziness.\u201d Share what medications you\u2019re taking Share what medications you\u2019re taking \u201cPaxlovid, because it has that boosting medication ritonavir as one of its components, creates potential drug interactions,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cFor anybody who receives a prescription for Paxlovid, they should make sure that their physician reviews all of the patient\u2019s other medications that they are taking.\u201d \u201cThat includes over-the-counter medications and supplements or other non-prescription medications that they take, to check for any drug interactions,\u201d she added, noting \u201cit\u2019s easiest to do that through certain drug interaction tools for which physicians will have access.\u201d \u201cMany patients don\u2019t think to mention medications that they\u2019re taking that are non-prescription or that may be supplements, but everything should be mentioned to their physicians,\u201d said Dr. Choi. Supplies are limited Supplies are limited \u201cThe demand is just outstripping the supply for these oral antivirals right now due to the quickly spreading Omicron variant of COVID-19,\u201d said Dr. Choi, noting that \u201cmost of the access for these medications are being directed by the state health departments to specific local health departments, pharmacies, clinics, hospitals and physician offices.\u201d \u201cNot all physicians will be able to get these medications on demand for their patients\u2014there\u2019s a lot of state-to-state variability,\u201d she said. Consult your doctor if pregnant Consult your doctor if pregnant \u201cMolnupiravir is not recommended for use during pregnancy because of a potential for fetal harm in pregnant persons,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cThe nuance there, though, is if the patient\u2019s physician has determined that the benefit of being treated with the molnupiravir would outweigh the risk for the patient, then there ought to be a discussion of the potential benefits versus the potential risks, of taking this medication in the pregnant patient with COVID-19 infection.\u201d \u201cWhile molnupiravir is generally not recommended during pregnancy, this is an evolving area and treatments for COVID-19 infection are limited,\u201d she added. \u201cThere needs to be good communication about the risks and benefits of molnupiravir, with clear documentation by the physician that those risks and benefits were discussed with the patient.\u201d \u201cFor Paxlovid, at this juncture, there isn\u2019t that same prohibition against use in pregnancy,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cPatients who are pregnant should, regardless, discuss the risks and benefits of any treatments for COVID-19 infection with their physicians so that the currently available evidence can be discussed.\u201d Not everyone should take these pills Not everyone should take these pills \u201cFor patients who are younger than 18, molnupiravir is not authorized at this point and should not be considered as a therapeutic option for pediatric patients with mild to moderate COVID-19,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cPediatric patients under the age of 12 or who weigh less than 88 pounds should not be prescribed Paxlovid.\u201d \u201cOther groups of patients who will need to be careful about using these antivirals are those who have severe liver impairment or liver disease,\u201d she said. \u201cThe other caution is for people who have severe kidney disease, at least until more medical data and evidence are acquired.\u201d Get vaccinated and boosted Get vaccinated and boosted \u201cI can't stress enough that these oral antivirals are not a substitute for getting a COVID-19 vaccine. We have so much more vaccine available than antivirals, currently, and prevention is always preferable to treatment,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cIf people haven't been fully COVID-19 vaccinated, they need to get up to date with their COVID-19 vaccines,\u201d which means two doses of a mRNA vaccine and a booster shot.. \u201cIf they have received the primary series of COVID-19 vaccine but have not received their COVID-19 booster vaccine, they need to get their booster dose\u201d when eligible,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are the first steps to take, even before thinking about anything related to the antivirals because the vaccines work and are very safe.\u201d \u201cThe COVID-19 vaccines and boosters work against the Omicron variant, and they will help prevent a person who gets infected with COVID-19 from suffering severe enough illness that they will need hospitalization, or\u2014worst case\u2014die,\u201d said Dr. Choi. \u201cIn no way are these antivirals a substitute for the biggest priority right now, which is getting as many people vaccinated and boosted as completely as possible against COVID-19.\u201d Visit the AMA COVID-19 resource center for clinical information, guides and resources, and updates on advocacy and medical ethics.",

        "text":"AMA News Wire Omicron and BA.5: Questions patients may have and how to answer Fueled by a highly transmissible subvariant of the COVID-19 Omicron variant, known as BA.5, SARS-CoV-2 infections are on the rise again. Even situations that have seemed to carry a relatively low risk, such as outdoor gatherings, may now pose a greater threat. Advancing public health The AMA leads the charge on public health. Our members are the frontline of patient care, expanding access to care for underserved patients and developing key prevention strategies. Join the AMA But with pandemic fatigue a pervasive reality, many have tried to move on with their lives in search of a new normal without fretting over the latest COVID-19 variants and subvariants. Yet many others, especially people with suppressed immune systems or with underlying conditions that put them at high risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes, have been left searching for answers and further guidance on what to do. Here are some questions patients might have about BA.5 and other Omicron subvariants, along with the answers that physicians should be ready to share. Is the BA.5 Omicron subvariant more contagious? Is the BA.5 Omicron subvariant more contagious? BA.5 is one of the latest subvariants of the original Omicron lineage. There is a unique cluster of mutations on the spike protein, which has led the BA.5 subvariant to potentially be the most contagious strain of SARS-CoV-2 so far. But it does not appear to lead to more severe outcomes than other COVID-19 variants and subvariants. Does the BA.5 Omicron subvariant evade immunity? Does the BA.5 Omicron subvariant evade immunity? The short answer is, yes, the mutations of the BA.5 subvariant have allowed it to sneak past the body\u2019s immune system more easily. This means if you had a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or have been vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19, you are not completely protected. Compared with the BA.2 subvariant, BA.5 has been able to spread more easily because of its ability to evade immune protection against infection induced by prior infection or vaccination. This is especially if protection has waned over time, contributing to more frequent breakthrough infections and reinfections. While breakthrough infections are not resulting in severe illness, each reinfection does carry the risk of developing long COVID, also known as post-COVID conditions. Discover questions patients have about COVID long-haulers. Is there risk of outdoor transmission with BA.5? Is there risk of outdoor transmission with BA.5? Being outside is safer than being indoors, but there are still some risks to keep in mind as the BA.5 Omicron subvariant continues to circulate. Health professionals have noted that outdoor transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has occurred, but it\u2019s more likely that you will acquire the virus indoors in poorly ventilated areas. While outdoor activities are inherently safer than indoor gatherings, the heightened transmissibility of BA.5 will likely lead to spread in both settings. One thing to note about outdoor transmission is that viral particles can disperse more quickly due to wind speed and air currents. With that, some outdoor settings, such as a tightly packed outdoor concert, can also raise a person\u2019s chances of acquiring SARS-CoV-2. What are the symptoms people are experiencing? What are the symptoms people are experiencing? BA.5 symptoms are similar to previous COVID-19 variants and subvariants. The most common symptoms include fever, runny nose, coughing, sore throat, headache, muscle pain and fatigue. Additionally, the presence and severity of a patient\u2019s symptoms can be affected by their COVID-19 vaccination status, other health conditions, age and history of prior infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). How can I protect myself from BA.5 and other Omicron subvariants? How can I protect myself from BA.5 and other Omicron subvariants? The recipe for protection is one everyone should be familiar with at this stage of the pandemic. Patients should ensure they are up to date with their COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters. Doing so helps to protect individuals from severe disease and death. It is also important to continue to wear a medical grade face mask or respirator\u2014such as a N95 or KN95\u2014when indoors and physical distancing is not possible. It is also a good idea to wear masks in crowded outdoor settings too. On top of getting vaccinated and boosted, wearing a mask or respirator, avoiding crowds and handwashing is also important. Will COVID-19 vaccine booster doses help? Will COVID-19 vaccine booster doses help? COVID-19 vaccines remain the best public health measure to help protect people from COVID-19. Vaccination can also help to reduce the likelihood of new variants emerging. This includes primary series, booster doses and additional doses for those who need them. Data is still being collected on the vaccine effectiveness against Omicron subvariants including BA.4 and BA.5. However, vaccine effectiveness against severe disease and death remains high for other Omicron subvariants and likely also for BA.4 and BA.5. Research published in the CDC\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report also shows that during both Delta- and Omicron-predominant periods, receipt of a third dose of an mRNA vaccine was highly effective at preventing COVID-19-associated emergency department and urgent care encounters as well as preventing hospitalization. Meanwhile, a JAMA study shows that receipt of three doses of a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine\u2014compared with being unvaccinated or having received two doses\u2014was associated with protection against both the Omicron and Delta variants. The AMA has developed frequently-asked-questions documents on COVID-19 vaccination covering safety, allocation and distribution, administration and more. There are two FAQs, one designed to answer patients\u2019 questions (PDF), and another to address physicians\u2019 COVID-19 vaccine questions (PDF). Related Coverage What sets apart Novavax option from other COVID-19 vaccines Will a test tell me if I have BA.5 or another subvariant? Will a test tell me if I have BA.5 or another subvariant? No, a COVID-19 test will not tell you which variant of SARS-CoV-2 caused your infection. Instead, tests will tell you whether you have a current infection. Nucleic acid amplification tests and antigen tests can both be used. But at-home tests are also available for rapid results. If an at-home test is positive, isolate and speak with your physician for further guidance. Discover what doctors wish patients knew about COVID-19 testing. What treatments are available for Omicron and its subvariants? What treatments are available for Omicron and its subvariants? Some monoclonal antibody treatments are less effective against certain SARS-CoV-2 variants and subvariants, but the monoclonal antibody treatment Bebtelovimab remains effective against Omicron. Oral antivirals, including Paxlovid, are also available to treat people with confirmed mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at risk of severe illness.

        "text":"WASHINGTON, DC \u2013 The American Medical Association (AMA), American Pharmacists Association (APhA), and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) strongly oppose the ordering, prescribing, or dispensing of ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19 outside of a clinical trial. Ivermectin is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human use to treat infections caused by internal and external parasites. It is not approved to prevent or treat COVID-19. Ivermectin is also available to treat certain veterinary conditions; medications formulated or intended for use in animals should not be used by humans. We are alarmed by reports that outpatient prescribing for and dispensing of ivermectin have increased 24-fold since before the pandemic and increased exponentially over the past few months. As such, we are calling for an immediate end to the prescribing, dispensing, and use of ivermectin for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 outside of a clinical trial. In addition, we are urging physicians, pharmacists, and other prescribers\u2014trusted health care professionals in their communities\u2014to warn patients against the use of ivermectin outside of FDA-approved indications and guidance, whether intended for use in humans or animals, as well as purchasing ivermectin from online stores. Veterinary forms of this medication are highly concentrated for large animals and pose a significant toxicity risk for humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA have issued advisories indicating that ivermectin is not authorized or approved for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. The National Institutes of Health, World Health Organization, and Merck (the manufacturer of the drug) all state there is insufficient evidence to support the use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19. The Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines on the Treatment and Management of Patients with COVID-19 also recommend against the use of ivermectin outside of a clinical trial. Use of ivermectin for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 has been demonstrated to be harmful to patients. Calls to poison control centers due to ivermectin ingestion have increased five-fold from their pre-pandemic baseline. A recent CDC Health Alert Network Advisory (PDF) recommends that health care professionals should counsel patients against use of ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19, including emphasizing the potentially toxic effects of this drug, including \u201cnausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Overdoses are associated with hypotension and neurologic effects such as decreased consciousness, confusion, hallucinations, seizures, coma, and death.\u201d For more information, we encourage patients and health care providers to consult the FDA\u2019s Consumer Update on Why You Should Not Use Ivermectin to Treat or Prevent COVID-19 and the CDC Health Alert Network Advisory on the Rapid Increase in Ivermectin Prescriptions and Reports of Severe Illness Associated with Products Containing Ivermectin to Prevent or Treat COVID-19. Patients are encouraged to talk to their physicians, pharmacists, and other prescribers about currently available therapies authorized or approved for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. The most effective ways to limit the spread of COVID-19 are to get vaccinated, wear a face mask, stay at least six feet from others in public places, wash hands frequently, and avoid large crowds of people. Our organizations strongly urge eligible unvaccinated individuals to get vaccinated. AMA COVID-19 Resource Center for Physicians APhA COVID-19 Resource Center ASHP COVID-19 Resource Center",

        "link":"https:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamainternalmedicine\/fullarticle\/2794043",
        "text":"In 2020, heart disease and cancer were the leading causes of death in the US, accounting for 1.29 million deaths, followed by COVID-19, accounting for 350 000 deaths.1-3 The pandemic may also have indirectly led to increases in other causes of death, including heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer disease, and unintentional injuries.2,4 We examined the leading causes of death in the US, overall and in various age groups, from March 2020 to October 2021. Methods We obtained final national death certificate data for 2020 and provisional data for 2021 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (accessed May 5, 20225). We excluded data more recent than October 2021 because they were incomplete. We determined the 5 leading causes of death by year and age group, and compared the period March to December 2020 with the period January to October 2021. Because the data are publicly available, the study did not require institutional review board review. Results From March 2020 to October 2021, heart disease (20.1%), cancer (17.5%), COVID-19 (12.2%), accidents (6.2%), and stroke (4.7%) were the most common causes of death in the US. There were 2.875 million deaths in March to December 2020 and 2.855 million deaths in January to October 2021; the 5 leading causes of death were the same in each year. Among those older than 1 year, the number of deaths increased across age groups. Deaths from cancer, heart disease, and COVID-19 accounted for the largest number of deaths in every group aged 55 years and older (Table, Figure). The leading 3 causes of death in these age groups were the same in 2020 and 2021. Among people aged 85 years and older, COVID-19 was ranked as the second leading cause of death in 2020 (110 000 deaths, 12.8% of deaths), and third in 2021 (69 000, 8.9% of deaths). Among those aged 45 to 54 years, COVID-19 was the fourth leading cause of death in 2020 (17 000 deaths, 10.4% of deaths), following heart disease, cancer, and accidents; in 2021, however, it was the leading cause of death (30 000 deaths, 16.8% of deaths). In both time periods, accidents accounted for the largest number of deaths in every age group 1 to 44 years. Compared with 2020, COVID-19 increased from the fifth (6100 deaths) to the second leading cause of death (13 000 deaths) among those aged 35 to 44 years in 2021, became the fourth leading cause of death in 2021 among those aged 25 to 34 years (5000 deaths), and those aged 15 to 24 years (1100 deaths). Discussion From March 2020 to October 2021, COVID-19 accounted for 1 in 8 deaths in the US and was a top 5 cause of death in every age group aged 15 years and older. Cancer and heart disease deaths exceeded COVID-19 deaths overall and in most age groups, whereas accidents were the leading cause of death among those aged 1 to 44 years. Compared with the 2020 time period, deaths from COVID-19 in the 2021 time period decreased in ranking among those aged 85 years or older but increased in ranking among those aged 15 to 54 years, and became the leading cause of death among those aged 45 to 54 years. The increased ranking of COVID-19 as a leading cause of death in some age groups is consistent with a downward age shift in the distribution of COVID-19 deaths in the US in 2021 compared with 2020,6 perhaps driven by higher COVID-19 vaccination rates in 2021 in the oldest age groups. The pandemic also has had indirect effects on other causes of death in the US. From 2019 to 2020, death rates increased for heart disease, accidents, stroke, Alzheimer disease, and diabetes.2 Potential explanations are fear of accessing health care or misattribution of COVID-19 deaths to other causes.4 Accidental deaths (including drug overdoses and unintentional alcohol poisoning), assault, and suicide remain major causes of death in the US, particularly in younger age groups; the pandemic may have contributed to some of these deaths. Our analysis was limited by potential misclassification of the cause of death and incomplete death data for 2021, although we included a lag of 6 months to increase the completeness of the provisional data. Moreover, because our analysis only extended through October 2021, it does not include deaths that occurred during the Omicron wave of the pandemic of late 2021 and early 2022.

        "text":"AMA News Wire What doctors wish patients knew about the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine There\u2019s a fourth COVID-19 vaccine option in town: Novavax. The availability of the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine offers another option for people who may have been hesitant about getting vaccinated. But with its approval so late in the pandemic, some may wonder what distinguishes the Novavax option from other COVID-19 vaccines. Knowing those differences may be a deciding factor for hesitant individuals. Advancing public health The AMA leads the charge on public health. Our members are the frontline of patient care, expanding access to care for underserved patients and developing key prevention strategies. Join the AMA The AMA\u2019s What Doctors Wish Patients Knew\u2122 series provides physicians with a platform to share what they want patients to understand about today\u2019s health care headlines, especially throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. In this installment, Sandra Fryhofer, MD, an Atlanta general internist and chair of the AMA Board of Trustees, discusses the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine. Dr. Fryhofer also serves as the AMA\u2019s liaison to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and is a member of ACIP\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine Work Group. For primary vaccination only For primary vaccination only \u201cWe now have a third type of vaccine in the fight against COVID,\u201d Dr. Fryhofer said during an episode of the \u201cAMA COVID-19 Update\u201d about the Novavax vaccine. \u201cA two-dose series of Novavax protein subunit COVID vaccine is now recommended for unvaccinated\u201d individuals who are 12 or older \u201cfor primary vaccination against COVID-19.\u201d But it is important to note that \u201cNovavax has to be used for both doses in the primary series,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can't mix and match with a different product or type.\u201d It\u2019s not new technology It\u2019s not new technology \u201cThis vaccine contains harmless spike protein subunits with an adjuvant added to boost immune response. And, unlike mRNA vaccines, protein-based vaccines do not contain any genetic material,\u201d said Dr. Fryhofer. \u201cOur vast experience with protein subunit vaccines should be reassuring to those who worry about the newness of mRNA vaccine technology.\u201d \u201cThis protein-based platform is new for COVID vaccines but it's not really new. This technology has been around for more than 30 years,\u201d she said, noting \u201cit\u2019s already been used in making other vaccines, for example, for flu, hepatitis B and whooping cough.\u201d Related Coverage Rapid collaborations drive research in COVID-19 and beyond Novavax is not available for boosters yet Novavax is not available for boosters yet \u201cNovavax can only be used as a primary series\u201d because the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \u201chas not authorized it as a booster yet,\u201d said Dr. Fryhofer. \u201cHowever, there's a lot of interest in the prospect of using Novavax as a booster, especially since mRNA vaccines don't seem to be that durable.\u201d But Novavax has submitted booster data to the FDA. Meanwhile, \u201cFDA representatives said that booster data would be reviewed very quickly, as quickly as possible, once that data is submitted,\u201d she said. \u201cThe company also announced that it started a study in May looking at Novavax boosters after an mRNA primary vaccine series,\u201d Dr. Fryhofer explained. \u201cThis study has five different arms and will test various types of Novavax boosters\u2014the original version, as well as Omicron-specific, monovalent and bivalent boosters\u2014so more to come. Effectiveness of Novavax is tricky Effectiveness of Novavax is tricky \u201cThe study data submitted to FDA says, overall, it was about 90% effective at preventing COVID,\u201d said Dr. Fryhofer. \u201cHowever, it did not seem to work quite as well in those 65 and older. Vaccine efficacy in this older group was 79%. \u201cAnd for some unexplained reason for which it doesn't make any physiological sense, vaccine efficacy in those of Hispanic ethnicity was also a little lower at 77%,\u201d she added, noting \u201chere\u2019s the catch: The studies submitted to FDA were done before Omicron started circulating.\u201d Because of that, \u201cwe just don\u2019t know how it will work against Omicron,\u201d Dr. Fryhofer said. \u201cThe Omicron surge started in December 2021 and still dominates. Omicron's BA.5 sublineage now makes up\u201d 80% and BA.4 makes up a little more than 5% \u201cof specimens tested, and who knows what variant is next on the menu.\u201d \u201cThe Novavax studies were done during a time when the Alpha variant was predominant, and the South Africa study showed that Novavax was only 51% effective against the Beta variant,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cwe really can't compare vaccine effectiveness of Novavax to that of mRNA vaccines based on the data that we currently have available.\u201d Expect typical side effects Expect typical side effects \u201cJust like the mRNA vaccines, these vaccines are reactogenic, so expect fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, headache, maybe some nausea, vomiting, maybe a little fever,\u201d said Dr. Fryhofer. \u201cThese side effects usually go away within one to two days.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, as we've seen with the mRNA vaccines, there have been reports of myocarditis and pericarditis after Novavax during the clinical trials and also in early post-authorization data,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that the risk of heart complications is higher after COVID disease than after mRNA COVID vaccination among males and females of all ages. \u201cHowever, we can't directly compare myocarditis rates between Novavax and mRNA vaccines based on currently available data,\u201d Dr. Fryhofer added. \u201cNow, in the Novavax clinical safety study, there were only four to six cases identified out of more than 40,000 vaccine recipients. \u201cAs of the beginning of May of 2022, nearly 750,000 doses of Novavax had been administered in other countries and global post-marketing safety data have revealed 36 cases of myocarditis or pericarditis.\u201d \u201cMyocarditis risk was addressed by the FDA in its guidance fact sheets, and FDA explains the chance of myocarditis is very low, but it can occur usually within 10 days following vaccination,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt also says patients who have chest pain, shortness of breath, the fast heartbeat, heart fluttering or a pounding heart should seek medical care right away.\u201d \u201cPost-authorization safety monitoring will continue and will be so important in further defining myocarditis risk,\u201d Dr. Fryhofer noted. Novavax is easy to store and use Novavax is easy to store and use \u201cIt comes in 10-dose vials, and it's preservative free. A dose is half a cc and contains 5 micrograms of protein subunit antigen along with 50 micrograms of a proprietary adjuvant Matrix-M, which boosts the immune response,\u201d said Dr. Fryhofer, adding it is given \u201cintramuscularly in the deltoid muscle.\u201d \u201cNovavax has several logistical advantages. It's easy to store, easy to prepare and easy to administer,\u201d she said. \u201cYou store it at regular refrigerator temperatures but don't freeze it. No dilutions necessary, but vaccine has to be discarded if it's not used within six hours after the first puncture of the vial.\u201d Related Coverage Omicron and BA.5: Questions patients may have and how to answer You can wait longer between doses You can wait longer between doses \u201cIn the study, vaccine doses were administered three weeks apart. However, CDC guidance says you can extend the interval between doses to as long as eight weeks,\u201d said Dr. Fryhofer. \u201cThis extended interval guidance is based on data from mRNA vaccines. There are no specific data on extended intervals for Novavax and this is all based on the mRNA vaccine studies.\u201d \u201cSome studies of mRNA vaccines have indicated a lower risk of myocarditis and greater immune response with that extended interval,\u201d she said. \u201cThe eight-week interval could be considered, especially in young adult males, to reduce potential for myocarditis and at the same time optimize vaccine effectiveness. \u201cThis extended interval recommendation does not apply to those with immunocompromised conditions,\u201d Dr. Fryhofer added. \u201cCDC recommends sticking to that three-week interval for patients with immunocompromised conditions so we can get their immune protection built up as quickly as possible.\u201d Be mindful of vaccine coadministration Be mindful of vaccine coadministration There\u2019s some \u201cgood news\u201d about coadministration of flu and COVID-19 vaccines, said Dr. Fryhofer. \u201cIt's fine to give flu shots and COVID vaccines at the same time, and that also goes for the Novavax vaccine. \u201cAlso, there's no problem giving Novavax or any of the other COVID vaccines with other vaccines with one exception: orthopoxvirus vaccines,\u201d she added, noting that while \u201cwe're in the middle of a monkeypox outbreak \u2026 ACAM2000 and JYNNEOS are the two vaccines available for orthopoxvirus viruses.\u201d Unfortunately, \u201cACAM2000 has been linked to myocarditis. We don't know if there's an increased risk of myocarditis with JYNNEOS yet, but if you've received a dose of one of these orthopox vaccines, CDC suggests waiting four weeks to get a COVID vaccine dose,\u201d Dr. Fryhofer explained. \u201cHowever, if you've already received a COVID vaccine and you're now at risk of monkeypox due to exposure, no need to wait. Go ahead and get the monkeypox vaccine dose now. \u201cAnd remember, Novavax and other COVID vaccines are reactogenic and can have significant side effects,\u201d she said. \u201cThe shingles vaccine\u2014Shingrix\u2014also is very reactogenic, so you might want to think twice about getting both shingles vaccine and COVID vaccine on the same day.\u201d",

        "text":"Key Points Question Is the COVID-19 pandemic associated with a decrease in the number of cancer screening tests globally? Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 39 publications, the screening types analyzed were associated with a significant overall decrease (\u221246.7%, \u221244.9%, and \u221251.8% for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening, respectively) from January to October 2020. This decrease showed a U-shaped trend with a negative peak in April 2020 (\u221274.3% for mammography and \u221269.3% for colonoscopy and fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test) and in March 2020 for Papanicolaou test or human papillomavirus test (\u221278.8%). Meaning COVID-19 pandemic measures were associated with widely reduced cancer screening services, which was possibly associated with delayed cancer diagnosis and increased cancer mortality. Abstract Importance Public health services, including cancer screening tests, have been affected by the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic. Objective To investigate the pandemic\u2019s association with cancer screening worldwide. Data Sources In this systematic review and meta-analysis, databases such as PubMed, ProQuest, and Scopus were searched comprehensively for articles published between January 1, 2020, and December 12, 2021. Study Selection Observational studies and articles that reported data from cancer registries that compared the number of screening tests performed before and during the pandemic for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis Two pairs of independent reviewers extracted data from the selected studies. The weighted average of the percentage variation was calculated between the 2 periods to assess the change in the number of cancer screening tests performed during the pandemic. Stratified analysis was performed by geographic area, period, and type of setting. The systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was the weighted average percentage variation in the number of screening tests performed between January and October 2020 compared with the previous period. Results The review comprised 39 publications. There was an overall decrease of \u221246.7% (95% CI, \u221255.5% to \u221237.8%) for breast cancer screening, \u221244.9% (95% CI, \u221253.8% to \u221236.1%) for colorectal cancer screening, and \u221251.8% (95% CI, \u221264.7% to \u221238.9%) for cervical cancer screening during the pandemic. For all 3 cancers, a U-shaped temporal trend was identified; for colorectal cancer, a significant decrease was still apparent after May 2020 (in June to October, the decrease was \u221223.4% [95% CI, \u221244.4% to \u22122.4%]). Differences by geographic area and screening setting were also identified. Conclusions and Relevance A summary estimate of the downscaling of cancer screening tests since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic is provided in this systematic review and meta-analysis. This could be associated with an increase in the number of avoidable cancer deaths. Effective interventions are required to restore the capacity of screening services to the prepandemic level. Introduction In 2020, according to GLOBOCAN estimates, 19.3 million new cancer cases and approximately 10 million cancer deaths occurred owing to breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer, which are the first, third, and seventh most prevalent cancers worldwide, respectively.1 Screening programs help to detect cancer at early stages or precursor lesions, leading to decreased mortality. In the past few years, especially in low- to medium-income countries,2 cancer screening and prevention protocols have had a remarkable impact on public health. However, major events, such as natural disasters and epidemics, can negatively affect screening rates and access to health care infrastructures and facilities,3 increasing the burden of cancer mortality. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a suspension of many nonurgent medical services was imposed all over the world. Affected services concerned, for example, family planning and abortion4; HIV prevention, testing, and care5; cancer prevention; specialistic treatments such as delays or deferrals in oncologic surgery, systemic therapy, and radiotherapy; and visits for oncologic patients.6 Consequently, cancer screening programs have been temporarily interrupted in most countries. Although these measures may have led to a reduction in COVID-19 transmission,7 their association with public health must still be determined.8 Because the lockdown restrictions have been heterogeneous in their beginning date and duration, we performed a systematic review of studies that analyzed the variation in the total number of examinations for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening performed since the beginning of the epidemic in comparison with the prepandemic period. Our aim was to quantify the global variation of cancer screening procedures during the lockdown period. Methods Search Strategy and Selection Criteria We conducted our systematic review and meta-analysis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline.9 We developed the study question by following the patients or the PICO (population, intervention, comparison, and outcome) and study design framework. This study is part of a larger project aimed at assessing the global effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with cancer, including not only cancer screening but also cancer diagnosis, diagnostic tests for cancer, therapies for oncologic patients, and first visits and follow-up visits for oncology patients. The search string was unique for all these outcomes. We launched the search string on PubMed, ProQuest, and Scopus, without language restriction, for articles published between January 1, 2020, and December 12, 2021. The search string was made using Boolean operators (AND, OR) and Medical Subject Headings terms and their builder options, if relevant, to improve the search results. Searches were performed with the following terms: neoplasms, diagnosis, drug therapy, radiotherapy, surgery, therapy, diagnosis, epidemiology, prevention and control, early detection of cancer, COVID-19, and organization and administration. We included observational studies and articles that reported data from cancer registries. We chose articles including a comparison between the periods before and after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with results indicated as number of screening tests performed, percentage variation between the 2 periods, or rate of screening. Studies were excluded if data on at least 1 of these comparisons were not available. We included only studies in which the 2 compared periods were explicitly stated. If the comparison was made between 2 or more pre\u2013COVID-19 periods, we selected the closest period as a reference (eg, we considered 2019 if data for both 2019 and 2018 were available). Data Collection and Quality Assessment Our database search and study selection process are outlined in the flow diagram (Figure 1). We found a total of 3630 total articles: 998 articles on PubMed, 1471 on ProQuest, and 1161 on Scopus. We collected initial references in citation files, removed duplicates (1007 articles), and began our screening process of the remaining 2623 articles. We initially excluded articles in languages other than English, French, Spanish, or Italian, and also reviews, meta-analyses, or case reports (245 articles). After this process, studies were first reviewed by title and then by abstract. Finally, we examined the full text of each article against eligibility criteria, and we collected 140 studies for all the outcomes of the research project (screening, diagnosis, diagnostic tests, visits, and therapies). Results on cancer screening were reported in 39 articles. We decided to analyze the types of cancer screening recommended for the general population by the US Preventive Services Task Force.10-12 We excluded screening types performed for high-risk individuals (eg, lung cancer screening13) and those with lower-grade recommendation (eg, prostate cancer screening14). The title and abstract of the articles were independently reviewed by 2 pairs of reviewers (F.T. and G.C.; M.A. and L.A.) for inclusion in the first screening phase, followed by the full-text screening phase against eligibility criteria. Disagreements among reviewers in the initial abstract screening phase and full-text review were resolved through discussion with a fifth reviewer (P.B.). Two pairs of reviewers (F.T. and G.C.; M.A. and L.A.) perused the prepared checklist to extract from each article the following information: name of the first author, year of publication, country and type of setting (hospitals and private centers were considered clinic based; local and national cancer registries were considered population based), site of cancer, type of screening analyzed (mammography, research of blood in the stool with the fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test, colonoscopy, Papanicolaou test, or human papillomavirus test), and absolute number or rate of screening tests performed in the analyzed period or percentage variation between intervals before and after the beginning of the pandemic. In particular, for colorectal cancer screening, we analyzed data from both types of screening (fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test and colonoscopy) separately and together. We performed an assessment of the quality and risk of bias of all the studies included, using 9 of the 10 items of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme for qualitative research,15 for a maximum score of 10 points. Studies obtaining less than 7 points were considered inadequate and excluded (no article was excluded because of a low-quality score). eTables 1 through 3 in the Supplement list the articles included in the present analysis and their major characteristics and quality assessment. Statistical Analyses For each type of screening, we calculated the weighted average of the percentage variation between screening tests performed before and after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The weight was calculated with the natural logarithm of the number of daily events in the prepandemic period (ie, daily_screen_precovid obtained by dividing the number of screening tests in the prepandemic period by its duration in days: weight = ln [daily_screen_precovid]). We used the logarithm because of the great variability in the number of tests between studies. We used the absolute value to avoid negative weights. Some studies did not provide the absolute number of screening tests performed in the prepandemic period, but only the measure of variation between the period being examined and the reference period. For these studies, to calculate the weight, we imputed a value of daily_screen_precovid as the mean value of this variable in the studies having the same type of setting and cancer screening. We divided the pandemic period into 5 intervals (all referring to 2020) based on the beginning date of the COVID-19 period being examined in each article as follows: period 1 from January 1 to February 29; period 2 from March 1 to March 31; period 3 from April 1 to April 30; period 4 from May 1 to May 31; and period 5 from June 1 to October 31. This partition of the 5 periods was based on temporal distribution of the available observations along the pandemic period and on the trend of COVID-19 spread and pandemic measures in most countries.16 We did not include studies in which the pandemic period started before January 2020. We did not find studies in which the pandemic period of observation started after October 2020. Studies could contribute to more than 1 period, but not more than once in each period. Then we calculated weighted averages for each interval. Because each period analyzed was determined only by the starting date of the observation, for some studies it could include an interval longer than the predefined periods (eg, an observation that considered January 1 as the starting date and May 31 as the end date was included in the first period). An additional analysis was performed for specific geographic areas and for type of setting. We finally fitted ordinary least-squares linear model using Newton-Raphson (maximum likelihood) optimization with percentage change as dependent variables and terms for type of structure, geographic area, and period as independent variables. In the linear regression model, 2-sided P values were used, with P < .05 considered statistically significant. Because a percentage reduction could not be lower than \u2212100%, we limited the values of the 95% CIs to \u2212100.0% in case they exceeded it. We considered the funnel plot and performed the Egger regression asymmetry test to assess publication bias.17 No ethics committee approval and no patient consent were necessary because the study was restricted to publicly available data. For all statistical analyses, we used Stata, version 16.1 (StataCorp). P values of differences of means are based on the t test, those of differences of proportions are based on z scores, and P tests of multivariate analyses are those derived from the regression generalized linear models for the respective variables. Results Data on race and ethnicity, as well as demographic information for the study population, were not available. eTable 4 in the Supplement shows the weighted average variation of screening tests performed by cancer type, and Figure 2 shows the corresponding temporal trend. Breast Cancer The average variation of breast cancer screening from January to October 2020 was \u221246.7% (95% CI, \u221255.5% to \u221237.8%) compared with the pre\u2013COVID-19 period. The maximum decrease in breast cancer screening occurred in April 2020 (\u221274.3% [95% CI, \u221291.8% to \u221256.7%]), whereas after June there was no significant reduction (\u221213.0% [95% CI, \u221233.0% to 7.1%]). The weighted average of the screening variation was \u221262.0% (95% CI, \u221275.1% to \u221249.0%) for clinic-based settings and \u221241.6% (95% CI, \u221253.2% to \u221230.0%) for population-based ones. The difference between the 2 types of structures was confirmed to be statistically significant in the linear regression analysis (adjusted difference, 18.9%; 95% CI, 2.0% to 35.9%; P = .03) (Table 1). We divided the geographic areas for breast cancer screening according to the distribution of the countries analyzed in each study: North America (United States and Canada), South America (Brazil, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay), and Europe (Italy, France, and Turkey). In North America, the number of breast cancer screening tests decreased by \u221244.6% (95% CI, \u221257.4% to \u221231.8%) during the COVID-19 period. In this geographic area, the decrease was \u221219.4% (95% CI, \u221255.1% to 16.2%) in January and February, \u221249.9% (95% CI, \u221266.5% to \u221233.2%) in March, \u221286.7% (95% CI, \u2212100.0% to \u221273.5%) in April, \u221237.8% (95% CI, \u221262.3% to \u221213.4%) in May, and 0.8% (95% CI, \u221214.1% to 15.7%) from June to October 2020. Europe presented an average variation of \u221267.7% (95% CI, \u2212100.0% to \u22129.3%), and South America presented an average variation of \u221251.1% (95% CI, \u221267.5% to \u221234.7%). As shown in Table 1, the decrease during April was significant (\u221253.8%; 95% CI, \u221275.4% to \u221232.2%; P < .001), using January and February as the reference; studies from Europe also reported a larger decrease compared with those from North America (\u221235.6%; 95% CI, \u221265.9% to \u22125.3%; P = .02). Colorectal Cancer The overall decrease in the number of colorectal cancer screening examinations performed throughout the period from January to October 2020 compared with the pre\u2013COVID-19 period was equal to \u221244.9% (95% CI, \u221253.8% to \u221236.1%). In particular, the decrease for colonoscopy was \u221252.5% (95% CI, \u221266.3% to \u221238.8%), and the decrease for fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test was \u221237.8% (95% CI, \u221249.9% to \u221225.8%). The weighted average variation was \u221251.5% (95% CI, \u221269.5% to \u221233.6%) in clinic-based settings and \u221243.7% (95% CI, \u221254.9% to \u221232.6%) in population-based ones. Compared with the prepandemic period, the global evolution by period showed the greatest decrease in April 2020 (\u221269.3% [95% CI, \u2212100.0% to \u221236.9%]) and only a partial recovery during the last months of the analysis (\u221223.4% [95% CI, \u221244.4% to \u22122.4%]) from June to October (eTable 4 in the Supplement). We analyzed the 3 main geographic areas, including North America (United States and Canada), Asia (India, China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore), and Europe (Italy, France, and the United Kingdom). The weighted average variation during the entire COVID-19 period was \u221245.1% (95% CI, \u221259.3% to \u221231.0%) for North America, \u221234.6% (95% CI, \u221258.1% to \u221211.1%) for Asia, and \u221252.4% (95% CI, \u221269.4% to \u221235.3%) for Europe. For North America, the greatest decrease was in April (\u221283.0% [95% CI, \u2212100.0% to \u221255.8%]), whereas in Asia the most remarkable decrease in screening rates was observed in January and February (\u221236.2% [95% CI, \u221277.9% to \u22125.6%]). In linear regression analysis, April had a greater decrease compared with January and February (\u221238.3%; 95% CI, \u221263.6% to \u221212.9%; P = .003), whereas there was no statistically significant difference between geographic areas (Table 2). Cervical Cancer For cervical cancer screening, the weighted average variation was equal to \u221251.8% (95% CI, \u221264.7% to \u221238.9%). The maximum decrease observed among the 5 periods was in March (\u221278.8% [95% CI, \u221299.3% to \u221258.3%]). In the linear regression model (Table 3), a significant decrease was observed in March compared with January and February (\u221238.9%; 95% CI, \u221275.2% to \u22122.5%; P = .04). Clinic-based studies showed a greater reduction than the population-based ones: \u221251.7% (95% CI, \u221277.3% to \u221226.1%) and \u221251.9% (95% CI, \u221267.8% to \u221235.9%), respectively. In North America (United States and Canada), the weighted average variation was \u221244.7% (95% CI, \u221273.8% to \u221215.7%), whereas in South America (Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Puerto Rico), it was \u221262.4% (95% CI, \u221273.3% to \u221251.5%). Discussion This study investigated the association of the COVID-19 pandemic measures with cancer screening by systematic review. Against a global pattern showing an increasing trend for colorectal cancer screening and a slight decrease for cervical cancer screening and mammography from 2000 to 2015,18 our study found a marked association with a decrease in the number of tests performed for the 3 cancer types (\u221246.7%, \u221244.9%, and \u221251.8% for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening, respectively) in all geographic areas considered during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Beyond the decision to interrupt all cancer screening programs, the main factors that may have caused this reduction were stay-at-home orders, people's fear of the infection, avoidance of nonurgent medical treatment and care, limited access to in-person medical examinations, and the reorganization of hospital departments.6 The greater decrease for the Papanicolaou test or human papillomavirus test and colonoscopies may be attributable to more invasive techniques used to diagnose these tumors compared with mammography for breast cancer and fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test for colorectal cancer. We identified a similar pattern by period for breast and colorectal cancer screening, with a U-shaped trend having a negative peak in April 2020 and an attenuation in May. This trend was largely attributable to the lockdown measures in numerous countries and territories worldwide. As illustrated through the stringency index of the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker,16 in April 2020 most of the countries had implemented COVID-19 measures. All 3 types of cancer screening showed the least reduction from June to October. A significant feature of the present study is the analysis of different geographic areas; Europe presented a larger decrease in mammograms compared with North America (Table 1), which could be associated with the fact that in the United States, they are mostly performed through private health insurance,18 whereas in Europe, they are usually provided as part of the public health care system. Conversely, the decrease was similar for colorectal cancer screening between the 2 regions. The restrictions that occurred in Europe could therefore have had a greater association with the cancer screening procedures that imply an actual attendance to the health care structure providing the service. Our results indicated that invasive colorectal cancer screenings (colonoscopies) had a larger decrease than noninvasive ones, such as fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test (\u221252.5% vs 37.8%, respectively), which were more easily performed as a colonoscopy alternative.19 Unlike the global decrease in colorectal cancer screening, Asia presented the most remarkable decrease in January and February; however, the variability of COVID-19 epidemiology and restrictive measures between Asian countries20,21 complicates the interpretation of this matter. The percentage variation for cervical and breast cancer screening was greater in South America compared with North America (\u221262.4% vs \u221244.7% and \u221251.1% vs \u221244.6%, respectively); however, we cannot assume that it will result in worse consequences for Latin America owing to its weaker health care system before the pandemic.22 An important aspect of our review was the consistency of results across a wide spectrum of health care settings. The association between the epidemic and cancer screening was greater in studies based in hospitals or other clinic settings than in population-based studies, especially for breast cancer screening (\u221262.0% vs \u221241.6%; P = .03), which could be explained by clinic-based studies\u2019 considering only the decrease in the number of patients who actually attended the screening test vs population-based studies\u2019 including also patients who did not participate in screening programs in the prepandemic period. There was no evidence of publication bias either qualitatively according to funnel plot asymmetry or quantitatively with the Egger regression test. The aim of identifying early neoplastic lesions in the case of breast cancer and precursor lesions in the case of colorectal and cervical cancer was to decrease the incidence of invasive cancer.23 The most concerning potential effect of a decrease in cancer screening is an increase in cancer mortality, as estimated in the United States.24 The interruption of cancer screening could delay diagnosis of tumors, causing a shift to more advanced stages at diagnosis. Furthermore, this could be associated with increased avoidable cancer deaths, aggravate the patients\u2019 discomfort and disease burden, and be associated with increased workload for medical personnel and increased costs for the health care system.8,25,26 In addition, a portion of the postponed screening tests could be impossible to recover because during the suspension some patients exceeded the maximum age to be included in screening programs. Limitations Our review has some limitations. First, considerable heterogeneity between countries was present in terms of screening protocols,27 services\u2019 accessibility and participation of the target population, lockdown measures, and incidence of COVID-19 and its temporal trend; all of these factors could not be considered in our statistical analysis. Second, the attribution of an observation to 1 of the 5 periods was based only on its beginning date, which might lead to nondifferential misclassification. Future studies on variations in screening numbers will need to be performed to clarify long-term implications and adopt adequate public health strategies. Third, in some studies we had to impute the number of daily events to calculate the weight. Conclusions The results of our systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that there is an association between the COVID-19 pandemic and a reduction in breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer screening, with a U-shaped temporal pattern. Although for breast and cervical cancer screening, the data suggest a recovery after May 2020, the decrease in colorectal cancer screening persisted until October 2020. This is expected to be associated with an increase of avoidable advanced cancers and cancer-related deaths. Further investigation regarding cancer diagnosis and cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic is required. Back to top Article Information Accepted for Publication: May 18, 2022.

        "text":"Human participants All research was approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board (nos. IRB00058507, IRB00057983 and IRB00058271) and was performed in accordance with all relevant guidelines and regulations. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or, if they were unable to provide informed consent, from designated healthcare surrogates. Healthy individuals (n = 20) were recruited using promotional materials approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board. Individuals with COVID-19 (n = 19) were recruited from Emory University Hospital, Emory University Hospital Midtown and Emory St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital (all Atlanta, USA). All nonhealthy individuals were diagnosed with COVID-19 by PCR amplification of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA obtained from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs. Individuals with COVID-19 were included in the study if they were between 18 and 80 years of age, were not immunocompromised and had not been given oral or intravenous corticosteroids during the preceding 14 days. Peripheral blood was collected in either heparin sodium tubes (for PBMCs) or serum tubes (for serum) (both BD Diagnostic Systems). Baseline individual demographics are included in Supplementary Table 1. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at Emory University. Banked frozen plasma from patients with ARDS (n = 28) was obtained as previously described56. PBMC cell isolation and plasma collection Peripheral blood samples were collected in heparin sodium tubes and processed within 6 h of collection. PBMCs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation at 1,000g for 10 min. Aliquots from the plasma layer were collected and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. PBMCs were washed twice with RPMI at 500g for 5 min. Viability was assessed using trypan blue exclusion, and live cells were counted using an automated hemocytometer. Flow cytometry Isolated PBMCs (2 \u00d7 106) were centrifuged and resuspended in 75 \u03bcl FACS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS)) and 5 \u03bcl Fc receptor block (BioLegend, no. 422302) for 5 min at room temperature. For samples stained with anti-IgG, it was observed that Fc block inappropriately interfered with staining, so a preincubation step of the anti-IgG alone for 5 min at 22 \u00b0C was added before the addition of the block. Next, 25 \u03bcl of antibody cocktail (Supplementary Table 3) was added (100 \u03bcl staining reaction), and samples were incubated for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. Cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in a PBS dilution of Zombie NIR fixable viability dye (BioLegend, no. 423106). Cells were washed and fixed in 0.8% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 22 \u00b0C in the dark before a final wash and resuspension for analysis. Cells were analysed on a Cytek Aurora flow cytometer using Cytek SpectroFlo software. Up to 3 \u00d7 106 cells were analysed using FlowJo v.10 (Treestar) software. Analysis software Computational analysis was carried out in R (v.3.6.2; release 12 Dec 2019). Heat maps were generated using the pheatmap library (v.1.0.12), with data prenormalized (log-transformed z scores calculated per feature) before plotting. Custom plotting, such as that for mutation frequency violin plots, was performed using the ggplot2 library for base analysis, followed by postprocessing in Adobe Illustrator. Alluvial plotting was performed using the ggalluvial package with postprocessing in Adobe Illustrator. Clonotype connectivity analysis was carried out using the R-based \u2018vegan\u2019 package and then visualized with \u2018pheatmap\u2019 before postprocessing in Adobe Illustrator. Statistical analyses were performed directly in R or in GraphPad Prism (v.8.2.1). Analyses of the single-cell VDJ annotated sequences were performed using the Immcantation tool suite (http:\/\/www.immcantation.org) v.4.1.0 pipeline in Docker. This suite contains SHazaM for statistical analysis of SHM patterns as described in Gupta et al., 2015 and BASELINe for analysis of selection pressure as described in Yaari et al.26. Visualizations were generated in R using the SHazaM package (v.1.0.2) and then postprocessed in Adobe Illustrator. Flow cytometry and sorting of B cell subsets for repertoire sequencing Frozen cell suspensions were thawed at 37 \u00b0C in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum and then washed and resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS with 2% fetal calf serum). The cells were incubated with a mix of fluorophore-conjugated antibodies for 30 min on ice. The cells were washed in PBS and then incubated with live\/dead fixable aqua dead cell stain (Thermo Fisher) for 10 min at 22 \u00b0C. After a final wash in FACS buffer, the cells were resuspended in FACS buffer at 107 cells per ml for cell sorting on a three-laser BD FACS (BD Biosciences). For single-cell analysis, total ASCs were gated as CD3\u2212CD14\u2212CD16\u2212CD19+CD38+CD27+ single live cells, whereas naive B cells were gated as CD3\u2212CD14\u2212CD16\u2212CD19+CD27\u2212IgD+CD38+ single live cells. For bulk sequencing preparations, B cells were enriched using StemCell\u2019s Human Pan-B Cell Enrichment Kit (no. 19554; negative selection of CD2, CD3, CD14, CD16, CD36, CD42b, CD56, CD66b and CD123). CD138+ ASCs were enriched further using CD138+ selection beads according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, no. 130-051-301). Single-cell V(D)J repertoire library preparation and sequencing Cells were counted immediately using a hemocytometer and adjusted to 1,000 cells per microlitre to capture 10,000 single cells per sample loaded in the 10\u00d7 Genomics Chromium device according to the manufacturer\u2019s standard protocol (Chromium Next GEM Single Cell V(D)J Reagent Kits, v.1.1). The 10\u00d7 Genomics v2 libraries were prepared using the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 5\u2032 Library Construction Kit per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq (paired-end; 2 \u00d7 150 bp; read 1:26 cycles; i7 index: 8 cycles, i5 index: 0 cycles; read 2: 98 cycles) such that more than 70% saturation could be achieved with a sequence depth of 5,000 reads per cell. Carbodiimide coupling of microspheres to SARS-CoV-2 antigens Two SARS-CoV-2 proteins were coupled to MagPlex microspheres of different regions (Luminex). Nucleocapsid protein expressed from Escherichia coli (N-terminal His6) was obtained from Raybiotech (230-01104-100) and the RBD of spike protein expressed from HEK293 cells was obtained from the laboratory of J. Wrammert63 at Emory University. Coupling was carried out at 22 \u00b0C following standard carbodiimide coupling procedures. Concentrations of coupled microspheres were confirmed by Bio-Rad T20 Cell Counter. Luminex proteomic assays for measurement of anti-antigen antibody Approximately 50 \u03bcl of coupled microsphere mix was added to each well of 96-well clear-bottom black polystyrene microplates (Greiner Bio-One) at a concentration of 1,000 microspheres per region per well. All wash steps and dilutions were accomplished using 1% BSA, 1\u00d7 PBS assay buffer. Sera were assayed at 1:500 dilution and surveyed for antibodies against nucleocapsid protein or RBD. After a 1-h incubation in the dark on a plate shaker at 800 rpm, wells were washed five times in 100 \u03bcl of assay buffer using a BioTek 405 TS plate washer before applications of 3 \u03bcg ml\u22121 PE-conjugated goat antihuman IgA, IgG and\/or IgM (Southern Biotech). After 30 min of incubation at 800 rpm in the dark, wells were washed three times in 100 \u03bcl assay buffer, resuspended in 100 \u03bcl assay buffer and analysed using a Luminex FLEXMAP 3D instrument running xPONENT 4.3 software. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) using combined or individual detection antibodies (anti-IgA, anti-IgG or anti-IgM) was measured using the Luminex xPONENT software. The background value of the assay buffer was subtracted from each serum sample result to obtain MFI minus background (net MFI). Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was carried out using Prism (GraphPad). For each experiment, the type of statistical testing, summary statistics and levels of significance can be found in the figures and corresponding legends. All measurements shown were taken from distinct samples. High-throughput surface plasmon resonance High-throughput surface plasmon resonance (HT-SPR) data were collected through single-cycle kinetic analysis against either SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid or spike trimer (S2P). mAbs were prescreened for antigen binding through Luminex-based multiplex binding assessment (above), and select antibodies were analysed for binding affinity. All data were collected with 1:1 referencing collected in real time on a Nicoya Alto HT-SPR instrument with eight referenced channels running in parallel on carboxyl-coated sensors. Ligand binding and regeneration conditions for each antigen were as follows. S2P SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer was resuspended in Tris acetate buffer, pH 4.5, and immobilized on an EDC\/NHS-activated carboxyl sensor for 5 min at 50 \u03bcg ml\u22121. Regeneration of the sensor was performed using glycine HCl, pH 2.5, for 1 min. Nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein was resuspended in Tris acetate buffer, pH 6, and immobilized onto an EDC\/NHS-activated carboxyl sensor for 5 min at 50 \u03bcg ml\u22121. Regeneration of the sensor was performed using glycine HCl, pH 3, for 1 min. All single-curve kinetics were performed with five threefold analyte dilutions with final concentrations between 222 nM and 914 pM. Analytes were run in phosphate-buffered saline (0.05% Tween), with interactions collected at 25 \u00b0C. B cell binding assay Two to three million HD PBMCs were incubated with 5 \u03bcg of mAb at 40 \u00b0C for 30 min. The cells were washed with 30\u00d7 volume FACS buffer (1\u00d7 PBS, 2% FBS) and subsequently stained with antibodies against CD3, CD19, CD27, IgD and IgG, as well as with Zombie NIR. Staining was completed with 0.8% paraformaldehyde for fixation. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on a CytoFLEX (BD Biosciences). Dead cells and doublets were excluded. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of mAb (IgG) was determined on a naive B cell population. mAb selection and production mAb were selected for production from the single-cell repertoire data obtained from patient ICU-1. Individual cells were clustered into clonotypes and then assessed for clonotype size, nucleotide mutation frequency, isotype and connectivity between sorted populations. Through progressive filtering, clonotypes were selected that met the following criteria: (1) contained at least one IgG1 member; (2) had at least one member with a mutation frequency of <1%; (3) had at least one member in the ASC compartment or the CD27\u2212 compartment or contained members in both. With those criteria met, all expanded clonotypes (>5 individual cells identified in the clonotype) and all IGHV4-34+ members were selected for mAb production and screening (55 clonotypes in all). The most frequently repeated BCR sequence from each clonotype was provided to Genscript for antibody production on a standard IgG1 backbone. Clinical autoreactivity testing For autoimmune biomarker analysis, frozen plasma was shipped on dry ice to Exagen, Inc., which has a clinical laboratory accredited by the College of American Pathologists and certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Thawed plasma was aliquoted and distributed for the following tests: antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (QUANTA Lite; Inova Diagnostics) and indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) (NOVA Lite; Inova Diagnostics); anti-dsDNA antibodies were also measured by ELISA and were confirmed by IFA with Crithidia luciliae; extractable nuclear antigen autoantibodies (anti-Sm, anti-SS-B\/La IgG, anti-Scl-70 IgG, anti-U1RNP IgG, anti-RNP70 IgG, anti-CENP IgG, anti-Jo-1 IgG and anti-CCP IgG) as well as RF IgA and IgM were measured using the EliA test on the Phadia 250 platform (ThermoFisher Scientific); IgG, IgM and IgA isotypes of anticardiolipin and anti-\u03b22\u2010glycoprotein, as well as anti-Ro52, anti-Ro60, anti-GBM, anti-PR3 and anti-MPO, were measured using a chemiluminescence immunoassay (BIO-FLASH; Inova Diagnostics); anti-CarP, anti-RNA-pol-III, and the IgG and IgM isotypes of anti-PS\/PT were measured by ELISA (QUANTA Lite; Inova Diagnostics), whereas C-ANCA and P-ANCA were measured by IFA (NOVA Lite; Inova Diagnostics). All assays were performed following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. BALF plasma cell gene expression To assess the constant region gene expression in BALF-derived ASCs, data were retrospectively analysed from the UCSC data browser available at https:\/\/www.nupulmonary.org\/covid-19-ms1. In brief, these data are representative of ten ICU patients whose BALF was collected within 48 h of intubation, with total isolated cells sequenced using the 10\u00d7 single-cell transcriptomics platform. Patient information and full methods are available in the associated manuscript25. MENSA generation Medium enriched for newly synthesized antibodies (MENSA) was generated by isolating, washing and culturing ASC-containing PBMC from blood using a modified procedure previously described (REF). PBMC were isolated by centrifugation (1,000g; 10 min) using Lymphocyte Separation Media (Corning) and Leucosep tubes (Greiner Bio-One). Five washes with RPMI-1640 (Corning) were performed to remove serum immunoglobulins (800g; 5 min), with erythrocyte lysis (3 ml; 3 min) after the second wash and cell counting after the fourth. Collected PBMCs were cultured at 106 cells ml\u22121 in R10 medium (RPMI-1640, 10% Sigma FBS, 1% Gibco antibiotic\/antimycotic) on a 12-well sterile tissue-culture plate for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO 2 . After incubation, the cell suspension was centrifuged (800g; 5 min), and the supernatant (MENSA) was separated from the PBMC pellet, aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for testing. COVID-19 multiplex immunoassay SARS-CoV-2 antigens were coupled to MagPlex microspheres of spectrally distinct regions by carbodiimide coupling and tested against patient samples as previously described. Results were analysed on a Luminex FLEXMAP 3D instrument running xPONENT 4.3 software. MFI using combined or individual PE-conjugated detection antibodies (anti-IgA\/anti-IgG\/anti-IgM) was measured using the Luminex xPONENT software on enhanced PMT setting. The background value of assay buffer or R10 medium was subtracted from the serum and plasma or MENSA results, respectively, to obtain an MFI minus background (net MFI). Serum and plasma samples were tested at 1:500 dilution, and MENSA was tested undiluted. Selection of antigens MENSA and serum samples Four recombinant SARS-CoV-2 antigens were used in this study. The nucleocapsid protein (catalogue no. Z03480; expressed in E. coli), the S1 domain (amino acids 16\u2013685; catalogue no. Z03485; expressed in HEK293 cells) of the spike protein, and the S1-RBD (catalogue no. Z03483; expressed in HEK293 cells) were purchased from GenScript. The S1-NTD (amino acids 16\u2013318) was custom synthesized by GenScript. Each protein was expressed with an N-terminal His6-tag to facilitate purification (>85% pure) and appeared as a predominant single band in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. mAb testing RBD (catalogue no. Z03483; expressed in HEK293 cells) and nucleocapsid protein (catalogue no. Z03480; expressed in E. coli) were purchased from GenScript (same as the first version). S1 (catalogue no. S1N-C52H3; HEK293), S2 (catalogue no. S2N-C52H5; HEK293) and S1-NTD (catalogue no. S1D-C52H6; HEK293) were purchased from ACROBiosystems. The carboxyl terminus sequence of ORF3a (accession: QHD43417.1, amino acids 134\u2013275 plus N-terminal His6-Tag) was sent to Genscript for custom protein expression in E. coli.

This light is the remnant signature of the cosmic beginning \u2014 a dense, hot fireball that burst forth and created all mass, energy, and time. The primordial cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation has since traveled some 13.8 billion years through the expanding cosmos to our telescopes on Earth and above it. But the CMB isn\u2019t just light. It holds within it an incredible wealth of knowledge that astronomers have been teasing out for the past few decades. \u201cIt\u2019s the earliest view we have of the universe,\u201d Princeton University cosmologist Joanna Dunkley previously explained to Astronomy. \u201cAnd it gives us so much information because all the things that we now see out in space \u2014 the galaxies, the clusters of galaxies \u2014 the very earliest seeds of those, we see in this CMB light.\u201d Extracting these clues from the CMB has taken multiple generations of telescopes on the ground, lofted into the atmosphere, and launched into space. In the mid-1960s, when Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered the CMB\u2019s pervasive microwave static across the sky, it appeared identical everywhere. It would take satellites launched above Earth\u2019s obscuring atmosphere to map that microwave glow to precisions on the order of millionths of a degree. Specifically, three satellites \u2014 COBE, WMAP, and Planck \u2014 revealed that our current cosmos, which is complex and filled with clusters of galaxies, stars, planets, and black holes, evolved from a surprisingly simple early universe.

Our COVID-19 resources: October 24, 2022 Key takeaways: New Omicron subvariant XBB does not appear to have immune escape with BA.5 , meaning individuals who were previously infected with BA.5 will maintain their immunity against the new subvariant. New analyses also show all subvariants of Omicron appear to be less severe than previous variants. The surge in Germany may be due to subvariants BQ.1 or BQ.1.1, and will likely spread to other parts of Europe in the coming weeks. We predict winter seasonality in the Northern Hemisphere will bring more infections, but not a large increase in deaths. New research on long COVID shows it has affected millions worldwide and is more common in women than men. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity In this week's analysis of COVID from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, we have spent a lot of time in the last few weeks recalibrating our model to reflect the differences between waves of variants for the infection-detection rate, the infection-hospitalization rate, and the infection-fatality rate. And when we put that together with all the new data that we've seen in the last three or four weeks, our attention gets drawn to two key areas. New subvariant XBB First, the XBB-related surge in hospitalizations in Singapore, and it's a pretty rapid increase in hospitalizations over a short period of time. Very nice analyses out of Singapore, telling us that it's more transmissible. But the good news is that also, those analyses suggest there's no immune escape with BA.5. In fact, people who have been infected in the last three months, presumably with BA.5, had essentially almost no incidence of XBB. So that's really good news in terms of its potential for global spread and impact. It still, however, means that those individuals and communities that have had low past Omicron infection, particularly BA.5, are at risk for the surge. The other good news out of Singapore is that it doesn't seem to be more severe \u2013 if anything, slightly less severe. Our recalibration exercise has confirmed what we thought almost 10 months ago, that Omicron, including BA.5, remains more than 10-fold less severe than previous waves of the COVID pandemic. And that has continued for all these Omicron sub-lineages so far. Surge in Germany and predictions for Europe and the Northern Hemisphere The other area of concern is the really rapid increase in hospital admissions, as reported in Germany \u2013 higher rates of hospital admission now than at any time previously in the COVID epidemic. The last couple of days it looks like COVID admissions may be coming down, but of course, there's this question of lags in reporting. So we'll wait and see if that holds true in the next three or four days. But the increase has already been quite large. We should expect that to spread, probably due to BQ.1 or BQ.1.1 \u2013 not 100% sure because of lags in reporting of the sequencing data \u2013 but it should spread to other parts of Europe, we suspect. Again, we don't have good data at all separating out admissions due to COVID as compared to admissions with COVID, and so we're not really sure how consequential this big surge in Germany is and how consequential it will be for the rest of Europe. We do expect that the sort of smaller, slow increases in the northeast of the US, as an example, are the beginning of people going back to school, winter seasonality starting to kick in, so we continue to expect considerable increases in infections through the Northern Hemisphere winter, but without major increases in deaths due to COVID \u2013 but quite a number of deaths with COVID, and same for hospitalizations. So until we learn more about the German surge and whether it's associated with more severe disease, we remain reasonably, cautiously optimistic that the winter will have more infections, maybe not so many cases because of the great reduction in the infection-detection rate, and we should see quite a few hospitalizations with COVID, but not so many due to COVID. Continuing zero-COVID strategy in China China is the last big question mark, where there have been mixed signals from different groups in China about whether or not the zero-COVID strategy would continue. President Xi Jinping has made it clear, at least publicly, that they plan to continue with the zero-COVID strategy. And so when we build that into the models, we don't see a huge surge in China. But given the large number of susceptible individuals in China and the very low levels of past infection, the potential for an explosive epidemic always remains there, especially if the zero-COVID strategy was backed off even a little bit within China. So that's the sort of main pictures that we see around the pandemic or COVID transmission in different parts of the world. There are some interesting, but too early to tell, signals in some countries in sub-Saharan Africa that maybe cases are also going up there, but that could also be related to the data challenges that we've seen throughout the pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa. New findings on long COVID Now, the last thing to comment on is we published this week in JAMA , our analysis with many collaborators of all the cohorts that were available on long COVID, and put those together to get an overall picture about long COVID. Read the research And just to reiterate the key findings there, the risk of long COVID is very much related to severity of disease, much higher if you went to hospital, even higher if you had to go to the ICU. Long COVID is more common in women than men, and it's quite low risk in children. And with the milder variants, we also expect to see a lower probability of long COVID. Despite that, we're seeing 5% or 6% of individuals having long COVID symptoms at three months. That fortunately drops down to about 1% at 12 months. But if you take the huge volume of COVID infections in the world, those numbers do translate into a very large number of individuals globally who will be suffering at three months from symptoms of long COVID and many millions suffering even at 12 months with symptoms of long COVID just because of the incredible ubiquity of COVID infection. Even though the probabilities are not that high, individual by individual, they add up to a big toll on society. September 16, 2022 Key takeaways: Long COVID is a real problem. It affected 17 million people in the European region in 2020 and 2021. The more severe a case of COVID is, the higher risk of developing Long COVID. Adults are at higher risk than children. About 6% of people with COVID still had symptoms after three months and 1% had symptoms after a year. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity We are very interested in the evidence base around Long COVID and have had a number of initiatives running for about a year and a half, trying to get the various researchers around the world that have cohort studies on Long COVID, getting them to work together and pool that information and figure out what the actual risks of Long COVID are. And there are future studies that are planned and will be coming out about that joint work with many groups. This week we used those insights with the World Health Organization European Regional Office and put out an analysis of what the implication of the cohort studies were for the European region. [We found] 17 million people in 2020 and 2021 with Long COVID, where Long COVID is defined as symptoms running three months or more and, at the heart of it, it does point out that Long COVID is a real problem. Read the press release from WHO It's quite considerable numbers globally and by region. And what we do know from the examination of the cohort studies is that it seems to be a higher risk of Long COVID the more severe your case was, so much higher probabilities of Long COVID if you went to the ICU or you were hospitalized, than if you had mild symptoms. It's also a higher risk in adults than in children. And the risk, there's some people who have, by definition three months of symptoms. And then there are still some people in the cohort studies that have symptoms at 12 months. So some Long COVID can be very long indeed. The numbers, roughly speaking, are running about 6%, everyone coming, having had COVID, having symptoms at three months, of Long COVID and 1% having symptoms at the end of a year. Given the huge volume now of Omicron infection in the world, we don't have the implication of the number of patients with Long COVID. It could be very large and could be a real burden on society and on health systems, and on the individuals who are affected. But we don't have the same cohort data available yet specifically, or very much less, specifically about Omicron. Given the general relationship between severity and risk of Long COVID we hope that those probabilities I was quoting for Long COVID should be somewhat lower for Omicron. Regardless, it is a big issue and it is important to some of the initiatives that we've seen in the European region of coming up with strategies to help patients manage Long COVID symptoms and I'm sure we will see similar discussions around Long COVID in other regions of the world as the epidemic continues. September 12, 2022 Key takeaways: New projections through January 1: infections will drop until October and then increase in the winter. Current projections show a relatively low death toll, but a new variant could change that. Our recommendations: Maintain and improve surveillance for new variants. Encourage boosters. Provide access to antivirals for older and high-risk individuals. Determine which social distancing mandates have the greatest impact if a new, more severe variant emerges that warrants their use. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity New challenges with modeling In this week's release on modeling the COVID-19 epidemic, we've got updated forecasts out to January 1. The analysis proves to be quite challenging the farther into the epidemic we go, because the balance of how many people are able to get infected and thus likely to transmit the virus and sustain transmission is incredibly driven by two factors: first, the pace at which immunity wanes, whether from vaccination or recent infection. Two aspects of that, 1) the pace at which immunity wanes for infection, which is faster than immunity waning for severe disease, so we get these differential effects on waning, and then 2) the degree of cross-variant immunity between sub-variants of Omicron. So, how much can BA.5 infect people who have been infected previously with BA.2 or BA.1? Those are not, especially for BA.5, well understood. There are not that many published studies on waning immunity and cross-variant immunity, so we have to try to infer that from neutralizing antibody studies, as well as the behavior of BA.1 and BA.2 compared to the Delta variant. So that generates quite a lot of uncertainty, and as we try to fit each model to the available data for each country, it is a harder challenge. It is a more brittle analysis. The latest results: a winter increase in infections but not reported cases We've been able to do that for all locations, and what we see in those forecasts is that for many places in the world, particularly the Northern Hemisphere, outside of China, we expect infections to keep dropping as they have in recent weeks in most places, and then start to go back up in October through to the end of the year. The increase of infections \u2013 and this is in the absence of any new variant, so this is really just BA.5 \u2013 the increase in infections could be quite large in the winter. But the infection-detection rate, the fraction of infections that get reported as a case in official data, is now down to an incredibly low level. In some parts of the Northern Hemisphere, it's below 2%; in others it may be as high as 5%. That means that this big increase in infections we are modeling for the fall and the winter will not translate into big increases in cases, but we may see a larger increase in hospital admissions where COVID is present. Because of routine testing of all hospital admissions in most countries, we see a bigger increase in some places \u2013 Norway is a great example of this \u2013- in hospital admissions \u2013 this was the case with BA.5 over the summer \u2013 than in reported cases. We expect that phenomenon to continue, given the current rules around universal testing for hospital admissions, where hospital admissions are essentially a measure of community transmission, as opposed to a measure of severe disease with COVID, since there are a lot of incidental hospital admissions, people coming in for some other cause who happen to be COVID-positive. Current projections show relatively low death toll, but a new variant could change that Because of the sustained low infection-fatality rate that we're seeing for BA.5 due to vaccination and past infection, and access in some jurisdictions to antivirals like Paxlovid, we expect not so many deaths, only just over 50,000 in the Northern Hemisphere and a larger amount in the rest of the world. We expect that the death toll to be quite modest through to January 1. If a new variant comes along, all bets are off as we've seen with the emergence of Omicron this year, or even a new sub-variant where there's considerable reduction in cross-variant immunity. China's zero-COVID strategy continues The one exception to this description of generally not a high level of threat around the world in terms of severe disease is what will continue to play out in China, where the zero-COVID strategy continues to be pursued and we continue to see renewed outbreaks in different provinces. If the Chinese leadership decide to back away from the zero-COVID strategy, we would see a very large outbreak of Omicron, and, given low vaccination in the 80+ population in many provinces, we would see quite considerable deaths as we saw in Hong Kong earlier in the year. But that's very much a function of what the government will do. They've committed so far publicly to zero-COVID, so we don't expect a big toll yet. But that could change through the fall as the economic consequences of zero-COVID continue to unfold. Our recommendations for managing the next phase of the epidemic That's our roundup of what's happening around the world. In terms of strategies to manage it, number one is to stay vigilant for governments and to maintain surveillance, maybe improve it, do more what the UK has done with the Office of National Statistics Infection Survey , so you know about true transmission. And to take a worldwide view of surveillance, so when a new variant or sub-variant shows up, the world is ready to act if needed. Secondly, encourage boosters in those who are due for a booster as immunity does wane even for severe disease. Thirdly, make sure those who are older or at high risk get access to antivirals as needed. And then, a very cautious approach to trying to look at the evidence to date to figure out which of the social distancing interventions had the biggest impact, so that in a worst-case scenario, if a severe variant shows up with considerable immune escape, we can use those social distancing mandates and measures that are most likely to be beneficial and minimize the economic, educational, and social disruption in the future. July 22, 2022 Key takeaways: COVID-positive hospital admissions are rising in the US. However, it is unclear whether the hospitalizations are due to COVID, or if individuals tested positive after being admitted for other reasons. However, it is unclear whether the hospitalizations are due to COVID, or if individuals tested positive after being admitted for other reasons. We remain optimistic that there will not be a large amount of severe COVID , due to widespread use of Paxlovid and the likelihood of many hospitalizations to be incidental infections. , due to widespread use of Paxlovid and the likelihood of many hospitalizations to be incidental infections. Our recommendations: It is not necessary to implement mask or social distancing mandates at this time. National surveillance systems should track the underlying cause of hospital admissions. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity Rising COVID-positive hospital admissions in the US In some jurisdictions in the US, there are rising reported hospital admissions with COVID, and in some cases, examples of rising deaths. This has caused considerable policy discussion about whether it is time to reinstate mandates, such as the consideration of mask mandates in LA County. The challenge that we have in understanding what's happening with BA.5 is that this is a very common infection. We see lots of evidence of considerable transmission in the community that is not translating into a big surge in reported cases, largely because we believe there is so much rapid antigen testing at home. Many COVID hospitalizations are incidental We do see rising numbers of hospital admissions, and the challenge \u2013 as we've spoken about before \u2013 is distinguishing incidental, that is people coming to the hospital with some other problem, who happened to be COVID-positive when they get tested, from true COVID admissions. Unfortunately, in this country we don't have data on COVID admissions where they are positive for COVID and that's the reason for admission. Some hospital systems are reporting this. There are reports from USC, for example, in LA County, that fully 90% of hospital admissions are incidental, meaning it is quite possible that we don't have reason to be that concerned about BA.5 transmission. Read more in Nature \u00bbHeart disease after COVID: what the data say Unlikely to be many cases of severe COVID It could well be, because of high levels of immunity in the population from vaccination and from past infection, and quite widespread use of Paxlovid, if we look at the data in the US, that there isn't really cause for concern that there's going to be a large amount of severe COVID. This means, perhaps, that it is not the time, at this point, to be considering imposition of new mandates such as mask mandates or social distancing mandates. The situation globally This is a phenomenon we're seeing in other countries as well \u2013 it's not unique to the United States. There are reports from New Zealand, for example, in the last few days, of a marked increase in daily deaths. And again, this challenge is there, as well as in many countries in Europe \u2013 Norway is another example \u2013 where incidental from underlying is not being distinguished. It could well be just that BA.5 is a very common infection. The only way we're going to resolve this for the future is if national surveillance systems make the effort to track hospitalizations and distinguish them by the underlying cause of admission. We remain reasonably positive and optimistic about the course of BA.5 in the US and elsewhere. We do see early signs that it may have peaked already in the US and is starting to come down \u2013 that's not true for every state, but in general it does seem to be following the course that we've seen in other countries around the world. July 20, 2022 Key takeaways: BA.5 is surging around the world, particularly in North America, Latin America, and Europe. We anticipate waves to last around four to six weeks, based on other locations\u2019 experiences. particularly in North America, Latin America, and Europe. There are several new challenges for accurately tracking the pandemic: More people are using at-home tests and not reporting infections to public health authorities, making it difficult to gather accurate case counts. Countries have different requirements for COVID testing upon hospital admission, leading to variation in rates of hospitalization due to COVID, compared to incidental cases. Our policy recommendations: Encourage booster shots. Make antivirals available to all, particularly those in low-resource settings. High-risk individuals should consider social distancing and masking as transmission increases. Do not focus on getting vaccines to those who have never been vaccinated. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity BA.5 surges around the world In this week\u2019s COVID update from IHME, we\u2019re looking at the surges around the world \u2013 particularly in North America, Latin America, and most of Europe \u2013 that are traced to the combination of mobility levels being above pre-COVID levels, mask use globally down to 16% or less, and of course the BA.5 subvariant of Omicron. Interpreting the data has new challenges It is becoming increasingly challenging to make complete sense of the COVID-19 surges in different countries, as we see very different biases in different countries coming into reported cases, hospital admissions, and reported deaths. For reported cases, we're seeing very modest to no increase in some countries in Europe, as compared to hospitalizations. Same in the United States. And we believe that's because of the widespread use of rapid antigen tests at home and in most countries people not reporting that to the public health authorities. They don't get into official case numbers. In contrast, for hospital admissions \u2013 if you want an extreme example of this disconnect, look at Norway, where hospital admissions have gone up dramatically and yet cases have gone up only slightly. But for hospital admissions, most countries have required COVID testing for all patients, at least most high-income countries, meaning that you detect a quite substantial number of individuals who have COVID, but have gone to hospital for some other reason. We tend to call these \"incidental\" COVID admissions. The degree to which there will be incidental COVID admissions depends on how much transmission there is broadly in the community. So we should expect under Omicron, the problem of incidental hospital admissions is dramatically larger than with a much more severe variant, such as Delta in the past, where there was less transmission in the community, and those coming to hospital who were COVID-positive were much more likely to be there simply because of symptoms of COVID. So, challenging interpretation. And if you want to have a contrast to Norway, look at Mexico, where the increase in reported cases is dramatically higher than the increase in hospital admissions. We don't know if that's because there isn't the same testing requirement, of universal testing for COVID for hospital admissions, or if there is less home use of tests. Either way, it's becoming quite a bit harder to make sense of the available data. Should we be very concerned about BA.5? Probably not. In the places that started earlier \u2013 South Africa, Portugal \u2013 that had their BA.5 waves begin before other locations, we've seen from the beginning to the peak, it lasts about four to six weeks. So in many cases where countries are three-four weeks into these surges, we do think that we will see \u2013 and the models tend to back up that observation \u2013 we do expect to see peaks coming in the near future. Meaning that there isn't a reason to be particularly alarmed about BA.5, Our long-range models also suggest in the Northern Hemisphere that we may \u2013 in the absence of a new variant that changes the whole story \u2013 we might expect to see a further winter or late fall Omicron wave start up again in October, and that would be a pattern that we saw in 2020 and 2021. Whether that happens depends very much on this balance between waning immunity from prior vaccination \u2013 so whether or not people get a fourth booster in places where they have access to that, whether they want a fourth booster \u2013 versus waning immunity from infection and the protection provided from infection with Omicron for either other subvariants or future variants. All of that means to say that it's possible that we have a late-fall surge again from Omicron because of waning immunity. Government policy recommendations The strategies available for governments right now are less on getting people who have never been vaccinated, vaccinated. The data out there suggest very few people anywhere in the world who want to be vaccinated have not been, even in low-resource settings. As opposed to the available strategies, which might focus more on getting those who are willing to be vaccinated, who have been previously vaccinated, getting a further booster to enhance their protection against severe disease as that also wanes over time; broader use of antivirals, particularly in low- and middle-income countries; and then, for those individuals who are at particularly high risk, consideration of social distancing and masking as transmission in your community goes up. As a backdrop to all of those strategies, the thing that we are learning, that is, two and a half years into this pandemic, is just how important surveillance is. Paradoxically, in many ways, the data stream that we have today is worse than a year ago because of some of the issues that I started with in this video about home testing, and different definitions of incidental versus underlying COVID for both hospitalization and death. So, very challenging on the surveillance side, but absolutely critical that we keep monitoring the pandemic and trying to do it in as comparable a fashion as possible, and particularly keeping track of new variants. That's our roundup of what we see in our analysis this week in the release of our new forecasts. June 24, 2022 Key takeaways: In the United States , COVID is currently on the decline, but BA.4 and BA.5 could change that. Why? Vaccines are less effective at preventing infection from BA.4 and BA.5. Previous infection provides less immunity against BA.4 and BA.5. Mobility is increasing while mask wearing declines. , COVID is currently on the decline, but could change that. Our recommendations for the US: Individuals should get another COVID vaccine and a flu vaccine before the winter. States should secure antivirals, especially for those at high risk. Governments should continue screening for new variants. On a global level, we see a rise in some European countries, including France, Germany, and the UK. The future is still unclear in China, but much of the population remains susceptible to severe infection. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity BA.4 and BA.5 in the United States In the United States, reported cases, infections, hospitalizations, and deaths continue to decline. This is the pattern we have seen in the northeastern states. It is spreading across the United States, and we project that this will continue all the way until the end of September, when we are expecting another wave. We are concerned in the United States because of the fast spread of BA.4 and BA.5 \u2013 they are escape variants in that it seems from the new studies we are looking at, that the vaccines are less effective in preventing infection of BA.4 and BA.5. They are still very effective in preventing severe illness and mortality, but we are concerned that with BA.4 and BA.5 spreading fast with the relaxation of mandates and with the patterns we are seeing in some European countries where there is a third wave, we are concerned that there is potential here for another bump or increase in cases in the coming months. We will update our models the second week of July, and we will include all this new information in our models. We will then predict if we see a third wave or not, and how big it will be and how long it will last. In general, we're heading in the right direction in the United States. Our recommendations for the US We're expecting a surge in winter, and the focus right now in the United States should be on vaccinating people and getting the booster, and then getting another vaccination before the winter, especially also with flu. We expect that flu season could be bad because we haven't seen flu in the past three years. Our recommendation would be to take another COVID-19 vaccine before winter and a flu vaccine. Also, our recommendation is for every state to secure enough antivirals in order to make sure they are provided to infected people, especially those who are at high risk, elderly, and people with immunocompromise or with risk factors, chronic conditions, to make sure that we reduce the burden on our hospitals and we save lives. And, of course, continue screening and making sure that we don't lose track of what's circulating in our country, and if there is an increase in cases due to another variant or pre-existing variant, we take the measures that are necessary to stop the spread of this virus. Cases rising in Europe On the global level, what we are seeing right now is a rise in some European countries. We see a third wave, driven mainly by BA.4 and BA.5, and the relaxation of mandates, increased mobility, and low mask wearing. We see the third wave with an increasing number of reported cases, and we see it in France, in Germany, beginning of it in the UK, in Greece, in Israel. That's a big concern for us because what has happened before in Europe has happened here in the United States, and we could see here in the United States a third wave, especially from BA.4 and BA.5, which are increasing as a percentage of the variants that are circulating. We know right now from several studies that previous infections from other variants do not provide as much immunity against Omicron and BA.4 and BA.5. Also, the vaccines are less effective in terms of preventing infection. They're still effective against severe illness and mortality for BA.4 and BA.5. So putting these two together, we are very much concerned that we could see potentially in the United States another wave after the second wave due to BA.4, BA.5, relaxation of the mandates, increased mobility, and low mask wearing. We will update our numbers in July, most likely the second week due to the holiday, and we will take into account all this new information about the spread of BA.4 and BA.5 in Europe, and the new studies that are showing less effect of the vaccine against BA.4 and BA.5. Future unclear in China China remains a big mystery for us \u2013 we don't know what's going to happen in China. They're successful so far in containing the virus, but this could change as soon as they change their policy and open up the country because they have had fewer infections because of their success before, their vaccine is not as effective, and much of their elderly population is not vaccinated. So we could see a rise of cases in China as well. June 10, 2022 Key takeaways: Global infections are increasing : Secondary Omicron waves are hitting parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Portugal, and the United States. We expect a peak in June, but another surge in the northern hemisphere in September, leading to an additional 120,000 deaths by October. : Secondary Omicron waves are hitting parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Portugal, and the United States. We expect a peak in June, but another surge in the northern hemisphere in September, leading to an additional 120,000 deaths by October. Outlook still uncertain for China: Strict lockdown measures continue to be successful but come at an economic cost. Strict lockdown measures continue to be successful but come at an economic cost. Policy insights and recommendations: Mask mandates in parts of the US are unlikely to have a large effect. We must maintain global surveillance to prepare for the possibility of new variants. Ensure access to antivirals for vulnerable individuals. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity Global infections are increasing In this week's release from IHME of our COVID forecasts, there are some key observations of what's happening around the world and what we see coming in the models. Globally, we're starting to see the estimated number of infections go up again, and that's driven by secondary Omicron waves in a number of places in sub-Saharan Africa, in a wide array of locations in Latin America, from Quintana Roo, other states in Mexico, through to a number of states in Brazil and all the way in between. There are also some small increases in states in India, and perhaps most concerning is a quite substantial secondary wave of Omicron in Portugal, related to the BA.5 variant with an associated meaningful increase in the death rate, which we have not generally seen with these secondary Omicron waves in Europe and the northeast of the US. The last place where there is some secondary increase from Omicron is some of the Southern states in the US and some of the states in the Midwest. Omicron peak is expected in June Despite these increases, we remain reasonably sure in the modeling that they will peak sometime in June, given what we've seen in Europe with the secondary waves, and what we've seen in the northeast of the US, as well as what we saw with the BA.4-5 wave in South Africa. So we expect these to be short-lived, and to not really alter the global trajectory over the next few months. An outbreak in China could have a major global impact The big question mark remains, at the global level, what happens in China. We are assuming that strict lockdown measures will continue through to October, and that they will be, as they have been to date, successful. The reporting of 11 cases today in Shanghai will raise the real questions about the economic toll in China from the strict lockdown policies, but so far there's no indication of a change from the leadership in China. 120,000 deaths expected globally by October 1 Putting all that together in our forecasts, we do not see large numbers of deaths. Although when you add it up around the world, still about 120,000 deaths are to be expected between now and October 1. The other insight that comes from the modeling is that we expect to see numbers starting to go back up again in the Northern Hemisphere in early September or late September, likely leading into increases \u2013 modest increases \u2013 in the fall. Mask mandates in the US unlikely to have a big impact There is some concern in parts of the US seeing secondary Omicron waves, such as in California, where some mandates have been put back in place, namely mask mandates, for example in Alameda county. As far as we can tell from both the modeling, as well as from the experience elsewhere of the secondary waves, we don't necessarily think that will have a big effect, nor is it necessary given the low infection-fatality rate and given the availability of antivirals, particularly, which should mean that we won't see a substantial increase in death. Some of the debate about this is getting still obscured, this many months into Omicron, because we are not getting good data that differentiates incidental hospitalizations \u2013 people coming to hospital with COVID-19, but that's not the reason for their hospitalization \u2013 from hospitalizations and deaths where COVID is the true cause. And without that it's very easy for a highly contagious and reasonably prevalent infection like Omicron to appear like the numbers are increasing substantially. Continuing surveillance for new variants and access to antivirals will be key Clearly all of this optimistic view over the next few months at the global level is predicated on the idea that there will not be a new variant that has immune escape and is more severe than Omicron. But of course, that is a distinct possibility and it highlights why maintaining global surveillance \u2013 so that if such a variant emerges, the world knows about it as soon as possible \u2013 is really crucial, as is preparing for access for the vulnerable for antivirals, because that's likely in the future to be the strategy that will make the biggest difference if a new variant comes along.

This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity Daily death toll declining globally This week at IHME in our update on COVID, we do not have a new model release. That will be coming next week, but we continue to monitor the pandemic. We are really reaching, at the global level, an extraordinarily low level of the impact of COVID. In fact, the death toll at the daily level has now reached the level we last saw around March 20, 2020. We continue to see this very favorable trend down. Low or declining cases in China, South Africa, Europe, and the US At the location level, the strict lockdown policy, zero-COVID strategy in China continues to work, although it has great economic effects. The reported cases, as far as we can tell in China, are now down to a very low level. We do expect in our modeling, and continue to expect, that it will be hard to sustain that, given the considerable number of susceptible individuals that are still in China. Elsewhere, where there were surges related to either BA.4 or BA.5 in South Africa, that's peaked and continues to decline. The BA.2 surges in Europe seem to have all peaked and are pretty much declining. Here in the US, as we expected, at the national level it appears that case reporting has peaked and is starting to come down, but of course that varies by location. The decline is more in the northeast. Other states are still on the upswing, but nationally we should start to see the numbers come down. We do continue to expect, in the absence of the emergence of a variant with considerable immune escape on Omicron, that we will see quite low numbers through the next few months. We must continue monitoring for new variants Of course, we've learned through the pandemic that the emergence of a new variant can completely change the story in a very quick manner. But for now, it does appear like those countries that are largely returning to pre-COVID levels of interaction and very low levels of mask use will continue to see low or even declining transmission, and certainly low or declining impacts in terms of death, given the slow but steady scale-up of the use of antivirals. So, there are very favorable conditions for the moment. We do believe it's important to keep up surveillance and to be ready on a country-by-country basis to respond with booster shots, with access to antivirals, and if a dangerous, high-severity new variant with immune escape emerged, to be able to reconsider other actions as well. May 27, 2022 Key takeaways: South Africa & China: Cases appear to have peaked and are now declining. Cases appear to have peaked and are now declining. United States: The increase in cases is slowing and expected to peak by early June. The increase in cases is slowing and expected to peak by early June. Current recommendations: Offer boosters to those who want them. Provide antivirals to at-risk individuals who get infected. Continue surveillance for potential new variants. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity Evidence of BA.4-5 cross-variant immunity in South Africa This week from IHME, we do not have a new release of our models, but we are continuing to track the evolution of the current pandemic. Of major areas of interest, in South Africa, the BA.4-5 related increase in cases has peaked and is coming down, which fits with the expectation that while there was some reduction in cross-variant immunity from BA.4-5 compared to previous waves of Omicron, it was not very large. Omicron under control in China Likewise, we're seeing that the measures put in place in China for strict lockdown, at least according to official data, continue to be successful, with case numbers coming down. Of course, the question will be whether or not there are going to be \u2013 as we expect, given the large volume of susceptible individuals \u2013 further Omicron outbreaks, and the need for other efforts at strict lockdown in China, still pursuing a zero-COVID strategy. Cases expected to peak in the US within a few weeks In the United States, the increase in cases, probably driven by behavioral relaxation, seems to be slowing. There is a spatial heterogeneity aspect to this, but for example, in our own hospital system at the University of Washington, our number of hospital admissions has peaked and is starting to come down, as an example of a place with one of these surges. So, as we've been expecting for many weeks, we do not think these current increases in the US will lead to large-scale increases in death, certainly, or hospitalization. We should see a peak about the end of May or early June at the national level. Current recommendations Pending the emergence of new variants that are more severe than Omicron, the current strategies of continuing to offer boosters to those who would like to get a booster, making sure that antivirals are available for those who are at risk who do get infected with Omicron, and continuing surveillance, are the most important aspects of monitoring the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. May 20, 2022 Key takeaways: Regional updates: China continues zero-COVID strategy and reports no increase in cases. South Africa may be reaching a peak of the BA.4\/BA.5 winter surge. The United States is experiencing an increase in Omicron cases \u2013 likely due to behavioral changes, and possibly due to re-infection with BA.2 \u2013 but not an increase in deaths. Mandates: We do not expect mandates to be widely re-implemented, outside of zero-COVID policies in China. We do not expect mandates to be widely re-implemented, outside of zero-COVID policies in China. Cross-variant immunity: New research suggests limited immunity against other variants after Omicron infection. However, immunity from vaccination and previous infection does provide strong protection from severe illness and death. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity China reports no increase in cases We do not have updated models this week, but we continue to monitor the unfolding of the pandemic around the world. Areas of ongoing interest are the approach to zero-COVID in China, which continues. Officially reported cases are actually not increasing, and they're maybe coming down, but stringent mandates are in place in many locations. From experience in other countries, we do expect at some point that Omicron will spread widely in China, but it is very much a question of when \u2013 and when the government decides to stop pursuing this zero-COVID strategy. Cases increasing in South Africa and United States Elsewhere in the world, we're seeing increases. The BA.4- and BA.5-related and winter-related increase in South Africa continues. It is certainly not as exponential as the original Omicron wave, but it does continue to increase. With some indication, it may be reaching a peak. In the United States, Omicron continues to increase in a number of states. That increase, again, seems to be like what we've observed in many countries in Europe, related to behavioral relaxation and possibly BA.2 re-infection of people who have had a prior Omicron infection \u2013 although it's perhaps easiest to account for through behavioral change. Mandates not expected to be reimplemented In neither case, neither what we saw in Europe nor what we're so far seeing in the United States, are we seeing an increase in death, which is very good news. That's likely because there is either vaccine-derived or infection-acquired immunity, so that people aren't fully immunologically naive, and perhaps because of the increased use of antivirals when individuals do become sick, which should have a marked effect on the death rate. We don't, at this point, think that there's reason for large-scale concern and also do not expect, with few exceptions, that there will be implementation of mandates in these jurisdictions, outside the zero-COVID strategy in China. New studies show limited immunity from Omicron infection One of the critical factors that do go into the long-range modeling, and even the short-range, is the extent to which Omicron infection provides protection against subsequent new variants, or even sub-variants of Omicron. There was a paper in Nature this week, which is a lab-based paper, based on the immune responses from serum from different types of patients, which suggests that there may be a limited cross-variant protection from Omicron infection. Read more in Nature \u00bbLimited cross-variant immunity from SARS-CoV-2 Omicron without vaccination We'll really want to wait and see when studies are able to start reporting, from actual infection in individuals, what sort of cross-variant immunity there is. Both from vaccine-derived immunity and infection-acquired immunity, the available studies suggest much lower protection against Omicron infection, pretty good protection against severe disease and death, but greatly reduced for infection. We'll have to wait and see whether that difference holds true for Omicron on Omicron by sub-variant, or even future variants, namely less protection against infection, but hopefully more protection against severe disease and death. That issue will have a profound effect on what the fall and winter may look like, as we do expect waning immunity, both from vaccines and infection-acquired immunity, plus indoor exposure and opportunities for transmission, that there should be increased transmission potential in November, December, and January, and the extent to which there is long-range protection from severe disease and death will have a marked effect on outcomes. May 16, 2022 - US reaches 1 million COVID deaths As the United States reaches this somber milestone, IHME director Dr. Christopher Murray reflects on the impact of COVID-19 around the world and how we can better prepare for future health threats. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity The US has officially surpassed the awful milestone of a million reported deaths from COVID. This is a number that I think very few of us thought would ever come to pass when the pandemic started to break in February of 2020. In fact, back then we thought a concerted response would mean that the number would be a tenth of that, or even less. Now, the true number of deaths from COVID is even larger. We think, based on looking at excess deaths, it's probably closer to 1.3 million deaths that have already occurred in the US, but by either metric, it's a staggering number. COVID has had a terrible toll, not just here in the US but around the world, with 6 million reported deaths and more than 18 million excess deaths; those deaths are distributed throughout the regions of the world and not just in North America or in Europe. We've entered a new phase of the pandemic, a phase where Omicron is much milder and a large fraction of the world's population has been infected with Omicron. The Omicron story has still to play out in China and North Korea, but in general we're entering this phase where people are going back to pre-COVID levels of interaction. Mask use is declining dramatically, and I think that's going to be the new normal. We will see continued Omicron transmission, and Omicron will come back in the winter if we don't see a new variant. But it's likely we will see a new variant, and so while we might think that the era of mandates and profound changes in behavior might be behind us, we certainly haven't seen the end of COVID-19. We should be thinking about how we manage COVID-19 new variants as they emerge and the critical role of continued use of boosters, vaccinating those who are still willing to be vaccinated but haven't been, and the new tools that we have like Paxlovid and potential other antivirals as they come along. All those combined mean, even if we have a new variant, we don't expect it to be as bad as it has been, which is good news. But it should give us pause to recognize the threat that we live with in the future, for either some remarkable new variant that will break through our current tools entirely, or new pathogens and new pandemics in the future. Hopefully, this extraordinary experience in the US will motivate the US government and other governments to invest in greater capabilities to respond to new threats; detect them earlier; have a more rational, thoughtful, but rapid response to those threats as they emerge; and then to figure out who are most vulnerable, whether it's the groups that are essential workers, or those that have some sort of comorbidity, or those that are elderly. Whatever it may be for a new threat, it's critical that we learn about protecting the most vulnerable for future rounds of threats as they emerge. At this terrible milestone, it is an opportunity for us to reflect both on what went wrong and how we can solve and prepare ourselves better for future rounds of COVID and future threats. May 12, 2022 Key takeaways: East Asia: As rapid transmission of Omicron unfolds in Taiwan, it seems inevitable that an outbreak will also occur in China. However, it is impossible to predict when that may occur as it depends on how long the government chooses to continue pursuing a zero-COVID strategy. As rapid transmission of Omicron unfolds in Taiwan, it seems inevitable that an outbreak will also occur in China. However, it is impossible to predict when that may occur as it depends on how long the government chooses to continue pursuing a zero-COVID strategy. United States: Cases are increasing, particularly in the Northeast and on the West Coast, due to returning pre-COVID behavior patterns. Short-term: We predict a small peak in May to early June, but no major surge until the winter. Long-term: We predict as many as 30% of the US population will get infected through the winter with Omicron due to declining immunity. However, we expect the consequences to be much, much lower because of antivirals. Cases are increasing, particularly in the Northeast and on the West Coast, due to returning pre-COVID behavior patterns. Global: Data from South Africa do not indicate that BA.4 and BA.5 will lead to a major global surge. Our recommended strategy for dealing with COVID on a global scale is securing access to antivirals for all. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity Omicron and the zero-COVID strategy in East Asia Last week in IHME\u2019s updated forecasts, we certainly were trying to take into account what\u2019s unfolding in East Asia with continued rapid expansion of the Omicron epidemic in Taiwan, and that continues to expand. There\u2019s this very challenging question of how Omicron will play out in China. The government is pursuing their zero-COVID strategy with lockdowns as needed. We have been expecting Omicron, since February, in our modeling to eventually break through these efforts because it has appeared that control efforts on Omicron have been generally less successful around the world than for previous variants. So far, these strict lockdown policies have kept Omicron numbers at a relatively low level. It's extremely hard to understand how the policy environment will play out in China. If they pursue strict lockdowns, it's possible they will keep Omicron transmission at a relatively modest level through to the fall. We do believe that it is inevitable there will be a large Omicron outbreak at some point in China, because maintaining a strict zero-COVID strategy is probably unsustainable as the year progresses, but it's impossible to know when that change in policy will occur. Increasing cases in the United States and predictions for the winter In the US, we're seeing increases in a number of parts of the country, particularly the Northeast, and some of the West Coast, in cases and hospital admissions. This is a pattern that follows what we\u2019ve seen in Europe as people's behavior goes back to pre-COVID levels, and there is a little bit of transition to BA.2 and perhaps BA.4 and BA.5 as they continue to spread. We do expect a modest increase in numbers. Our expectation is they will peak sometime in May or early June and then go back down. We don't expect a major surge from that. There have been reports from the White House of their efforts to model in the long term a large surge in infections. In our long-range models, which we do not release publicly, we do expect in the winter a return Omicron surge. Of course if there's a new highly infectious variant that's more severe, that would trump this pattern we expect. We expect a surge in the winter because of declining immunity from exposure to Omicron, as well as declining immunity from vaccination and perhaps not as high a rate of repeat boosters as we've seen for the third dose, going into the future. The consequences of a winter surge in the US should be much smaller because of Paxlovid and increasing availability of antivirals and use of antivirals. We certainly expect quite large numbers in the winter, not so much in the fall \u2013 perhaps as many as 30% of the US population getting infected through the winter with Omicron. But we expect the consequences to be much, much lower because of antivirals. We don\u2019t expect much in the way of government mandates, given the much lower ICU admission rate and death rate that should occur with these new strategies, particularly antivirals. Global strategy should be ensuring access to antivirals for all At the global level, there's been ongoing debate and concern about BA.4 and BA.5 in South Africa. There\u2019s not an exponential surge there; there's a very slow increase in numbers. We so far are not seeing any indication that BA.4 and BA.5 could be the driver of a major global surge in cases, but of course this warrants monitoring on a regular basis. Overall, in terms of general strategy globally, we've seemingly maxed out globally on the number of people who are unvaccinated that want to be vaccinated \u2013 as far as we can tell from the data, only about 3% of the world wants a vaccination that hasn\u2019t received one. A lot of that is concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, but still it's not a large percentage of the population. Perhaps the main strategy to deal with future variants is making sure that anyone who needs antivirals will get access to antivirals. There's a lot in that, both in terms of production of Paxlovid and health system infrastructure, and response patterns so that when somebody needs it, they can get it whether they're in a low-resource or high-resource setting. Those are our main observations on the epidemic as it continues to unfold. May 9, 2022 Key takeaways: Global: Mortality from COVID-19 is the lowest since April 2020. 3.1% of the population who wants a vaccine has still not received one, most in Africa. We must ensure equity in distribution of antiviral medication. Eid El-Fitr celebrations in Islamic countries could lead to a small increase in cases. Mortality from COVID-19 is the lowest since April 2020. United States: Reported cases and hospitalizations are increasing. We predict an additional 29,000 deaths by September. Home testing and delayed reporting of infections has made it more difficult to track COVID-19. We recommend: continuing surveillance for new variants, securing antiviral medication, preparing to return to mask use and physical distancing if another variant arises. Reported cases and hospitalizations are increasing. We predict an additional 29,000 deaths by September. China: The large percentage of elderly and unvaccinated people makes the population very susceptible to high mortality rates and overwhelmed hospitals if the zero-COVID policy fails. The current rise in Taiwan and previous surge in Hong Kong are warning signs of what could happen. The large percentage of elderly and unvaccinated people makes the population very susceptible to high mortality rates and overwhelmed hospitals if the zero-COVID policy fails. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity Projections and recommendations for the United States We have increased our projections to September 1. Right now in the United States we are projecting 1.02 million deaths by September 1. That's an additional 29,000 deaths from May 2, when we ran our programs. For the United States, the recommendations remain the same: We need to continue our surveillance and make sure we are doing enough sequencing to know what variants are circulating in the United States, and if BA.4 and BA.5 are being introduced in the US and how fast they are spreading. At the same time, we need to ensure that we have enough antiviral medications in order to distribute them. We know from their clinical trials that they reduce hospitalization and mortality, and they will reduce the pressures on our hospitals. Third, which is very important, if we are seeing a rise due to another variant in the United States, we should go back to wearing masks and physical distancing. In the United States we are seeing an increase in reported cases and hospitalizations. In some states, we are seeing the rate of increase in admissions to hospital is much higher than the rate of increase of reported cases. We believe that's due to the fact that many people are testing themselves at home and not reporting to their counties and not using the local labs, so we are not capturing these cases. BA.4 and BA.5 under study in South Africa We are monitoring closely what's happening in South Africa, the infections with BA.4 and BA.5. We don't know yet if they are immune escape and they are infecting people that have been previously infected by BA.2. It's too early to tell, and the fact that many people in South Africa have been infected by Omicron 4-5 months ago, it's possible that the waning immunity is resulting in the infection from BA.4 and BA.5. Chinese population remains susceptible, relying on zero-COVID policy At the global level, mortality from COVID-19 is the lowest since April 2020. The global trends are mainly dominated by what's happening in China. Right now we are seeing a rise in cases in Taiwan. China is continuing with its zero-COVID policy and we feel that they will be able to control COVID-19 for a while. However, the economic pressure may not allow them to continue with such a policy. If what we are seeing happen right now in Taiwan, or what happened previously in Hong Kong, will happen in China, we project a lot of mortality, unfortunately, and the surge will overwhelm the hospitals. Many older Chinese people are not vaccinated at the same level as other countries, and also the vaccines used in China are less effective than the vaccines used elsewhere, mRNA vaccines. So we would expect a major surge and a rise in mortality in China. Vaccine and antiviral equity: we are not safe until all of us are safe Based on vaccination rates and our monitoring of people who are willing to take the vaccine, we estimate right now that about 3.1% of people globally who want to get the vaccine and are willing to get the vaccine, have not received it. The majority of them are in Africa. We need to make sure that people who want to get the vaccine are receiving them, who failed distribution, which countries should support poor countries to get the vaccine and vaccinate their population. Again, we're not safe until all of us are safe. The most important thing moving forward right now globally is to ensure that the global distribution, like with vaccination, that global distribution for antivirals is going forward and countries can secure what they need from antiviral in order to provide it to people who are infected, to reduce hospitalization and mortality. Projections in Islamic countries following Eid El-Fitr We are not projecting a rise in cases in the Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean region, WHO region, but we are concerned in many Islamic countries after Eid El-Fitr celebrations with all the mobility, and people are visiting each other and celebrating the holidays. It's possible in some of these countries the decline will slow down and it's possible in some countries that we'll see a small surge in the coming weeks due to the holidays and the celebration. Challenges with data collection At IHME, with our projections, our major challenge in the coming months is the delay in reporting. Many countries and many states have moved to weekly reporting and it's very hard for us to monitor the situation. The fact in the United States that many people are testing themselves at home and not reporting their infections to the local health departments is making it hard for us to follow the epi-curve. We are using admissions to hospitals, COVID-19 admissions, as our main indicator and some places like the United States, where we believe many people are testing themselves at home and not reporting those results to their local health department, we have lowered the infection-detection rate in order to make sure we'll be able to monitor these trends. April 29, 2022 Key takeaways: Omicron will continue to spread in China. After already reaching Beijing, Omicron will likely continue transmission despite the government\u2019s indication that they will keep pursuing the zero-COVID strategy. After already reaching Beijing, Omicron will likely continue transmission despite the government\u2019s indication that they will keep pursuing the zero-COVID strategy. Cases are increasing in Delhi, India, and South Africa. The question remains: are the increases due to new, more transmissible sub-variants, or waning immunity from the previous Omicron wave? The question remains: are the increases due to new, more transmissible sub-variants, or waning immunity from the previous Omicron wave? A concerted policy push is needed to increase access to antivirals. IP waivers have been given to 22 countries by Pfizer, and now a rapid scale-up in production must follow. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity Omicron spreading in China This week from IHME we are not releasing a new set of projections yet. With few exceptions, the epidemic is still continuing to track our forecasts from earlier in the month. The key areas to pay attention to right now are, first and foremost, what's happening in China with the Omicron wave spreading, most importantly to Beijing. Many other cities within China apparently are also under lockdowns or partial lockdowns. As we have been noting for months pre-Olympics, it's really a question of time when Omicron will spread more widely in China, given how transmissible it is, given the comparatively lower efficacy of the vaccines used in China, and particularly this issue that the zero-COVID strategy may not actually work. But our understanding is that the government will pursue that strategy vigorously, at least until the fall. So, no real change in expectations there, but it simply will be a challenging question as to whether that strategy can hold out until the fall. Increasing cases in India The second area of concern that people have been tracking has been the steady uptick in cases in Delhi, India. The question is whether this is due to declining immunity from the prior Omicron wave or the possibility of one of the sub-variants of Omicron fueling transmission in Delhi. They have re-imposed their mask mandate, so we\u2019ll see if that has some effect on that one part of India and the surrounding state of Haryana having some increased transmission. BA.4 and BA.5 variants in South Africa The third area of concern is the uptick in South Africa associated with the BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants, a steady increase but not exponential. The question remains \u2013 is that because these sub-variants are more transmissible, or is it because they have immune escape over BA.1 and BA.2, which were there in South Africa and had become the predominant variants, or is it because of waning immunity, just through time. We are now, for South Africa, pretty much four months, or even four and a half in some provinces, after the peak of the Omicron wave. Access to antivirals The other main consideration globally around managing COVID, particularly in China and for the world, when new variants that are potentially more severe emerge, is access to Paxlovid. We\u2019ve started to finally see some policy discussion around the importance of availability and access to Paxlovid. IP waivers have been given to 22 countries by Pfizer, and the question is, will there be more rapid scale-up in production? We strongly believe that needs a concerted policy push, equivalent to the efforts to expand vaccination. We will certainly expect more from IHME as we run our models in the near future to reflect any new updates in the data as we\u2019ve been describing. Do you have a question about IHME's COVID-19 modeling? We\u2019d love to know what you\u2019re wondering about. Ask a question Due to the sheer volume of questions we receive and our research team\u2019s dedicated efforts in modeling the impact of Omicron around the world, we will only be able to address a limited number of questions. For media inquiries, please contact [email protected]. April 25, 2022 Key takeaways: New modeling suggests antivirals will be key to save lives during future surges. We are investigating the potential impact if a future variant were to be as severe as Delta with the transmission level of Omicron, and have found that antivirals make a profound difference. We are investigating the potential impact if a future variant were to be as severe as Delta with the transmission level of Omicron, and have found that antivirals make a profound difference. Cases are rising in the eastern United States , but deaths are not. Access to antivirals plays a key role in the low death rate. , Access to antivirals plays a key role in the low death rate. Still unknown if lockdowns will prevent an Omicron surge in China. Low vaccination among the 80+ population could result in a huge death toll if an outbreak occurs. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity Lockdowns and Omicron in China This week from IHME, we have not rerun our models. We have been spending time trying to understand the epidemic province by province in China. The key thing there as the outbreak continues to unfold in Shanghai with very broad-based transmission, is now reports of lockdown are confirmed by mobility data in many other cities within China. It remains to be seen whether the zero-COVID strategy will work to keep COVID, or the Omicron variant, from spreading very widely in China. What we do know is that vaccine coverage in the 80+ population in many provinces is quite low. If Omicron spreads widely, there is a real risk that what we saw in Hong Kong could re-occur in mainland China. That's something that we are watching very closely. Currently, our models are assuming that the success that China's had with the zero-COVID strategy controlling Omicron in February, around the time of the Olympics, could be replicated, but we're also hearing reports that the economic costs of this are rising. Cases on the rise in eastern United States For the United States, we're seeing rising case numbers in a number of eastern states. There's some suggestion of rising case numbers in other states as well. There has not been a precipitous rise in case numbers yet \u2013 this increase looks to be related to continued relaxation of behavior, combined with the BA.2 sub-variant. The good news there is we're not seeing an increase in deaths. But it does point out how critical in the US \u2013 and pretty much everywhere \u2013 access to antivirals is going to be. New modeling suggests antivirals will be key to save lives during future surges While there continues to be a lot of discussion about access to vaccines in low- and middle-income countries and even discussion around boosters, there's perhaps not enough focus on making sure that people who need these highly effective antivirals like Paxlovid [can get them] in the future. This is somewhat important right now for the BA.2 sub-variant, but could be extremely important in the future as we imagine that there will be more infectious and potentially more severe variants that emerge during the course of this year. We have started to do some modeling of what would happen if a variant that was as severe as Delta came along with the transmission potential of Omicron, and in that setting, widespread access to an antiviral like Paxlovid really makes a profound difference in saving lives around the world. So a very high priority, both in the US and everywhere in the world, for thinking about health system delivery strategies and access to the drug itself, is that those who can benefit from an antiviral are going to get that antiviral. Expect more from us in the coming weeks as we continue to track the pandemic and try to model out how future scenarios unfold, both with what we know is currently occurring, but also potentially the emergence of new variants. Emergence of new sub-variants The last comment is on the emergence of the BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants in South Africa. They are replacing BA.2 and there is some increase in case numbers, but still modest so far, as distinct from what happened with BA.2. We're now four months or more into the peak of Omicron transmission, so some of that increase in BA.4 and BA.5 could be from waning immunity from what was established through the early Omicron wave in November and December in South Africa. But it\u2019s clearly another facet of the epidemic that will bear close monitoring. April 14, 2022 - Update from Dr. Ali Mokdad Key takeaways: BA.2 surge is ending in Europe. Cases are expected to continue declining in the Northern Hemisphere until next winter. Cases are expected to continue declining in the Northern Hemisphere until next winter. Omicron in China: With only 2% of the population previously infected and 30% immune from vaccination, a large surge is expected if lockdown and strict control measures fail. With only 2% of the population previously infected and 30% immune from vaccination, a large surge is expected if lockdown and strict control measures fail. BA.2 in the US: Some states are seeing a small rise in cases, but high levels of immunity due to previous infection (76%) are preventing a large surge. Some states are seeing a small rise in cases, but high levels of immunity due to previous infection (76%) are preventing a large surge. Mask wearing is below 25% \u2013 the lowest since we began tracking. \u2013 the lowest since we began tracking. Sharing antivirals and vaccines with countries in need is imperative. Policy recommendations: Secure and distribute antiviral medications. Maintain surveillance systems to detect new variants. For those who are immunocompromised or have high risk factors: continue wearing a mask and avoiding large crowds, especially indoors. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity Cases are declining in Europe Globally, we are seeing a decline in reported cases in the majority of countries, and the short surge that has happened after the Omicron surge in some European countries is declining. So we see a decline in reported cases right now in the UK, in Germany, in France. In the long run, we believe that the number of cases will keep declining all the way to next winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Surge predicted in China if precautions fail: only 30% of population currently immune The situation we are monitoring closely right now is what\u2019s happening in China. We believe the strict measures and the lockdown in China have been successful so far in containing the spread of the virus, but with Omicron being extremely contagious and spreading much faster than any previous variant we have encountered, we don\u2019t believe that China could contain the spread of Omicron for a long time. So we\u2019re expecting a rise of infections, reported cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in China if these measures that are in place right now are not successful in containing the spread of the virus. The reason we believe that for China \u2013 if you look at measures that China put in place, they were so effective at preventing infection. Right now in China, about 2% of the public has been infected by COVID-19 since the beginning of COVID-19, compared to 76% of us here in the United States. So we have more immunity than people in China, we have better vaccines with mRNA, and we have a higher vaccination rate, especially among the elderly population. Not for the general population, but for the elderly population in the United States we have a higher vaccination coverage. So when you put all of these together, in the United States we have about 73% of the public that is immune to Omicron, compared to 32% in China. So any outbreak in China, simply because there are about 70% of the public in China that are susceptible to Omicron, we expect a rapid surge of cases, similar to what we are seeing in Hong Kong and in other countries as well. Mobility is increasing, while mask wearing and testing decline More countries are relaxing their mandates right now \u2013 for example, New Zealand and Australia opened their borders to each other and travel is allowed right now. This could have an impact on reported cases as people are traveling and feel they are free to travel right now. Mask wearing is the lowest since we started reporting on mask wearing and since IHME started promoting mask wearing and providing scenarios showing how effective masks are in preventing mortality. So we're at less than 25% right now when it comes to mask wearing \u2013 it varies by countries, but mask wearing has dropped a lot because many countries relaxed their mask mandates, especially in Europe. Testing is declining in many countries: for example, in the UK, they're not paying anymore for testing, so we're seeing a decline in testing. That will impact our ability to track the pandemic in many countries and many locations. Some countries and states have decided to release data on a weekly basis, not on a daily basis, so the quality of data, the timeliness of data has changed, and that will impact our ability to track \u2013 not only us, but other groups who are doing similar projections \u2013 our ability to track the pandemic moving forward. Sharing antivirals and vaccines with countries in need is imperative Globally, there is a need to secure more antiviral medication and make sure it is available to every country to save lives and to prevent overwhelming the hospitals and protect the medical system. In countries where we see a surge of cases, recommending people to wear a mask and observe physical distance will be important. And in many countries in the world, it's very important to encourage the public to receive the vaccines, especially those who are not yet vaccinated and those who are immunocompromised and have health conditions. Our data right now show that a small percentage of people globally who want to get a vaccine or are willing to take the vaccine have not been able to receive the vaccine. The majority are in Africa. Therefore, it's very important to share vaccines with countries where people are willing to take the vaccine and they're waiting to get their vaccine. This is the only way for all of us to save lives and stop the spread of the virus, and of course we're not safe until all of us are safe. In the United States, the BA.2 variant is causing small rise in cases, but no surge expected In the US, we are seeing a slight rise in reported cases in some states, but we don't expect a surge similar to what we have seen in some European countries here in the US, simply because in the United States we have more immunity due to higher rates of previous infections in the country. BA.2 right now is the main circulating variant here in the United States \u2013 about 86% of the variants that are circulating in the US are BA.2. But because of previous infections in the US and our immunity, we don't expect a surge similar to what we have seen in Europe. The extension of the mask mandate on public transportation at the federal level and on airplanes will help a lot, especially right now with spring break vacations and people traveling. Many families are traveling for the first time with their children right now since the start of the pandemic, so one would expect, with the increased mobility and the fact that mask wearing is less than 25% in the US, that we'll see a slight increase in reported cases in the United States. We still believe that the pandemic phase of COVID-19 is over, simply because we have higher infections here in the United States and hence higher immunity. We are improving our vaccine and we soon should be able to have vaccines that are designed for the new variants; the vaccines that we have right now are highly effective, but we need to remember they were designed for the [ancestral] variant. And of course we have antiviral medications that will save lives and prevent hospitalization. If there is a surge from an escape variant, we can always go back to physical distancing and mask mandates and ask the public to wear a high-quality mask and avoid large gatherings. Recommendations for controlling the virus in the US The recommendations in the United States to contain the virus and the epidemic of this virus in the country remain the same: secure antiviral medications, distribute them, make sure patients can access them in a short time to save lives and prevent overwhelming our hospitals; maintain our surveillance system and also our genetic sequencing to know what variants are circulating in the US and, if there is a rise in cases, where it's happening and among whom, especially if they are vaccinated or not, so we can tell as soon as possible if the new variant is an escape variant and the vaccines are not as effective against it. For the public who are immunocompromised or have high risk factors, they need to remain more vigilant and wear a mask, especially if they are in close indoor settings with a large crowd. And all of us, if there is a surge and a new variant that is circulating, we also need to put our masks back on and make sure we maintain a physical and safe distance in order to reduce the chance of getting this virus. In the short term, the coming few months in the United States, IHME is projecting a decline after this tiny little surge, a decline of cases all the way until next winter, short of a new variant appearing. But we are projecting a decline in the number of cases all the way until next winter. April 8, 2022 Key takeaways: New prediction for China: no major Omicron surge. Provinces continue zero-Covid strategy, adhering to strict lockdown measures whenever there is an outbreak. By incorporating lower mobility into our model, we no longer see a massive surge in the forecasts for the coming months.

BA.2 is declining in Europe and is not expected to cause a major surge in the US. Other countries around the world may also avoid a surge due to previous high levels of infection from Omicron. and is not expected to cause a major surge in the US. Other countries around the world may also avoid a surge due to previous high levels of infection from Omicron. Access to antivirals should be the primary focus of global efforts, shifting from previous emphasis on vaccination. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity BA.2 is on the decline in Europe In this week's update from IHME on the COVID-19 pandemic, first, the main findings that we see in the data and in our forecasts are that the BA.2 secondary surge of Omicron that has affected a number of countries in Europe appears to have peaked and is on the decline in almost all locations in Europe. Not all \u2013 there is some question about whether the United Kingdom has peaked and that the decline in cases may be due to access to testing since the tests now have to be paid for. But generally, we are seeing the peak and probably the decline of BA.2 in Europe. We do not expect a major BA.2 surge in the US In the United States, we have yet to see a BA.2 surge. There are some states where we're seeing hospitalization admissions go up slightly but not seeing the reported cases go up. So it may be that there's a small increase coming in some states. Our models for both Europe and the US do not suggest \u2013 at least for the US, we don't expect a major BA.2 surge, and in Europe we expect the surges to peak and decline. New prediction for China: no major Omicron surge The biggest factor in the analysis is the change in our results for China. We had been predicting for quite some time that Omicron would break out into the community and that China would choose to stop using a zero-Covid strategy, or what they call dynamic lockdown. But, given the rather stringent measures put in place in Shanghai, we don't expect, at least until the fall, that the Chinese government is going to step back from its zero-Covid strategy. We've used in the forecasts the observed reduction in mobility based on Baidu data for Shanghai and then assumed that whenever there is an outbreak in each province in China that there will be stringent measures put in place. So we've put substantial brakes on transmission that way through reduction in mobility in our modeling framework. This means that we don't predict a massive surge. We expect that will come later in the year. But we do see quite a number of deaths, given the quite low vaccination rates in the 80+ population in China that have become apparent. We must shift global focus from vaccination access to antivirals The expected trajectory in China does point to a very important role in the current Omicron wave, but more importantly for future new variants as they emerge, in access to antivirals. We see a lot of global discourse about access to vaccination, and that's certainly an important issue in terms of equity \u2013 everybody who wants a vaccine should be able to obtain a vaccine. But in terms of preventing death from future new variants, we think that the scale-up of antivirals, particularly the highly effective Paxlovid \u2013 but if other antivirals come along that are as effective, then those as well \u2013 is going to be the critical issue between a new variant, let's say that's more severe than Omicron, causing considerable mortality versus causing 80-90% less mortality. We will be producing, in the near future, antiviral scale-up scenarios to go alongside vaccination, booster, and mask use scenarios that we routinely produce as part of our periodic assessment of the pandemic. Those are the main findings. Likelihood of BA.2 surge depends on countries\u2019 levels of previous infection In other parts of the world, we're not seeing any evidence of a BA.2 secondary surge, even in places like South Africa where most of the transmission is currently BA.2. This difference across countries may well have to do with population-level immunity, how much prior infection, how much the first Omicron wave infected people. In places where there was a lot of transmission, there's probably enough immunity that we won't see much of a BA.2-related hump. Those are the main observations as we look around the world in our assessment of the pandemic. Do you have a question about IHME's COVID-19 modeling? We\u2019d love to know what you\u2019re wondering about. Ask a question Due to the sheer volume of questions we receive and our research team\u2019s dedicated efforts in modeling the impact of omicron around the world, we will only be able to address a limited number of questions.

The wave was driven largely by the spread of BA.2, changing behavior following the removal of mandates, and waning immunity. The wave was driven largely by the spread of BA.2, changing behavior following the removal of mandates, and waning immunity. We do not expect a BA.2 wave in the US due to high rates of previous infections from Omicron. A surge next winter is still anticipated, and those over 50 years old should get a fourth vaccine dose to protect themselves. due to high rates of previous infections from Omicron. A surge next winter is still anticipated, and those over 50 years old should get a fourth vaccine dose to protect themselves. China continues to keep Omicron at bay , but we predict the surge will come by the end of May. To reduce mortality rates, we recommend: Scaling up production of mRNA vaccines Prioritizing vaccination of the elderly Preparing hospitals by increasing supply of antivirals , but we predict the surge will come by the end of May. To reduce mortality rates, we recommend: Policy recommendation: the US should begin planning for a winter surge including: Securing antiviral medication Planning distribution of antivirals based on risk factors and age Anticipating the potential need for another vaccine dose the US should begin planning for a winter surge including: Vaccine donations are still needed, but only if they have a long shelf life. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity Cases are predicted to decline in the US The reported cases in our estimated infections are decreasing in the United States, and we project this trend will continue all the way to next winter. Our long-term projections for the United States show a rise in cases next winter but a small bump in some states, similar to what we are seeing right now in Europe. But in general in the US, we project a decline that will continue all the way until next winter. What we need to do in the United States is to remain vigilant, of course. COVID-19 is not over; the pandemic phase of it is over. We need to be very careful, especially those who have a risk factor or are immunocompromised. Fourth vaccine dose recommended for those aged 50+ The FDA has approved a fourth dose for people who are above 50. It\u2019s very important for all of us who are above 50, including myself, to go and get number four. It will help a lot in reducing hospitalizations and mortality, especially if you have received your second dose or your third dose more than five months ago. Why is Europe seeing a second wave, and will the same happen in the US? As far as what\u2019s happening in Europe, we know that the second wave in Europe after the peak of Omicron was due to BA.2 spreading, change of behavior, and waning immunity. In the United States, because we have higher infection compared to Europe \u2013 for example, compared to the UK \u2013 we have lower vaccination but more infections. With the combination of the two, we have more immunity in the United States, especially in the Southern states, where they had more infections than we\u2019ve seen in the UK. So we will not expect a big bump in the US. There may be a very minor one in some states, but a decline overall. What the US needs to do is to secure more antiviral medication and keep it and distribute it right now to places ahead of the next surge. And make sure we have a plan for distribution based on risk factors and the aging of the population in each location, but also to have a plan for redistribution in case we have a wave in one state and medication sitting in a warehouse in another state. So, shifting resources is very important for preparedness. We believe that before winter, because of waning immunity, another shot may be needed as well, depending on whether people have received four or three doses. Still, in the US, vaccination is not increasing, and unfortunately we have leveled at about 65% at the national level. Risk of cruises and other activities varies by personal factors CDC has announced that it's ok to get on a cruise ship. I believe it's safe, in my opinion, if you are vaccinated and boosted, and now if you are above 50 and getting the fourth dose. But of course, for all of us, whatever we do from now on has to be based on our own personal risk and the risk of people we live with or we are around. So basically, for somebody who\u2019s young and healthy, the risk is very minimal to get Omicron or BA.2, but for somebody who's older in age, has a risk factor, or is immunocompromised, the risk is much higher. Of course, we have to behave accordingly to protect ourselves and the people we live with and we care about. That's very important. The BA.2 wave is coming to an end in Europe As far as the global landscape, what we are seeing right now in Europe and many countries, the second peak has happened, and it's starting to come down \u2013 in the UK, for example. It\u2019s still going up in France as of today, coming down in the Netherlands, so in many European countries, that second peak lasted about 3-4 weeks and came down. This was driven mainly by BA.2 and the change of behavior. In Europe, they had more mandates than we did here in the United States, and then there was a sudden change of behavior, more so than in some states here in the United States where we didn't have any mandates, Florida for example. So basically, the behavioral change that has happened after the peak of Omicron is minimal in the United States compared to what we've seen in Europe. China continues to keep Omicron at bay China is the country that we are keeping an eye on right now. China so far has been able to contain the spread of Omicron in Beijing by lockdown and massive testing. Whether they will be able to do so and maintain that control in Shanghai and other large cities is a big question mark. BA.2 and Omicron are more infectious, so we believe the chances of containing the spread of Omicron in China will be very limited. Our long-term projections in China show that they will have a major surge coming up with a peak in May, towards the end of May, with a large number of hospitalizations and mortality, for several reasons. China has a high vaccination rate, but their vaccine is not as effective as the vaccines we are using here in the United States or in European countries. So what China needs to do is \u2013 and we know they have right now received the permit to produce mRNA vaccines from Pfizer, and they have their own mRNA vaccine being developed right now \u2013 so producing more vaccines and vaccinating people, especially the elderly in China, because we know there are reports that vaccination among the elderly is very low compared to what we have seen in other countries. Second, is to produce more antivirals, and we know that they have right now licenses to produce antiviral medication and distribute it in China. Preparing their hospitals for the surge is very important right now. Vaccine donations are still appreciated, but only if they have a long shelf life Vaccine donations have saved a lot of lives all over the world, and countries have been generous in providing extra doses of vaccines to others who need it. It's very important to remember as you donate these vaccines to make sure they have a long shelf life. They shouldn't be about to expire. Once you give a vaccine to a country, there are a lot of logistics and distributions and manpower that's needed to administer these vaccines. Indonesia, for example, has asked all donors, please when you give us a vaccine let's make sure it has a long shelf life. We need to keep that in mind and not waste vaccines. Thank you everybody for donating the vaccine, but let's make sure the vaccine can be used by the country that is receiving them in time before they expire. March 21, 2022 Key takeaways: Four zones of Covid transmission in the world Majority of countries: transmission continues to decline Western Europe: secondary increase in transmission from BA.2 Southeast Asia: peak Omicron wave China: not yet experienced an Omicron wave, but we anticipate it will arrive in the next few months, causing up to a million deaths BA.2: Countries that have already dealt with BA.2 transmission (Netherlands, Denmark) saw brief surges that ended reasonably quickly. That pattern may spread to the rest of Western Europe and North America. Increased transmission is likely due to a combination of BA.2 and reduced mask use and social distancing. Ukraine: there will likely be increased transmission due to the ongoing war and crowded conditions, but the impact may be reduced because of high levels of prior immunity in the population. Policy recommendation: We should shift focus away from vaccination and towards production and distribution of anti-virals like Paxlovid. Can reduce death rate by 90% More likely to maintain effectiveness against new variants that may come in the future This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity In this week\u2019s update from IHME on the COVID-19 pandemic, the first thing to recognize is that there are really four zones of Covid transmission right now in the world. In the vast majority of countries, transmission continues to decline, as countries come off the peaks of Omicron transmission. Western Europe is experiencing a second wave in transmission from BA.2 As there has been quite a bit of media attention, there is a secondary increase in transmission in some countries in Western Europe, most notably the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, and Greece, are places where transmission is on the increase. That increase is being attributed to the substitution of the BA.2 variant for the BA.1 variant, combined with reduced mask use and social distancing. We don't think it's just BA.2, because BA.2 has actually been around for quite some time. In fact, for example in South Africa, it appeared in December. It's replaced BA.1 but there's been no substantial increase in community level transmission. We don't think \u2013 and you see this in our forecasts \u2013 that this combination of BA.2 and reduced caution about transmission will lead to a prolonged secondary surge. The reason is the surge in the Netherlands \u2013 it went up, then came back up, and now the secondary surge has already peaked and is on its way down. In Denmark, the BA.1 and BA.2 parts sort of coalesced into one and that also came to an end reasonably quickly. We think that will be the pattern that we'll see in other countries in Western Europe, and it's possible that pattern will spread to the United States and Canada as well. Southeast Asia is in peak Omicron wave The third zone are those countries still in the main upswing, or peak levels of transmission due to a delayed Omicron wave. Those are mostly in Southeast Asia \u2013 Vietnam and Cambodia are good examples of that. And then the biggest driver of transmission, cases, and potentially deaths, is what's playing out in the zero-Covid strategy countries, so New Zealand looks to have hit their peak on Omicron, but it's coming down quite slowly. China has not yet seen an Omicron wave And then the big, big question is China. Because we've seen in an immunologically naive population with not good vaccination coverage in the elderly, quite a toll in Hong Kong. And now the question is when and if that will spread to mainland China. There are outbreaks in multiple cities, including Shanghai and Shenzhen and a number of other locations. The Chinese government is still pursuing the strategy of lockdown for a short period and then multiple rounds of mass testing to identify all cases and then quarantine them. This worked in Beijing in February to stop transmission and they are trying to pursue this for now, but the economic consequences are very great and there's greater calls within the Chinese leadership for less of a stringent policy. We predict next wave in China could be devastating Our model foresees that that can't go on for that long and so we have a huge peak, with perhaps as many as a million deaths in China coming through in April, May, and into June. The timing of that will depend critically on how the Chinese government chooses to either relax or not their zero-Covid strategy. The other key issue that could mitigate the huge death toll that could be coming in China is the recent announcement of an IP waiver from Pfizer for Paxlovid for producers in 22 countries, including five producers in China. So there's an interesting strategic choice that will play out, which is that the balance of the economic harm of the aggressive zero-Covid strategy and creating time to produce anti-virals that would be sufficient to protect some of the unvaccinated elderly within China. The timing and how that plays out is going to be up to the policy choices in China. The importance of anti-virals If we step back and zoom out more globally, there's still a tremendous amount of energy in trying to address vaccine inequality and addressing supply constraints, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa around vaccination. That's certainly well-justified on moral grounds \u2013 everybody should have access to vaccination who wants it \u2013 but may not have a huge effect on death and hospitalization. We see in the data in sub-Saharan Africa and other low-income countries, that cumulative infection rates are quite high \u2013 80-90% of most countries have already been infected, they have immunity from infection, and also vaccine hesitancy is quite high. So even if the supply constraints are addressed \u2013 which they should be, on moral grounds \u2013 we should not expect that to make a huge effect on this 6-month timeframe of hospitalizations and death rates. However, what we don't see is similar international energy on the crucial issue of access to anti-virals, because anti-virals like Paxlovid can reduce the death rate by 90% and production capacity is small. With the new IP waivers going to India and China and some other countries, perhaps we can have a more concerted global effort in giving access to everybody who needs it, particularly the elderly, to anti-virals. That could really change the course of Covid over the next 12 months. The other aspect of the anti-virals scale-up that is important to recognize is that we don't really know if current vaccines will do much for future variants. Vaccine effectiveness against Omicron, particularly transmission, has been quite low with current vaccines. Whereas we suspect that the pathway that the anti-virals use will stay pr",

        "text":"Using information from ESA\u2019s Swarm satellite mission, scientists have discovered a completely new type of magnetic wave that sweeps across the outermost part of Earth\u2019s outer core every seven years and propagates westward at up to 1 500 km (932 miles) a year. The discovery offers a way to probe the cylindrical radial component of the magnetic field inside Earth\u2019s core. Since the trio of Swarm satellites was launched in 2013, scientists have been analyzing their data to gain new insight into many of Earth\u2019s natural processes, from space weather to the physics and dynamics of Earth\u2019s stormy heart. Measuring our magnetic field from space is the only real way of probing deep down to Earth\u2019s core. Seismology and mineral physics provide information about the material properties of the core, but they do not shed any light on the dynamo-generating motion of the liquid outer core. But now, using data from the Swarm mission, scientists have unearthed a hidden secret. \u201cGeophysicists have long theorized over the existence of such waves, but they were thought to take place over much longer time scales than our research has shown,\u201d said lead author Nicolas Gillet from the University Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes. \u201cMeasurements of the magnetic field from instruments based on the surface of Earth suggested that there was some kind of wave action, but we needed the global coverage offered by measurements from space to reveal what is actually going on. \u201cWe combined satellite measurements from Swarm, and also from the earlier German Champ mission and Danish \u00d8rsted mission, with a computer model of the geodynamo to explain what the ground-based data had thrown up \u2013 and this led to our discovery.\u201d Owing to Earth\u2019s rotation, these waves align in columns along the axis of rotation. The motion and magnetic field changes associated with these waves are strongest near the equatorial region of the core. While the research exhibits magneto-Coriolis waves near a seven-year period, the question of the existence of such waves that would oscillate at different periods, however, remains. \u201cMagnetic waves are likely to be triggered by disturbances deep within the Earth\u2019s fluid core, possibly related to buoyancy plumes. Each wave is specified by its period and typical length-scale, and the period depends on characteristics of the forces at play. For magneto-Coriolis waves, the period is indicative of the intensity of the magnetic field within the core,\u201d Gillet added. \u201cOur research suggests that other such waves are likely to exist, probably with longer periods \u2013 but their discovery relies on more research.\u201d \u201cThis current research is certainly going to improve the scientific model of the magnetic field within Earth\u2019s outer core. It may also give us new insight into the electrical conductivity of the lowermost part of the mantle and also of Earth\u2019s thermal history,\u201d said Ilias Daras, ESA\u2019s Swarm mission scientist.

The front stretches from the Tibetan Plateau to Japan along a confluent jet stream that separates Arctic circulation to the north from tropical circulation to the south. Along this boundary, mesoscale convective complexes (MCCs) or mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) tend to form and propagate eastward, giving a series of heavy downpours.2 References: 1 Tornado kills 1 in eastern China as country faces high temps \u2013 AP \u2013 July 21, 2022 2 Mei-yu front \u2013 AMS \u2013 Accessed July 20, 2022 Featured image credit: Eric Wang",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.verywellhealth.com\/when-can-i-get-my-second-booster-shot-6374064",
        "text":"Key Takeaways Bivalent COVID boosters are expected to have wide eligibility and be recommended for everyone. The Biden administration has already secured more than 170 million doses of updated vaccine candidates from Pfizer and Moderna. Rollout will begin after Labor Day. Since the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended the inclusion of Omicron BA.4\/BA.5 components for reformulated COVID-19 booster shots, the Biden administration has been busy securing enough vaccine doses for deployment in September. Early reports from The New York Times indicate updated boosters will be available to all Americans 12 and older shortly after Labor Day. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Defense has secured millions of doses of this new, variant-specific style of booster, referred to as a \"bivalent\" vaccine. Specifically, the government has 105 million doses of a Pfizer bivalent booster and 66 million doses of a Moderna bivalent booster. As of this week, both companies have submitted their updated booster candidates to the FDA for emergency use authorization. Pfizer's bivalent booster is intended for ages 12 and up, while Moderna's is only for adults. The bivalent booster will work against the original COVID-19 virus, plus the Omicron family, including the spike protein for BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. Since bivalent COVID-19 boosters expected to roll out soon, it's unlikely the FDA and CDC will expand who is eligible for the existing, regular booster. Right now, only select individuals meet the criteria for a second booster: Adults aged 50 years and older Individuals aged 12 or older who are moderately or severe immunocompromised Recipients of two doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine Here\u2019s what you need to know if you\u2019re waiting to get your second booster shot. Bivalent Boosters May Have a Wider Eligibility While the final say on who will qualify for bivalent boosters is up to the CDC, they\u2019ll likely be widely available. \u201cI believe we will have a general recommendation for everyone\u2014all ages\u2014to have the bivalent booster this fall,\u201d David J. Cennimo, MD, FACP, FAAP, an associate professor of medicine and pediatrics in the division of infectious diseases at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, told VeryWell. \u201cI do not think the booster will be limited to ages above 50 and immunocompromised.\u201d Based on the current guidelines, these bivalent boosters may be recommended at least five months after the previous vaccine dose, whether it\u2019s from the primary series or an earlier booster dose, he added. \u201cIn my work, we are already making plans to role out this type of booster at the same time we are offering yearly influenza vaccine,\u201d Cennimo said. \u201cWe believe the CDC will let us give them together.\u201d Why Boosters Matter Booster shots have been available to all adults since November of 2021. That means that except for the 50+ crowd or immunocompromised folks who've been able to get second boosters, many Americans haven't received bolstered COVID protection in nine months. It\u2019s important to widen the eligibility of booster shots so that more individuals can enhance their fading protection. Some research shows booster protection against Omicron wanes three months after the shot. \u201cWith new COVID-19 cases still at around 130,000 a day and with well over 400 deaths a day, we need to continue doing everything possible to decrease the spread of this virus,\u201d Mark Loafman, MD, MPH, a family physician and chair of the Family and Community Medicine Department at Cook County Health in Chicago, told Verywell. \u201cFor the foreseeable future, that means boosters for all.\u201d Rolling out new interventions such as the bivalent vaccines usually starts with a triage process to prioritize the first available doses to those who will benefit the most, but the goal will almost certainly be to get everyone boosted, he added. Should You Delay Your Booster Shot? The general public may expect the bivalent vaccines to be available beginning in September. \u201cThe U.S. has contracted for about 170 million doses, with proposals in the works for as many as 600 million,\u201d Loafman said. \u201cWith numbers like that, we should be able to get a dose to everyone who is willing by late fall or early winter.\u201d Those who are eligible for a second booster shot now may be wondering if it\u2019s better to get it now or wait for the impending bivalent booster. Experts said this is a difficult situation, but ultimately, it\u2019s better to get the second booster now if you are already eligible. The decision depends on an individual\u2019s risks of serious illness with COVID-19, exposure risks, and timing of any travel, Loafman said. Cennimo hopes pending federal guidance will allow anyone who recently received an original booster to additionally get a bivalent booster as soon as it's available. \u201cI hope the recommendation will allow us to truncate the five months wait between doses, because I do think the bivalent booster will be better,\u201d he said. What This Means For You If you are eligible for a second booster now, don't delay and get boosted already to improve your protection against the Omicron variant. Otherwise, start gearing up for a September shot. The information in this article is current as of the date listed, which means newer information may be available when you read this.

        "text":"Cosmos checks out the data, stories and new research into COVID-19 emerging around the world. What\u2019s the data today? Globally, there are 600,555,262 confirmed cases and 6,472,914 confirmed deaths from COVID-19. In Australia, over 95% of eligible Australians have received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. More than 70% of people over 16 have received a booster, and over 39% of eligible people have received a fourth dose. There are 111,081 estimated active cases in Australia (decreasing). Of these, 2,937 (decreasing) are hospitalised, 84 (decreasing) are in ICU and 24 (decreasing) are currently ventilated. There have been over 10 million cases of COVID-19 in Australia, and 13,902 deaths. Data. COVID-19 cases and deaths per million people COVID news in brief Requiring a negative RAT is better for the community While Australia has cut the required isolation period to five days (from seven previously), pre-print research from the University of Auckland may suggest requiring a negative rapid antigen test to leave isolation has better community benefits. While the research is yet to be peer-reviewed, it does suggest a test-to-release requirement alongside minimum isolation lengths could reduce the number of infectious people released into the community by 40%. \u201cRapid Antigen Tests are the best tool we have to tell if people are still infectious, so it is possible to tailor an isolation period to when people are infectious. Some people could leave isolation sooner than seven days, some people will need to isolate for longer,\u201d says researcher Dr Emily Harvey. \u201cWhen RATs are positive, you are likely infectious, because we now know that false positives are vanishingly unlikely.\u201d Study in kids to help guide best-practice vaccination in under 18s A new national study will seek to determine an optimal strategy for vaccinating people under 18 years. $3.8 million has been given to Perth\u2019s Telethon Kids Institute from the commonwealth Medical Research Future Fund and will investigate what vaccine combinations provide the best protection for children, among other study areas. \u201cWe are also hoping this research will reveal if a past COVID-19 infection provides a similar level of natural immunity against the virus as vaccination, or if an annual booster will be required for kids, just like the flu vaccine,\u201d says study lead Dr Charlie McLeod. COVID-19 has greater impacts on child mortality, parent death in low-income countries Separate studies have highlighted the disproportionate COVID-19 burden borne by lower income nations. In one carried out by US-based Global Financing Facility for Women, Children, and Adolescents, the pandemic-related child death and maternal mortality was associated with declining use of essential health services. The research led by Dr Tashrik Ahmed suggests the pandemic has reversed years of positive social and health games for women and children. \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has reversed years of progress in the health of women and children, especially those in the most vulnerable communities,\u201d says Dr. Ahmed. Get an update of science stories delivered straight to your inbox. Get a daily dose of science Get a weekly Cosmos Catch-up Meanwhile research from Australian National University has found children are more likely to be orphaned by COVID-19 in low-income nations. While estimates suggest up to 1,900 young people in Australia have lost at least one parent during the pandemic, the rate is much higher in parts of continents like Africa. Angola, for instance, has seen more than two hundred children lose a parent per 100 deaths. Australia\u2019s comparison is 13 per 100. \u201cWe think of COVID-19 as a disease that largely affects older people, but we have forgotten about the young people and children that are left behind,\u201d says lead researcher Callum Lowe. \u201cCOVID-19 has spread to almost every country on the globe but there continue to be huge disparities about the effect on different countries.\u201d Denmark: Third mRNA vaccine is more effective against Omicron infection Research from the Danish Statens Serum Institut has found a third dosage of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is more effective against Omicron subvariant infections. The study reviewed Danes aged 12 and above, to determine a third vaccine dose was nearly 60% better at preventing Omicron infection, compared to just under 40% effectiveness from two doses. A third dose is necessary to maintain protection against infection for a longer time and to ensure a high level of protection against COVID-19 hospitalization with the Omicron variant,\u201d says study lead Mie Agermose Gram. \u201cDespite being less effective against infection with Omicron than previous variants, a third mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose offers better protection against Omicron infection than two doses and protects well against COVID-19 hospitalisation.\u201d Longer reads CSIRO says workforce development is key to pandemic preparation Australia\u2019s peak scientific research body has pointed to a range of areas that could benefit from investment if the country is to successfully prepare prepare for the next pandemic and avoid the $144 billion economic hit and thousands of lives lost during COVID-19. Story by Olivia Henry Australia trims COVID-19 isolation period Assuming a person is symptom free, they will now be able to exit isolation five days after a positive test for COVID-19, following a decision made by Australia\u2019s national cabinet.

        "title":"Promising new data on COVID pill",
        "link":"https:\/\/cosmosmagazine.com\/health\/covid\/covid-treatment-pill-paxlovid-molnupiravir\/",
        "text":"This week, Pfizer published data from a new study suggesting its oral COVID treatment pill (nirmatrelvir, brand name Paxlovid) reduces the risk of severe disease by 89%, according to the company\u2019s phase 2-3 trial. Australia\u2019s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) provisionally approved the pill for use in here in January, and the Australian Government has already secured access to 500,000 treatment courses of Paxlovid for supply in 2022. A total of 2,246 patients were involved in the double-blind, randomised controlled trial, with 1,120 receiving the pill and 1,126 receiving a placebo. There are all sorts of other medicines being used to treat COVID-19, including the injectible Remdesivir, the only antiviral drug approved to treat moderate-to-severe COVID in adults who aren\u2019t on ventilation. But the promise of an oral COVID pill is its ease; it\u2019s quick, simple, and can \u2013 at least physically \u2013 be administered by almost anyone. It could be a key frontline solution, especially for vulnerable people in remote areas or those who can\u2019t be moved to larger hospitals. \u201cThere are some specific cases that highlight how important they can be,\u201d says Paul Griffin, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Queensland. \u201cMost importantly aged-care settings where it can be hard to get those people to hospital for intravenous therapies. \u201cBeing able to give them something that reduces their chances of progressing to severe disease and hospitalisation is going to really change things in my opinion.\u201d So, how do COVID treatment pills actually work? According to the TGA, the nirmatrelvir component of the Paxlovid pill blocks the activity of a protease enzyme that coronavirus needs in order to replicate. Nirmatrelvir is combined with a low-dose of ritonavir, which maintains plasma levels of the nirmatrelvir for the duration of treatment. And Paxlovid isn\u2019t the only oral COVID treatment coming to \u2013 or already on \u2013 the market. The TGA approved another oral pill, Molnupiravir (brand name Lagevrio), at the same time as Paxlovid. The pill, which was originally developed by Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics to treat influenza, works similarly to inhibit replication of the virus. Preliminary results from October last year suggested the pill reduced the risk of hospitalisation or death by approximately 50% compared with placebo. \u201cMolnupiravir works in another way that sounds really cool,\u201d says Griffin. \u201cIt causes lots of errors in reproduction \u2026 it causes viral error catastrophe, so the progeny are non-viable and that stops it being able to reproduce.\u201d The drugs are part of a new world-order in treating COVID; now we have tools we can use easily and widely to both prevent and treat the disease. Get an update of science stories delivered straight to your inbox. Get a daily dose of science Get a weekly Cosmos Catch-up When will they roll out, and who will get access to these COVID-busting pills? As reported by the RACGP earlier this month, the pills are unlikely to be widely available in the immediate term. New clinical guidelines for use in Australia specify they should be used in the early stages of the virus in unvaccinated adults who are at higher risk of serious disease progression. That\u2019s because the trials did not include people who had received two vaccine doses, so their efficacy is less clear for vaccinated patients. The Department of Health has stated that the pills should be reserved primarily for use among the most at-risk groups, including in residential aged care facilities and Aboriginal community-controlled health services. Griffin says there\u2019s not yet clarity on how exactly the rollout will work: \u201cWe\u2019re hearing that aged care facilities have actually been delivered some of these products, but they\u2019re not clear on who\u2019s going to prescribe them, and there\u2019s a bit of a gap at this stage in terms of exactly who\u2019s best suited to receive these agents.\u201d In fact, the pills aren\u2019t on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) yet, so there are still a number of steps to be finalised. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to do is come up with a complicated system that requires input from hospital specialists to approve it in the community, when the whole idea is that it\u2019s community-focused and can be administered rapidly,\u201d Griffin says. \u201cSo, I think we need to address some of these logistical challenges quite quickly.\u201d Most importantly, these pills aren\u2019t meant to be preventative, or a vaccine substitute \u2013 they should be administered within five days of the onset of symptoms, with the goal of preventing the disease from progressing further. \u201cThey\u2019re not a replacement for vaccination,\u201d Griffin says. \u201cThey\u2019re very much a supplementary tool in people who still go on to get infected and are high risk and need additional help to reduce their chance of progressing to severe disease. \u201cIn no way do they reduce the importance of vaccinations.\u201d",

        "text":"ABOVE: \u00a9 ISTOCK.COM, LUZA STUDIOS Update (September 2): The CDC greenlighted the use of the Moderna and Pfizer Omicron boosters yesterday, meaning that the shots could start being administered within days. People must have had their most recent COVID-19 jab at least two months previously\u2014a cutoff that several members of a panel of expert advisers to the CDC suggested was too short, according to The New York Times. Update (September 1): The European Medicines Agency today has recommended the authorization of both the Pfizer and Moderna Omicron booster shots, which it says in a statement can both be used in people aged 12 years old and up. Meanwhile, Health Canada has approved the Moderna booster shot in people aged 18 and over. Two sorts of booster shots designed to protect people against the latest Omicron subvariants of SARS-CoV-2 received emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration today (August 31), the agency has announced. The formulations, which target both the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and the highly infectious BA.4 and BA.5 lineages of the Omicron variant, can only be administered to people who have completed their primary two-dose vaccination. One, developed by Pfizer\/ BioNTech, has been authorized for people aged 12 years old and up, while the other, developed by Moderna, has been OK\u2019d for people aged 18 or older. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has \u201cbeen planning for the possibility that the composition of the COVID-19 vaccines would need to be modified to address circulating variants,\u201d Peter Marks, director of the agency\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, says in the announcement. He adds: \u201cWe have worked closely with the vaccine manufacturers to ensure the development of these updated boosters was done safely and efficiently.\u201d The creation of Omicron-targeting vaccines emerged as a priority for the FDA earlier this year as data and expert opinion pointed to the benefits of this approach as opposed to a fourth dose of the original COVID-19 vaccines. Speaking about the choice for healthy people between getting an Omicron booster or a fourth dose of the original vaccine, University of South Carolina School of Medicine Columbia\u2019s Prakash Nagarkatti told The Scientist earlier this month: \u201cClearly the data show that the bivalent vaccines which incorporate the Omicron variant provide stronger and better protection against the Omicron variants. . . . Thus, it is clearly better to get vaccinated with such newer vaccines than the original vaccines because Omicron is the primary strain that is spreading.\u201d The new bivalent shots contain mRNA coding for the spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2 variant and that of the latest Omicron lineages, although the companies differ in exactly how much of each they use. On its website, Moderna describes its shot as a \u201c50 \u00b5g booster dose . . . 25 \u00b5g of mRNA encoding for the spike protein of BA.4\/.5 and 25 \u00b5g encoding for the original strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\u201d Pfizer\u2019s formulation instead \u201ccombines 15-\u00b5g of mRNA encoding the wild-type spike protein . . . and 15-\u00b5g of mRNA encoding the spike protein of the OmicronBA.4\/BA.5 subvariants.\u201d The FDA made its decision without requiring that the companies submit additional human data on the modified vaccines, employing a procedure the agency already uses to authorize other sorts of vaccines, such as flu shots, that undergo minor modifications from year to year. The FDA instead reviewed data that Pfizer and Moderna had collected from clinical studies of the safety and efficacy of earlier iterations of the shot, which had been targeted at the original Omicron subvariants circulating last winter, the Associated Press reports. In addition, the agency examined the results of animal tests with the new, BA.4- and BA.5-targeting boosters, which showed the formulations triggered \u201ca very good immune response,\u201d Marks tells the AP. Full approval for the boosters will require human data\u2014something that the companies plan to collect in clinical trials starting next month, Science reports. The outlet also reports that some researchers express concern that the lack of human data at this point could undermine public acceptance of the vaccines. The Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) will now issue its own recommendation about who should receive the boosters. The agency has scheduled a vote among its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for this Thursday, according to NBC.",

        "text":"ABOVE: \u00a9 ISTOCK.COM, dlmck Australia\u2019s largest-ever philanthropic donation for medical research will fund a new center dedicated to laying the groundwork for developing therapies to fight future pandemics, the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity announced today (August 31). The new Cumming Global Centre for Pandemic Therapeutics (CGCPT) will be part of the Doherty Institute, which is a joint venture of the University of Melbourne and the Royal Melbourne Hospital. The newly announced center is named for Geoffrey Cumming, a businessman who lives in Melbourne and, according to Science, made his fortune in energy. He is contributing 250 million Australian dollars (US$172 million) to the center, while the state of Victoria is chipping in AU$75 million (US$51 million). Cumming, who was born in Canada and holds Canadian and New Zealand citizenship, has made donations to medical research before, notes The Guardian, including a CA$100 million contribution to the University of Calgary in 2014. His desire to now prioritize therapies stems from his observations earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic, when \u201cWhat struck me was how quickly we could make vaccines, and how slow we were with antivirals,\u201d Cumming tells Science. \u201cFar too little has been invested in therapeutics,\u201d Bruce Walker, an immunologist and infectious disease researcher at Harvard Medical School, tells Nature. \u201cMost other efforts are focused on the development of vaccines, but vaccines are not always the solution,\u201d he says\u2014for example, no vaccine is yet available for HIV, but it is now a treatable condition thanks to therapeutics. The CGCPT will be part of the Australian Institute for Infectious Disease, which is set to launch in 2027, according to a Doherty Institute fact sheet. The CGCPT will focus on developing new platform technologies that can be used to rapidly develop or adapt drugs to target novel pathogens. \u201cOur objective is to be a globally top pandemic therapeutic research centre,\u201d Cumming says in the Doherty Institute\u2019s announcement. \u201cWe aim to create solutions to minimize the impact of future pandemics and thereby create greater societal resiliency internationally in the decades ahead.\u201d",

Furthermore, harnessing the advanced innovations that comprise much of the synthetic biology realm is critical to deciphering the inter-workings of this highly adaptable virus. In this GEN webinar, our distinguished speaker, Dr. Silvi Rouskin, will focus much of her presentation on the biology of coronaviruses and how synthetic biology enables the study of coronavirus gene expression and recombination. This groundbreaking research ultimately aims to lead to a greater understanding of these processes while expediting the design of novel therapeutics and helping to prepare for future pandemics. Join us to learn more about synthetic biology applications for nested genomes, frameshifting, discontinuous transcription, recombination in coronaviruses, and how an automated platform can optimize their build. A live Q&A followed the presentation, offering a chance to pose questions to our expert panelist.",

        "title":"Omicron Vaccine Boosters Receive FDA Emergency Use Authorization",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.genengnews.com\/virology\/coronavirus\/omicron-vaccine-boosters-receive-fda-emergency-use-authorization\/",
        "text":"Headlines about COVID-19 vaccine boosters have slowed. However, the possibility of omicron-targeting boosters rolling out this week has reignited the booster buzz. Yesterday, the FDA granted emergency use authorizations (EUAs) of both the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to authorize new formulas. The bivalent formula, or \u201cupdated boosters,\u201d will now contain two mRNA components of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The first is the original strain of SARS-CoV-2. The second is common between the BA.4 and BA.5 lineages of the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. The goal is to provide better protection against COVID-19 caused by the omicron variant. The BA.4 and BA.5 lineages of the omicron variant are currently causing most cases of COVID-19 in the United States and are predicted to circulate this fall and winter. In June, the agency\u2019s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee voted overwhelmingly to include an omicron component in COVID-19 booster vaccines. \u201cThe COVID-19 vaccines, including boosters, continue to save countless lives and prevent the most serious outcomes (hospitalization and death) of COVID-19,\u201d said Robert M. Califf, MD, FDA Commissioner, \u201cAs we head into fall and begin to spend more time indoors, we strongly encourage anyone who is eligible to consider receiving a booster dose with a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine to provide better protection against currently circulating variants.\u201d For each bivalent COVID-19 vaccine, the FDA based its decision on the totality of available evidence, including extensive safety and effectiveness data for each of the monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, safety and immunogenicity data obtained from a clinical study of a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine that contained mRNA from omicron variant BA.1 lineage that is similar to each of the vaccines being authorized, and nonclinical data obtained using a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine that contained mRNA of the original strain and mRNA in common between the BA.4 and BA.5 lineages of the omicron variant. The updated Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is authorized for use as a single booster dose in individuals 18 years of age and older. The updated Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is authorized for use as a single booster dose in individuals 12 years of age and older. Also, given the new formulations, the monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are not authorized as booster doses for individuals 12 years of age and older. Who is eligible to receive the new boosters? Anyone 18 or older is eligible for a single booster dose of the updated Moderna COVID-19 vaccine if it has been at least two months since they have completed primary vaccination or have received the most recent booster dose with any authorized or approved monovalent COVID-19 vaccine. People 12 years of age and older are eligible for a single booster dose of the updated Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine if it has been at least two months since they have completed primary vaccination or have received the most recent booster dose with any authorized or approved monovalent COVID-19 vaccine. Pfizer-BioNTech notes that an omicron-adapted bivalent vaccine for children 5 through 11 years of age is planned for submission to the FDA in early October and the companies are working with the FDA to prepare an application for an Omicron-adapted bivalent vaccine in children 6 months through 4 years of age. \u201cThe FDA has been planning for the possibility that the composition of the COVID-19 vaccines would need to be modified to address circulating variants. We sought input from our outside experts on the inclusion of an omicron component in COVID-19 boosters to provide better protection against COVID-19. We have worked closely with the vaccine manufacturers to ensure the development of these updated boosters was done safely and efficiently. The FDA has extensive experience with strain changes for annual influenza vaccines. We are confident in the evidence supporting these authorizations,\u201d said Peter Marks, MD, PhD, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. \u201cThe public can be assured that a great deal of care has been taken by the FDA to ensure that these bivalent COVID-19 vaccines meet our rigorous safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality standards for emergency use authorization.\u201d",

StockWatch appears weekly in GEN Edge. Subscribe today to GEN Edge, starting with our 30-Day Free Trial, and keep a leading edge on the competition. Shares of Novavax (NVAX) hit a 52-week low on Wednesday, falling 6% to $33.04, then sinking even lower in Thursday pre-market trading, dipping another 1% to $32.82 (as of 9:04 a.m.). The bad stock news came as the FDA expanded its emergency use authorizations (EUA) of the Pfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines to include bivalent formulations for use as single \u201cupdated\u201d boosters at least two months following primary or booster vaccination. Moderna\u2019s booster or COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent, also known as mRNA-1273.222, targets Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, and is authorized for use in adults 18 years of age and older. The 50 \u00b5g booster dose of mRNA-1273.222 consists of 25 \u00b5g of mRNA encoding for the spike protein of BA.4\/.5 and 25 \u00b5g encoding for the original strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent, is authorized for people 12 years of age and older. The vaccine combines 15-\u00b5g of mRNA encoding the wild-type spike -protein of SARS-CoV-2 present in the original Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and 15-\u00b5g of mRNA encoding the spike protein of the Omicron BA.4\/BA.5 subvariants. The expanded authorizations came two weeks after Novavax submitted to the FDA its application for an EUA for its own booster dose for adults ages 18 and older. The expanded EUAs will likely expand the gap in doses administered between Novavax and three more established COVID-19 vaccine rivals\u2014not only Pfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna, but also Johnson & Johnson (J&J), whose single shot jab is a recombinant vector vaccine that uses a human adenovirus to express the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in cells. As of August 31, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\u2019s COVID-19 Data Tracker, only 14,559 doses of Novavax\u2019s vaccine had been administered nationwide, compared with 18,866,547 for J&J, 229,236,868 for Moderna, and 360,175,884 for Pfizer\/BioNTech. The CDC also recorded just 2,591 Americans as being fully vaccinated by Novavax\u2019s vaccine, compared with 17,080,700 with J&J\u2019s jab, 77,824,706 with Moderna\u2019s, and 128,817,297 with the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine. Doses of Novavax\u2019s vaccine have been available for use in the U.S. since July, compared with February 2021 for J&J and December 2020 for the Pfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. On Sunday, Jefferies analyst Roger Song, MD, CFA, shared figures from his firm\u2019s own COVID-19 vaccine global supply\/demand weekly tracker that portends better news for Novavax, both now and the rest of this year. Jefferies\u2019 tracker showed 1.21 million doses of Novavax\u2019s vaccine having been administered year to date, and about 108 million doses of Novavax\u2019s vaccine having been delivered. \u201cWe see a path to achieve [Novavax\u2019s] updated revenue guidance of $2-2.3B in 2022,\u201d Song wrote. [That guidance was slashed in August from between $4 billion and $5 billion, which triggered a one-day 30% decline in Novavax\u2019s share price August 9.] How well Novavax follows that path to fulfilling its revenue guidance will depend on several factors cited by Song that could affect near term demand. They include: Orders and advance purchase agreement updates, quarter-on-quarter sales, worldwide ancestral\/Omicron-containing booster approvals expected in the second half of this year, full U.S. approval expected later this year, a possible Omicron bivalent booster approval, as well as new variants\/cases, duration of immunity\/severe disease protection and variant specific\/multi-valent\/combo vaccine. As for Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna, the FDA EUAs did not do much for the companies\u2019 stock. Following the FDA EUAs on Wednesday, Pfizer shares dipped 1%, from $45.85 to $45.23. BioNTech shares slid about 2%, from $147.08 to $144.64, while Moderna sank nearly 3% $135.93 to $132.27. \u201cThe continued development of Omicron-specific boosters alone highlights the mRNA vaccine platform\u2019s speed and flexibility. However, the uptake of these new boosters, expected to be rolled out in fall\/winter, is predicted to mirror the poor uptake patterns of other recent boosters,\u201d said Emily Martyn, MPH, Pharma Analyst at GlobalData. \u201cNew ideas are urgently needed to encourage as many people as possible to accept the fall\/winter boosters, or we risk reinfection and the possibility of yet more variants.\u201d Chimerix (CMRX) Chimerix shares spiked 23% on Monday, from $2.16 to $2.6499, before ending trading with an 8% gain after announcing it had signed an up-to-$680 million, 10-year contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) for the delivery of up to 1.7 million treatment courses of tablet and suspension formulations of Tembexa\u00ae (brincidofovir) to the U.S. government. The contract (5A50122C00047) includes an initial product procurement of 319,000 treatment courses for approximately $115 million. In addition to product procurement, the contract supports post-marketing activities of approximately $13 million. In addition to the BARDA contract, Chimerix stands to make millions from selling its worldwide rights for Tembexa to Emergent BioSolutions (EBS). Back in May when that contract was announced, Chimerix was expected to receive $225 million upfront and up to $100 million in milestone payments. But the EBS contract was subject to revision after the BARDA contract was finalized. Under the revised EBS agreement, Chimerix stands to gain $238 million upfront, up to $124 million in milestones, a 15% royalty on gross profit from sales of Tembexa outside the U.S.; a 20% royalty on gross profit from sales of Tembexa in the U.S. that exceed 1.7 million treatment courses; and up to an additional $12.5 million tied to achieving additional developmental milestones. \u201cOur collaboration with BARDA for the development of Tembexa has provided the United States government with a second therapeutic option to ensure the federal government\u2019s readiness for a potential smallpox emergency,\u201d Chimerix CEO Mike Sherman said in a statement. [The first is Siga Technologies\u2019 Tpoxx\u00ae (tecovirimat), which made headlines earlier this year when the federal government allowed the drug to be used as a monkeypox treatment under an expanded access program.] Jounce Therapeutics (JNCE) Jounce shares fell 16% on Tuesday, from $4.29 to $3.61, after acknowledging that the combination of its lead candidates\u2014vopratelimab (vopra), an inducible costimulator (ICOS) agonist, plus the PD-1 inhibitor pimivalimab (pimi; formerly JTX-4014)\u2014missed their primary endpoint in the Phase II SELECT trial (NCT04549025), designed to evaluate the combination vs. pimi alone in immunotherapy na\u00efve, TISvopra biomarker-selected, second line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The trial tested two pulsatile and differentiated doses of vopra in the combination groups against pimi monotherapy, using as the primary endpoint the mean percent change from baseline in tumor size in all measurable lesions, averaged over nine and 18 weeks as assessed by central independent radiology review. While the study was powered to detect a 20% absolute difference of the pooled combo doses compared to pimi alone, the actual difference was just 7%, Jounce said. However, the combination dose cohort with the lowest dose of vopra (0.03mg\/kg) showed an absolute mean change of 15%. In prespecified secondary endpoints, that combo showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 40% compared to 25% in pimi alone\u2014as well as landmark six-month progression free survival (PFS) of 80% vs. 33% for pimi alone. \u201cAlthough we are intrigued by the preliminary efficacy trends, particularly the landmark PFS and ORR in the lower vopra dose combination arm, the SELECT results do not support moving into registration studies as had been our previous goal,\u201d Jounce CEO and president Richard Murray, PhD, said in a statement. \u201cWe will re-evaluate the vopra program in the context of our broader pipeline in the coming months.\u201d Liquidia (LQDA) Liquidia shares spiked 43% on Wednesday, from $5.38 to $7.71 at 2:36 pm before finishing the day with a 7% gain, to $5.77, after a mixed set of rulings in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware in a longstanding patent infringement case filed by United Therapeutics (UTHR). United Therapeutics has alleged that Liquidia\u2019s proposed treprostinil inhalation powder, YutrepiaTM would infringe on patents it holds that include No. 9,593,066 (Process to Prepare Treprostinil, the Active Ingredient in Remodulin\u00ae), and No. 10,716,793 (Treprostinil Administration by Inhalation). U.S. District Court Judge Richard Andrews ruled that Yutrepia would infringe five of six claims of the \u2019066 patent, but found those claims to be invalid, adding that the only valid claim was not infringed by Liquidia. The \u2018066 patent protects a method of making treprostinil, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in both Tyvaso\u00ae (treprostinil) Inhalation Solution and Tyvaso DPI\u2122 (treprostinil) Inhalation Powder. However, Andrews also that Liquidia would induce infringement of the five asserted claims in the \u2018793 patent\u2014siding with United Therapeutics, which lost a recent Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) decision holding that all claims in the \u2018793 patent were unpatentable. United Therapeutics has requested rehearing regarding the PTAB decision, which came in an inter partes review of the \u2019793 patent initiated by Liquidia. If the PTAB does not reverse itself, United Therapeutics said Wednesday, it will appeal the board\u2019s decision. The company noted that the \u2019793 patent remains valid during the pendency of all appeals\u2014and predicted that any IPR appeal process will likely take at least a year. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased with the Court\u2019s decision on the \u2019793 patent, and our legal team is evaluating options for the \u2019066 patent,\u201d said Shaun Snader, Vice President and Associate General Counsel\u2014IP and Litigation at United Therapeutics, said in a statement. Added Liquidia CEO Roger Jeffs in his company\u2019s statement: \u201cWhile we are disappointed with the Court\u2019s decision on the \u2018793 patent, we are optimistic that the PTAB\u2019s favorable decision will be affirmed on appeal, thereby unlocking the path to potential approval of Yutrepia by mid-2024, if not earlier.\u201d Shuttle Pharmaceuticals (SHPH) Who said the IPO market is dead? Shuttle shares nearly quintupled on Wednesday, zooming 374% from the initial public offering (IPO) price of $8.125 per \u201cunit\u201d [consisting of a share of common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of common stock], with 1,225,888 units offered, for total gross proceeds of $9,960,340. But in a sign that the market isn\u2019t yet back from the decline that started last year, Shuttle Pharma\u2019s proceeds are down from the $14.3 million projected when it first planned a larger IPO back in June. Boustead Securities acted as lead underwriter for the IPO, with Valuable Capital serving as co-underwriter. Shuttle Pharma investors received better news on Thursday, when the company\u2019s shares nearly tripled at the opening bell, spiking 176% to $106.20 before settling to $59.64 as of 1:20 p.m., a 55% gain. Investors appeared dazzled by the company\u2019s claim in its IPO Prospectus that its novel therapies \u201care designed to cure cancer.\u201d Shuttle Pharma was founded in 2012 by faculty members of the Georgetown University Medical Center, with the aim of developing therapies that maximize the effectiveness of radiation therapy while limiting the side effects of radiation in cancer treatment. The Rockville, MD, company\u2019s pipeline includes lead candidate Ropidoxuridine, which has completed a Phase I trial and is designed to work by sensitizing rapidly growing cancer cells. Also in the pipeline are several selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, also designed to sensitize cancer cells as well as stimulate the immune system. \u201cOur platform of sensitizers are designed to address an urgent clinical need in patients with brain tumors, sarcomas and pancreatic cancers, all diseases that offer potential for orphan designations,\u201d Shuttle Pharma\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Anatoly Dritschilo, MD, said in a statement. In its IPO Prospectus, Shuttle Pharma acknowledged it will need to raise much more than it received through the IPO. \u201cWe believe we will need approximately $22 million in additional funding to complete Phase III clinical trials for Ropidoxuridine and approximately $30 million in additional funding to complete Phase I through III clinical trials for our selective HDAC6 inhibitor,\u201d Shuttle Pharma disclosed. \u201cIf such additional funds are required, we will have to secure additional funding from investors or through a joint development partner.\u201d",

        "text":"Editor\u2019s note: For the latest news on COVID-19, visit http:\/\/bit.ly\/AAPNewsCOVID19. Adolescents and adults can start receiving a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine booster dose designed to protect again the omicron variant. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director signed off on the updated boosters from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech Thursday after they were recommended in a 13-1 vote by the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). \u201cThe updated COVID-19 boosters are formulated to better protect against the most recently circulating COVID-19 variant,\u201d CDC Director Rochelle P. Walensky, M.D., M.P.H., said in a press release. \u201cThey can help restore protection that has waned since previous vaccination and were designed to provide broader protection against newer variants. This recommendation followed a comprehensive scientific evaluation and robust scientific discussion.\u201d The bivalent vaccine boosters contain both the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 and the omicron BA.4\/5 variant. About 89% of circulating strains are BA.5, and nearly all the rest are BA.4, according to the CDC. Officials have been preparing for a possible surge this fall and winter as people spend more time indoors. The Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent booster can be used for people ages 12 and older, while the Moderna bivalent booster can be used for those ages 18 and older. A bivalent booster can be given as a single dose at least two months after a primary series or booster with any authorized monovalent COVID-19 vaccine. About 209 million people in the U.S. are eligible for the bivalent boosters, including 14 million adolescents ages 12-17 years, according to the CDC. The government has purchased about 171 million bivalent booster doses. Safety and immunogenicity Trials in adults found bivalent boosters with the BA.1 strain from both manufacturers increase the immune response of people who have previously received the primary series and monovalent booster doses. Compared to the original boosters, the bivalent boosters produce a superior immune response to the omicron variant without compromising the response to the original strain. Reactogenicity after the bivalent boosters was similar to the primary series and original boosters. While the risk of myocarditis after a bivalent booster is unknown, the risk after monovalent boosters is lower than after the second dose of the primary series, according to data from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System. While more than 1,400 people received a bivalent vaccine with omicron in trials, it did not include the BA.4\/5 strain used in the updated vaccines. Several ACIP members expressed concerns about only animal studies being available for BA.4\/5, including Pablo J. Sanchez, M.D., FAAP, a neonatologist and pediatric infectious diseases specialist at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. He cast the lone \u201cno\u201d vote. \u201cIt's a new vaccine, a new platform, there\u2019s a lot of vaccine hesitancy already,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need the human data. At the same time, I think the vaccine will have similar safety as we\u2019ve already seen with the previous (mRNA) vaccines.\u201d ACIP COVID-19 Vaccines Work Group Chair Matthew F. Daley, M.D., FAAP, senior investigator at the Institute for Health Research at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, said he also struggled with the lack of BA.4\/5 specific data but pointed to CDC modeling that found giving boosters to adults starting in September could prevent 137,000 more hospitalizations and 9,700 more deaths compared to waiting until November. \u201cI find it quite reassuring that the immune response in general to the bivalent vaccines really does seem more diverse and I\u2019m hopeful it will protect against additional variants,\u201d he said. Other members also said they were reassured by more than 600 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines having been given in the U.S. and robust safety monitoring. ACIP Executive Secretary Melinda Wharton, M.D., M.P.H., said changing vaccine strains without a clinical trial happens every year with the flu vaccine. The CDC also said differences between the BA.1 strain in the clinical trials and the BA.4\/5 strain in the updated booster are subtle. Trials with the BA.4\/5 strain are ongoing. Doran Fink, M.D., M.P.H., deputy director of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Division of Vaccines and Related Products Applications, addressed concerns about trials including only adults. While there may be some differences in reactogenicity or immune response in younger groups, he said, the trends across age groups with the original formulations generally have been similar. Clinical considerations Moderna bivalent boosters will be a 50-microgram dose, while Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent boosters will be a 30-microgram dose, the same antigen amounts as the monovalent vaccines. The boosters can be given as a single dose at least two months after vaccination with a primary series or monovalent booster. A booster can be a different brand from previous doses as long as it is age appropriate. People can get the bivalent booster regardless of how many previous boosters they have had. People who are immunocompromised are similarly recommended to get a bivalent booster at least two months after their three-dose Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech primary series or two-dose Novavax primary series regardless of previous monovalent boosters. People recovering from a COVID-19 infection should not get a booster until they have recovered and met isolation criteria, according to the CDC. Then they can consider waiting three months before getting the booster. The CDC encourages co-administration of the bivalent COVID booster with other routine vaccines, including the flu vaccine, to keep people up to date on all recommended immunizations. Co-administration has been found to be safe and immunogenic, although the CDC recommends using a different injection site and in some cases different limbs if possible. The exception on co-administration is the JYNNEOS monkeypox vaccine. The CDC recommends people consider waiting four weeks after JYNNEOS before receiving an mRNA COVID vaccine, especially adolescent or young adult males who may be at increased risk of myocarditis. The Moderna booster will have a dark blue cap and gray label border, while Pfizer-BioNTech will have a gray cap and label border. The vials have similar color patterns as some of the COVID vaccine vials already in use, sparking concern from ACIP members. \u201cThis is why I've been so worried about labeling issue because it\u2019s impairing our ability to actually deliver vaccines without fear of causing any adverse events,\u201d said ACIP Chair Grace M. Lee, M.D., M.P.H., associate chief medical officer for practice innovation at Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital in California. Monovalent boosters no longer are authorized for use in age groups for which a bivalent booster is available. However, monovalent vaccines still are authorized for use as a primary series in people 6 months and older. The monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine also can continue to be used as a single booster for children ages 5-11 years at least five months after a Pfizer-BioNTech primary series. There are unique Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for each dose of each vaccine product, including for new bivalent booster vaccines. A full listing can be found at COVID-19 Vaccine Administration: Getting Paid. With new vaccine products, such as the bivalent booster vaccines, there may be a delay in CPT codes being valued and loaded into payer systems. As a result, practices might consider confirming that payers have updated their payment systems prior to submitting claims. Manufacturers plan to submit bivalent booster data for younger children later this fall. Resources",

        "text":"State-level reports are the best publicly available and timely data on child COVID-19 cases in the United States. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children\u2019s Hospital Association are collaborating to collect and share all publicly available data from states on child COVID-19 cases. The definition of \u201cchild\u201d case is based on varying age ranges reported across states (see report Appendix for details and links to all data sources). As of March 2, almost 15.5 million children are reported to have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic according to available state reports. Over 106,000 of these cases have been added in the past 4 weeks. This week nearly 19,000 child COVID-19 cases were reported. Over the past 5 months, weekly reported child cases have plateaued at an average of about 32,000 cases. The age distribution of reported COVID-19 cases was provided on the health department websites of reporting states, New York City, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam. Since the pandemic began, children represented 18.0% of total cumulated cases. For the current week ending March 2, the portion of reported cases that were children was 11.3% (children, under age 18, make up 22.2% of the US population). Reported cases are likely a substantial undercount of COVID-19 cases among children. There is a need to collect more age-specific data to assess the severity of illness related to new variants as well as potential longer-term effects. It is important to recognize there are immediate effects of the pandemic on children\u2019s health, but importantly we need to identify and address the long-lasting impacts on the physical, mental, and social well-being of this generation of children and youth.",

        "title":"Here, we cover 12 persistent myths surrounding IBD. Among other topics, we will discuss treatment, stress, personality, and symptoms beyond the gut.",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/medical-myths-all-about-ibd",
        "text":"Share on Pinterest Design by Andrew Nguyen IBD is a condition that affects the gastrointestinal system. The symptoms often include abdominal cramps, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea. The symptoms can fluctuate and may last for days, weeks, or months at a time. In 2015, an estimated 3 million people in the United States had IBD. Globally, the disease affected an estimated 6.8 million people in 2017. The most common forms of IBD are Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. Both involve chronic inflammation of the digestive tract. Despite the relatively high prevalence of IBD, a great deal of misinformation and misunderstanding surrounds it. Here, we fight fiction with facts. To aid us on our quest, we have enlisted the help of Dr. Abhik Bhattacharya, assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Gastroenterology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, NY. 1. IBD is the same as IBS IBD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) both affect the digestive system and have similar acronyms. This, perhaps, explains some of the confusion. However, the two conditions are not the same. Dr. Bhattacharya explained to Medical News Today that IBS \u201cis a disorder of the interaction between the gut and brain, leading to diarrhea, constipation, or both, along with bloating and pain. [It] can be worsened or precipitated by stress and anxiety.\u201d Conversely, he continued, IBD \u201cis a disease of a dysregulated immune system, wherein the immune system starts attacking your own gastrointestinal system, leading to damage.\u201d \u201cThe disease can lead to stress, worsening anxiety, depression, and loss of sleep because of the devastating consequences it can have on a person\u2019s daily functioning,\u201d he said. \u201cSymptoms can include bleeding in stools, diarrhea, severe belly pain, unintentional weight loss, fevers, chills, rectal pain, fatigue, and more.\u201d 2. Stress causes IBD IBD is driven by the immune system, so stress is not the direct cause. However, as Dr. Bhattacharya explained, it \u201ccan make life very stressful.\u201d Stress can trigger IBD flares and exacerbate the symptoms in some people, which might help explain the confusion. However, stress does not cause IBD. 4. Some people have both Crohn\u2019s and ulcerative colitis Crohn\u2019s and ulcerative colitis are the most common forms of IBD. However, they are distinct conditions, and people cannot have both. \u201cYou can either have Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis,\u201d said Dr. Bhattacharya. \u201cHowever, in a very small subset of patients, it is hard to determine whether they have Crohn\u2019s or ulcerative colitis. The disease, however, does reveal itself over the course of a patient\u2019s lifetime.\u201d 5. No treatments can relieve IBD Thankfully, this is untrue. \u201cThere are many treatments that are extremely effective for IBD. Depending on what you have and how severe the disease is, we have a plethora of options for medical treatment,\u201d explained Dr. Bhattacharya. He then outlined some of the available interventions: \u201cThese include, but are not limited to, biologic medications, such as Remicade [infliximab], Humira [adalimumab], Cimzia [certolizumab pegol], Simponi [golimumab], Entyvio [vedolizumab], and Stelara [ustekinumab], or small molecules like Zeposia [ozanimod] and Xeljanz [tofacitinib]. These are potent immunosuppressant medications, and we are constantly developing new medications through clinical trials.\u201d 6. Everyone with IBD needs surgery \u201cNo, everyone does not need surgery,\u201d Dr. Bhattacharya told MNT. He explained that in the past, a majority of people with IBD would have undergone surgery. However, \u201cwith the advent of very effective and safe immunosuppressant medications,\u201d rates of surgery have dropped significantly over the past 20 years. According to Crohn\u2019s & Colitis UK, about 15% of people with ulcerative colitis will need surgery 10 years after diagnosis. However, in agreement with Dr. Bhattacharya, the organization notes that the improved treatments available mean that this percentage is reducing. \u201cThe goal of treatment,\u201d Dr. Bhattacharya said, \u201cis to prevent surgery due to complications of bowel damage.\u201d He advocates for early treatment with potent medications soon after diagnosis. This, he explained, prevents damage, thereby removing the need for surgery. 7. People should not take IBD medications during pregnancy This is not true. \u201cMost IBD medications are very safe during pregnancy,\u201d said Dr. Bhattacharya. He explained that the goal is to keep people with IBD in remission during pregnancy \u201cbecause the worst thing to happen for both baby and mother is for the disease to be active.\u201d \u201cWe have gathered, and continue to gather, a large amount of data regarding the safety of medications during pregnancy.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Bhattacharya There is an important exception, though: methotrexate. Dr. Bhattacharya told us that methotrexate \u201cis stopped even when women with IBD are planning to get pregnant.\u201d 8. If your symptoms go, you can stop medication Once drugs for IBD take effect and the symptoms disappear, it can be tempting to stop taking the medication. However, this is not what doctors recommend. Dr. Bhattacharya told MNT: \u201cAt this moment, we don\u2019t have a good way of stopping medications for patients with IBD in remission. [\u2026] We don\u2019t recommend stopping medications.\u201d He explained that ending treatment can have serious consequences. For instance, the symptoms might come back, and if the person restarts on the same treatments, these may not work. \u201cWhile we do have options when it comes to treatment,\u201d he said, \u201cthose options are not limitless, and we don\u2019t want to run through medications. There is good data to support that when [\u2026] one set of IBD medications [fails], your response to another type may be less likely.\u201d 9. A gluten-free diet cures IBD As Dr. Bhattacharya told MNT, a \u201cgluten-free diet works for [people with] celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity,\u201d but it will not benefit those with IBD. 10. IBD only affects the gut Although, as the name suggests, IBD significantly affects the bowel, the disease can also have ramifications on many other parts of the body. \u201cApart from the gastrointestinal system, which includes the mouth to the anus, IBD can have extraintestinal manifestations like affecting the skin, eyes, and joints, to name a few,\u201d said Dr. Bhattacharya. According to a review of extraintestinal manifestations of IBD, they \u201ccan involve nearly any organ system [\u2026] and can cause a significant challenge to physicians managing IBD patients.\u201d For instance, IBD can affect the musculoskeletal system, as well as the eyes, kidneys, and lungs. It may also damage the hepatopancreatobiliary system, which includes the pancreas, liver, gallbladder, and bile duct. 11. IBD is curable At this time, there is no cure for IBD. However, as Dr. Bhattacharya said, \u201cthis is a work in progress.\u201d Researchers are working tirelessly to understand the condition better so that they can design better treatments and, perhaps one day, a cure.",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/covid-19-decision-fatigue-expert-tips-on-how-to-cope",
        "text":"Share on Pinterest What is decision fatigue, and how has this phenomenon evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic? Kayla Snell\/Stocksy. New Normal Health All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic. Decision fatigue happens when, after making many decisions at once, a person\u2019s ability to make decisions declines. Complex decisions, such as those posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, deplete one\u2019s capacity for decision making especially quickly. According to a survey by the American Psychological Association published in October 2021, 32% of adults in the United States struggled to make basic decisions, such as what to wear, due to COVID-19-induced stress. Different age groups reported experiencing the phenomenon at different rates: 48% of millennials 37% of Generation Z 32% of Generation X 14% of baby boomers 3% of older adults These findings correspond with the survey\u2019s findings on stress levels. Younger groups were significantly more likely to report high stress levels than older groups. Parents with children under 18 years old were also disproportionately affected by stress compared with those without children. While 47% of these parents reported that day-to-day decisions were more stressful than before the pandemic, the same was true for 30% of those without children under 18 years old. People of Color have also been more affected by pandemic-related stress. According to the study, 38% of Hispanic adults and 36% of Black adults reported that pandemic-related stress impacted their decision making, compared with 29% of non-Hispanic White adults. How the concept came to be Decision fatigue happens when a person becomes fatigued or exhausted from making too many decisions. It affects a person\u2019s ability to make further decisions, whether simple, such as deciding what to eat for dinner, or complex, such as determining whether or not to change jobs. The concept of decision fatigue originated in 1998. It centers on the idea that humans have a limited capacity to regulate their behavior. This means that after a certain point, people simply run out of energy to make decisions, much like a car running out of fuel once its petrol tank is empty. Running out of \u201cdecision making fuel\u201d is also known as ego depletion. Ego depletion changes the way we focus on and process information to make decisions, as well as our motivations. These motivational shifts can make a person more likely to make impulsive decisions that, under normal circumstances, they would not make. \u201cDoing repeated decision making [that] involves trade-offs between multiple competing values, such as risks and benefits\u201d increases a person\u2019s risk of experiencing decision fatigue, Dr. Gustav Tingh\u00f6g, an associate professor at Linkoping University in Sweden, told Medical News Today. \u201cCareful consideration of pros and cons in decision making is mentally taxing and may lead to decision fatigue when we feel stressed and mentally overloaded. This can lead people to shy away from engaging in cognitively demanding reasoning when tired and instead turn to decision\u2010making heuristics, that is, mental shortcuts that allow us to make decisions on the basis of simple rules of thumb without engaging in cognitively demanding reasoning.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Gustav Tingh\u00f6g But decision fatigue does not just happen from making decisions. It can happen from any activity that demands the exertion of self-control. Dr. Grant A. Pignatiello, an instructor and clinical research scholar at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, told MNT that \u201c[d]ecision fatigue can manifest after repeated or effortful attempts of self-control.\u201d \u201cThe most common example is from making decisions. But it can also result from controlling your emotions, doing things that require cognitive effort, or intense physical exertion,\u201d he noted. Susceptibility Several factors are associated with a higher risk of decision fatigue, including: chronic exposure to stress and work complexity to stress and work complexity low knowledge and experience of independent decision making and a lack of direct managerial supervision and a lack of direct managerial supervision a high workload a lack of time to make decisions Dr. Pignatiello said that everyone is susceptible to decision fatigue. However, the exact causes will differ from person to person: \u201cIt\u2019s important to know that the circumstances that lead to decision fatigue are unique for every person \u2014 for example, two individuals doing the same thing may experience different levels of decision fatigue. For a literal example, running a 5K may deplete your tank more than it would a person who runs every day.\u201d He added that the demands of modern everyday life, alongside modern work environments, necessitate complicated decisions that may make some more susceptible to decision fatigue than others. How to spot decision fatigue Signs of decision fatigue include brain fog, feeling tired, and other signs of physical or mental fatigue. These may intensify the more decisions a person makes throughout the day. When asked how people may be able to spot whether or not they are experiencing decision fatigue, Dr. Tingh\u00f6g said, \u201cIf there are drifts in the type of decision you are making throughout the day, without there being a logical explanation, this could be due to decision fatigue.\u201d \u201cBut also, it is possible to identify decision fatigue through introspection,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen we feel that we don\u2019t have enough mental energy to make a thorough deliberation before an important decision, we are suffering from decision fatigue.\u201d Dr. Pignatiello also noted: \u201cIt requires some self-awareness for us to know when we may be in a state of decision fatigue. Some common signs include struggling with decisions that otherwise would not require much thought, e.g., \u2018What do I eat for dinner?\u2019 \u2018What should I wear?\u2019, feeling overwhelmed by our emotions, having a harder time remembering things or focusing, or simply just feeling more \u2018drained\u2019 than normal.\u201d",

        "text":"Share on Pinterest After 2 years of COVID-19, what does mental health look like, worldwide? Image credit: Boy_Anupong\/Getty Images. New Normal Health All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2020, the United Nations reported that stress and anxiety levels had risen substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, several waves of COVID-19 have left their mark around the globe. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines mental health as \u201ca state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.\u201d Mental health issues occur when people cannot cope well with the stresses of life. A pandemic is a stressor that few might have envisaged having to cope with. Fear and isolation The fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, together with concern about economic effects, has caused anxiety and stress. Frontline workers, particularly medical professionals, have experienced burnout and chronic stress from the increased pressure. Multiple lockdowns, physical distancing, and fear of infection have increased isolation, loneliness, and anxiety, all factors that, according to Lee Chambers, psychologist and founder of Essentialise Workplace Wellbeing, are \u201cmassive catalysts\u201d for mental health issues. Other experts agree. According to Dr. Adrian James, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists: \u201cSocial isolation, loneliness, stress and anxiety, domestic abuse, bereavement, financial difficulties, unemployment and severe COVID-19 infection are all factors that might have caused people\u2019s mental health to deteriorate.\u201d Worldwide increases in mental health issues In 2019, a study in The Lancet reported that some 12.5% of the global population would have an issue with their mental health at some time in their life. In March 2022, the WHO reported that worldwide, anxiety and depression increased by 25% in the first year of the pandemic. Lee Chambers has seen evidence of this: \u201cIf I\u2019m honest, from my perspective, the incidence of everything [mental health-related] has increased. [\u2026] It has been amplified for people who are already suffering with certain conditions. They\u2019ve found less access to services and challenges in managing their everyday existence.\u201c He added: \u201cOne thing that continually got flagged was new incidences. People who had never previously identified as having any mental health condition had actually disclosed [\u2026] or, in surveys, said they were struggling significantly. That is interesting, as it shows the impact is reaching beyond those who were already impacted pre-[COVID-19].\u201d Early impact The beginning of the pandemic appears to have had the greatest impact on mental health. A report from the European Parliament Research Service highlighted increases in mental health concerns in many European countries at this time. Eight out of 10 people in Italy reported a need for psychological care; in the Netherlands, over a third of the population reported anxiety. Similar patterns became evident in the United States. In a study of people aged 18-35, 80% of survey respondents reported significant depressive symptoms, while 61% reported moderate or severe anxiety. In April 2021, the National Institute of Mental Health reported that rates for anxiety, depression, stress-related symptoms, substance misuse , and suicidal thoughts were almost double those expected before the pandemic. However, concerns that suicide rates might rise appear to have been unfounded as, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , these have fallen slightly. In the United Kingdom, mental health referrals to the National Health Service (NHS) have reached record levels, as Dr. James told MNT: \u201cThe pandemic has had a major impact on already stretched specialist mental health services, which received a record 4.3 million referrals during 2021. It\u2019s also resulted in the largest mental health backlog in NHS history with at least 1.4 million people waiting for treatment.\u201d Who is most affected? An analysis of more than 200,000 people in northern Europe found that younger respondents and those with previously diagnosed mental illness reported poorer mental health during the first months of the pandemic. However, mental health issues are not confined to these groups. Sharon Greene, L.C.S.W., who specializes in treating anxiety and depression in children and adolescents of Providence Saint John\u2019s Child & Family Development Center in Santa Monica, CA, told MNT of the pandemic\u2019s widespread impact: \u201cI actually feel everyone has been impacted across the board in different ways. Of course, frontline workers and health professionals were at the forefront and may have experienced more trauma. We are only starting to understand the mental health impacts of the pandemic.\u201d Young people may be less at risk to contract a SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they have not escaped the pandemic\u2019s effects. Disruption to education, work, and social interactions have all taken their toll. In August 2020, the International Labour Organization described the \u201cimpact of the pandemic on young people to be systematic, deep and disproportionate.\u201c Several studies have found that students have experienced higher levels of symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the pandemic. \u201cYounger people [\u2026] are more likely to fall into negative coping mechanisms because they don\u2019t have the experience and they live in a very digital world \u2014 that\u2019s a challenge for them. Dealing with uncertainty when you are at that adolescent-adult transition is hard enough when everything is bright and rosy.\u201d \u2013 Lee Chambers It is unsurprising, therefore, that a recent OECD report states that the \u201c[p]revalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression has risen dramatically among young people and remains higher than pre\u2011crisis levels.\u201d On the frontline For medical professionals, the pressures have been intense. Not only have they faced continued exposure to SARS-CoV-2, but they have also had to cope with the demands of their changing roles during the pandemic, which has inevitably taken a toll on their mental health. A meta-analysis of studies into mental health effects of the pandemic on healthcare workers found that anxiety, depression, and stress were most prevalent among this cohort. Many healthcare workers also reported burnout, insomnia, fear of infection, and suicidal thoughts. It is not just those dealing with COVID-19 patients in a hospital setting who have been affected. A global review of studies published in the British Journal of General Practice found high levels of work-related stress, anxiety, and burnout among primary care doctors in many countries. Lee Chambers reported another issue among medical professionals: \u201cThere is a real feeling of\u2026 I suppose the term for it is \u2018moral injury,\u2019 a real feeling that you are putting yourself at risk of disease. You are on the front lines really making the best of a crisis and then you\u2019ve got certain people in positions of influence just doing as they please, having parties. [\u2026] That\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s really distressing a lot of medical professionals.\u201d The worrying impact of this is that many doctors may leave the profession. The British Medical Association found in a recent survey that 21% of respondents were considering leaving the NHS, and 25% were considering taking a career break because of the stress of working through the pandemic. In the survey, one GP expressed what may well be the views of many, noting that, \u201c[i]f things don\u2019t change in the next few weeks, I do worry that many colleagues will leave the profession, not because they have failed, but [because] the Government and the system failed them.\u201d Taking care of mental health Nevertheless, there are ways to help protect mental health through these challenging times. According to Lee Chambers, communication is key: \u201cI look at resilience as expressive rather than suppressive, an ability to express yourself rather than trying to be robust and resist. Endurance generally leads to burnout [\u2026] Being able to talk and articulate and find someone you trust to express where you are currently at.\u201d He added: \u201cResilience is like a battery. The main ways to recharge it are the fundamentals \u2014 sleeping, nutrition, movement. For me, it\u2019s trying to build those into your life.\u201d People should not be afraid to seek help and to recognize the warning signs that they may need help. \u201cIs it pervasive? Is it prolonged? And, is it something that is increasingly spiraling out of our control. At that point, we need to look to see how we can access professional services.\u201d \u2013 Lee Chambers Dr. James echoed this advice, noting that \u201c[p]eople who are struggling with their mental health can talk to their [primary care doctor] or self-refer directly to a local psychological therapy service.\u201d",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/fda-authorizes-updated-covid-19-boosters-targeting-omicron-variants",
        "text":"Share on Pinterest Dinendra Haria\/SOPA Images\/LightRocket via Getty Images On August 31, the FDA authorized updated \u201cbivalent\u201d COVID-19 boosters for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. Bivalent boosters offer better protection against COVID-19 variants, including the dominant Omicron variants, which are predicted to circulate this fall and winter. Moderna and Pfizer\u2019s bivalent boosters will replace the current monovalent boosters for eligible individuals \u2014 Moderna is available to people ages 18 and Pfizer for 12 and up. On Wednesday, August 31, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) appended its emergency use authorizations to include bivalent formulations of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines. The FDA authorized the bivalent formulations of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines to be used as a single booster dose at least two months following a primary or booster vaccination. \u201cThe FDA has been planning for the possibility that the composition of the COVID-19 vaccines would need to be modified to address circulating variants, said Dr. Peter Marks, Ph.D., director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in a news release . \u201cWe have worked closely with the vaccine manufacturers to ensure the development of these updated boosters was done safely and efficiently.\u201d The bivalent formulation of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is authorized as a single booster for individuals 18 years and older. Meanwhile, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine can be used as a booster dose in individuals 12 and up. \u201cWe are confident in the evidence supporting these authorizations,\u201d Dr. Marks continued. \u201cThe public can be assured that a great deal of care has been taken by the FDA to ensure that these bivalent COVID-19 vaccines meet our rigorous safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality standards for emergency use authorization.\u201d Bivalent vaccines and COVID-19 variants Bivalent vaccines, which stimulate an immune response against two different antigens in a single inoculation, contain two messenger RNA (mRNA) components of the SARS-CoV-2 virus: one includes the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, and the other is similar to the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron variants. Experts have been calling for the development of multivalent vaccines or \u201cupdated boosters\u201d since they provide better protection against several SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron. The current dominant BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron variants are expected to circulate this fall and winter. \u201cAs we head into fall and begin to spend more time indoors, we strongly encourage anyone eligible to consider receiving a booster dose with a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine to provide better protection against currently circulating variants,\u201d said FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert M. Califf in a news release. Who should get a bivalent booster shot? Infectious disease specialist Dr. Monica Gandhi, MPH, professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, told Medical News Today that the updated booster can increase antibodies in humans to the circulating dominant subvariant, which she says is mostly BA.5. Despite the potential for effectiveness against the subvariants, Dr. Gandhi noted that evidence in humans is still lacking. \u201cTo be fair, we need to note that we only have data in mice of increased antibodies at this point,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do not have human data on this new booster, either antibody or clinical data. However, there is biological plausibility that these updated boosters will curb cases by increasing antibodies as we enter the winter.\u201d Still, Dr. Gandhi pointed out some recent data that can help clarify how we use these boosters and for whom they\u2019re most appropriate. Monovalent boosters still offer protection Individuals who\u2019ve received a monovalent booster shot are still protected from developing severe illness from COVID-19. A recent paper published earlier this month in JAMA shows a strong protective effect of a single booster against severe illness from Omicron subvariants BA.1 and BA.2 that continues to demonstrate the powerful cellular immunity (T and B cells) triggered by the vaccines. Not all individuals require a second booster Dr. Gandhi cited another recent paper in JAMA , which shows that a single booster with an mRNA vaccine provides additional protection for at least 6 months. This means that a second COVID-19 booster \u2014 or fourth dose \u2014 should not be required for all older individuals at this time. Older adults, the immunocompromised may need it most \u201cGiven all of the data showing strong protection of the previous mRNA vaccines against severe disease, I would recommend this Omicron specific booster for older people who benefit from an \u201cantibody boost\u201d during times of high viral circulation,\u201d Dr. Gandhi said. \u201cThis is because B cells typically take 2\u20134 days to make neutralizing antibodies, which may be too long to wait for those who are more susceptible to severe disease.\u201d \u201cI would recommend this booster shot for those who are immunocompromised or those who are 60 years and above, and preferably in those whose last shot was more than 6 months ago. I also see no harm in younger people getting this Omicron-specific booster \u2014 but given that confusing messaging on boosting may have led to a lower booster uptake among older individuals in the U.S., I would definitely encourage this booster most for those 60 years of age and older.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Monica Gandhi, MPH, infectious disease specialist and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco",

        "text":"New Normal Health All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic. Share on Pinterest Research shows that people were more creative during the first COVID-19 lockdown. Lisa Schaetzle\/Getty Images The American Psychological Association defines \u201ccreativity\u201d as \u201cthe ability to produce or develop original work, theories, techniques, or thoughts.\u201d While this obviously applies to artistry, it can apply equally to everyday activities in which one takes existing elements and creates something new\u2014such as using the ingredients of sourdough bread to make the pandemic food staple. A new study from the Paris Brain Institute at Sorbonne University decided to investigate the effect the first COVID-19 lockdown had on creativity. To explore its impact, they conducted a French-language online survey to learn more about people\u2019s experiences with creativity during this first lockdown in France. The study\u2019s authors hoped to reconcile the seeming paradox of heightened creativity during a time of unusual stress. The study\u2019s 343 participants said they were, on average, more creative during the lockdown than during the period before. The findings were published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology. What were people doing in lockdown? In addition to listing self-perceived creativity changes, or subjective creativity change (SCC), as described above, the researchers presented participants with an inventory of 28 creative activities based on existing items often used by research psychologists, including the Inventory of Creative Activities and Achievements (ICAA). These included painting, cooking, sewing, gardening, writing, and decorating, among others. Respondents were asked if they engaged in these activities more or less during the lockdown, how often, and why they did or didn\u2019t. The top five creative activities in which the study\u2019s respondents said they engaged in were cooking, sports and dance programs, self-help programs, and gardening. The researchers also inquired about pandemic obstacles that had to be overcome. There was no clear indication that a higher number of obstacles hindered creativity. The extent of obstacles encountered was high for individuals who were more creative as well as for those who were less so. \u201cThe minute you set constraints, now the creative mind gets to work on how do I achieve the goal, conditional on these constraints?\u201d said Dr. Ajay Agrawal, University of Toronto, on the Disruptors podcast. The two greatest factors in whether a person\u2019s level of creativity during the lockdown rose or fell were emotional or affective changes and\u2014to a slightly lesser degree\u2014whether the pandemic gave them more free time. The degree to which an individual exhibits openness\u2014one of the Big Five personality traits\u2014followed behind as a significant factor. The authors chose openness because this is the personality trait most associated with creativity. The role of emotion in creavity According to the study, previous research suggests that a positive mood is correlated to creative activity, although there is still some debate. The authors of the study confirmed that participants\u2019 affective states aligned with SCC. The descriptors they asked participants about \u201cincluded anxiety and stress, motivation, psychological pressure, mood, and to a lower extent, loneliness and physical constraints.\u201d Researchers found a link between positive mood and creativity, and one between negative affective states and less creativity. Co-first author of the study Dr. Aliz\u00e9e Lopez-Persem, suggests: \u201cThere is some evidence in the scientific literature that you need to feel good to be creative, while other evidence points the other way. Also, it is not known in which direction this process takes place: do we feel good because we are creative, or does being creative make us happier?\u201d \u201cHere, one of our analyses suggests that creative expression enabled individuals to better manage their negative emotions linked to confinement and therefore to feel better during this difficult period.\u201d \u2014 Dr. Aliz\u00e9e Lopez-Persem Having more free time The elimination of commuting returned hours to many people, leaving them with more free time, although this was not likely true for everyone. Parents, for example, may have had less free time with children confined at home all day. Participants were asked about how many hours they worked, how much free time, and how much personal space they had. The authors came to this conclusion: \u201cAn increase in free time was linked to higher creativity change.\u201d",

        "link":"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/media\/releases\/2022\/p0831-ccovid-19-opioids.html",
        "text":"The expansion of telehealth services during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with individuals staying in treatment longer and reducing their risk of medically treated overdose, according to a new study. Published today in JAMA Psychiatry, this study was a collaborative effort led by researchers at the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, a part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH); and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). In this national study, researchers analyzed data among 175,778 Medicare beneficiaries from September 2018 to February 2021. The analysis examined the receipt of telehealth services, medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), and experiencing a medically treated overdose among individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) starting a new episode of care prior to the pandemic compared to those during the pandemic. \u201cStrategies to increase access to care and MOUD receipt and retention are urgently needed, and the results of this study add to the growing research documenting the benefits of expanding the use of telehealth services for people with OUD,\u201d said lead author Christopher M. Jones, Pharm.D., Dr.P.H., acting director of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the CDC. \u201cThe findings from this collaborative study also highlight the importance of working across agencies to identify successful approaches to address the escalating overdose crisis.\u201d Among the key findings from this study: Data analyzed from two groups of Medicare beneficiaries, one group initiating an episode of OUD-related care before the COVID-19 pandemic and one initiating care during the COVID-19 pandemic, and found that those in the COVID-19 pandemic group were more likely to receive OUD-related telehealth services compared to the pre-pandemic group (19.6% compared to 0.6%) and were more likely to receive MOUD (12.6% compared to 10.8%). Among the COVID-19 pandemic group, receipt of OUD-related telehealth services was associated with significantly better MOUD treatment retention and lower risk of medically treated overdose compared to those not receiving OUD-related telehealth services, lending support for permanently implementing access to telehealth services. \u201cThe expansion of telehealth services for people with substance use disorders during the pandemic has helped to address barriers to accessing medical care for addiction throughout the country that have long existed,\u201d said Wilson Compton, M.D., M.P.E, deputy director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and senior author of the study. \u201cTelehealth is a valuable service and when coupled with medications for opioid use disorder can be lifesaving. This study adds to the evidence showing that expanded access to these services could have a longer-term positive impact if continued.\u201d Although the study did find that receiving OUD-related telehealth services was generally associated with beneficial outcomes, the study also determined some groups were less likely to receive these services, including non-Hispanic black persons and those living in the South. These outcomes underscore the need for future efforts to focus on eliminating the digital divide and reducing underlying inequities in access to care and services. \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic was an unexpected shock to the US healthcare system, which consequently offered a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of healthcare delivery methods on health outcomes among those who were newly diagnosed with OUD. The findings showed that telehealth improved the receipt and retention of MOUD, suggesting that this method of healthcare delivery may address common barriers to OUD-related treatment such as transportation and perceived stigma associated with OUD,\u201d said lead analyst Carla Shoff, Ph.D., social science research analyst at CMS. This study serves as a supportive resource towards maintaining access to telehealth services for patients with OUD as it demonstrates that Medicare beneficiaries and providers used the new flexibilities related to telehealth services during the COVID-19 pandemic and that these services were associated with positive impacts on patient outcomes such as MOUD treatment receipt, retention, and risk for medically treated overdose.

PEER REVIEWED Summary What is known on this topic? Pre-existing comorbid conditions in COVID-19 patients are risk factors for developing severe disease and death. What is added by this report? Our literature review indicated that chronic liver disease (CLD) is associated with increased adverse clinical outcomes in terms of severity of disease and death among COVID-19 patients. What are the implications for public health practice? Results of our meta-analysis should encourage clinicians worldwide to provide extra attention and intensive care for patients with underlying CLD who develop COVID-19. Abstract Introduction Pre-existing comorbid conditions in COVID-19 patients are risk factors for developing severe disease and death. We aimed to determine the association of chronic liver disease (CLD), a comorbid condition, with severity of disease and death among COVID-19 patients. Methods We searched for studies reporting COVID-19 outcomes among CLD and non-CLD patients in databases including Medline, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library from inception of the pandemic until February 2022. Risk of bias assessment was conducted by using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for assessing the quality of nonrandomized studies in meta-analyses. We conducted a meta-analysis with a random-effects model and reported pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Results We included 40 studies with 908,032 participants. Most studies were conducted in China and the US. COVID-19 patients with CLD had significantly higher odds of having a severe form of COVID-19 (pooled OR = 2.44; 95% CI, 1.89\u20133.16) and death (pooled OR = 2.35; 95% CI, 1.85\u20133.00) when compared with COVID-19 patients without CLD. Conclusion The presence of CLD is significantly related to adverse clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients in terms of severity and mortality. Clinicians should develop a comprehensive intervention plan to manage these high-risk patients and reduce COVID-19\u2013related deaths. Top Introduction A coronavirus is a group of viruses that causes mild to severe respiratory tract infections in humans and animals (1). In recent times, we have witnessed outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (2004), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (2012), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (2019) that belong to this group of viruses (2). The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is the most recent and was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020 (3). As of May 16, 2021, 162 million cases and 3 million deaths were reported globally due to COVID-19 (4). The clinical features range from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia and death. However, patients who have comorbidities are more likely to have a severe form of the condition or to die (5). Chronic liver disease (CLD) is marked by the gradual destruction of liver parenchyma over time. Various factors cause it; the most common are alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), chronic viral hepatitis, and genetic and autoimmune causes (6). Understanding the conditions that lead to severe disease and death among COVID-19\u2013infected people is critical with the evolving pandemic (7). COVID-19 infection highlights the pre-existing weaknesses of the individual organ systems (8), making it logical to postulate that people with CLD may be susceptible to more severe respiratory infections or be at increased risk of death. In addition, it has been proposed that metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) or NAFLD is associated with significant or advanced fibrosis that might exacerbate the \u201ccytokine storm\u201d induced by the COVID-19 infection (9). The mechanism behind this is probably through the release of various proinflammatory hepatokines, which might contribute mechanistically to developing a severe form of COVID-19 infection (9). Several studies have found that hospitalized COVID-19 patients with CLD had an acute rise in liver enzymes, which results in a severe condition requiring mechanical ventilation and even leading to death (10\u201312). Existing evidence on COVID-19 outcomes among CLD patients has reported mixed results, making it difficult to determine a prognosis for these patients (10\u201313). Hence, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to find the association between CLD and the severity of and mortality caused by COVID-19. Top Methods This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies and was performed according to the Preferred Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement guidelines (14). The study protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (registration ID: CRD42021291761). Eligibility criteria We included studies with any of the following study designs: prospective or retrospective cohort, case control, and cross-sectional. Only published full-text studies were included; conference abstracts, unpublished data, and gray literature were excluded. Studies conducted among COVID-19 patients were included; studies among COVID-19 patients with comorbidities other than CLD were excluded. Studies reporting the COVID-19 outcomes among CLD and non-CLD patients were included. CLD patients are diagnosed with the condition by clinical examination, laboratory or radiologic examination, or all 3 investigations. The CLD conditions most commonly found in COVID-19 patients included in our review were cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, NAFLD, and MAFLD. Studies reporting the diagnosis of CLD based on previous medical records were also included in the review. Outcomes were the 1) severity of COVID-19 and 2) mortality due to COVID-19. The severity of the COVID-19 condition can be graded based on any of the following patient criteria: respiratory rate >30 breaths\/min; oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) <93%; oxygenation index (PaO 2 \/FiO 2 ) \u2264300 mm Hg; intensive care unit stay required; or mechanical ventilation (15). Studies reporting any of the outcomes mentioned above were included in our review. Search strategy We conducted a comprehensive, systematic, and extensive search in the electronic databases Medline, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library. We selected the terms required for the search during the protocol stage. We used both the medical subject headings (MeSH) and free-text words while searching these databases. The keywords and their synonyms were searched using appropriate truncations, wildcards, and proximity searching. The terms used to search were \u201cliver disease\u201d\/exp OR \u201chepatic disease\u201d:ti,ab OR \u201chepatic disorder\u201d:ti,ab OR \u201chepatopathy\u201d:ti,ab OR \u201cliver cell disease\u201d:ti,ab OR \u201cliver disease\u201d:ti,ab OR \u201cliver diseases\u201d:ti,ab OR \u201cliver disorder\u201d:ti,ab OR \u201cliver illness\u201d:ti,ab) AND \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d\/exp AND (\u201cmortality\u201d\/exp OR \u201cexcess mortality\u201d OR \u201cmortality\u201d OR \u201cmortality model\u201d OR \u201cdisease severity\u201d\/exp OR \u201cdisease severity\u201d OR \u201cillness severity\u201d OR \u201cseverity, illness\u201d OR \u201ccause of death\u201d\/exp OR \u201ccause of death\u201d OR \u201ccause, death\u201d OR \u201cdeath cause\u201d OR \u201cdeath caused\u201d OR \u201cmortality cause\u201d OR \u201cdeath\u201d\/exp OR \u201cdeath\u201d OR \u201cmortality\u201d. We also searched for crucial concepts using corresponding subject headings in each database. The last search was carried out by combining the individual search results using appropriate Boolean operators (\u201cOR\u201d and \u201cAND\u201d). The search was narrowed down using the available filters on the type of studies. We restricted the search from the inception of the pandemic to February 2022 and published in English only (Supplementary Table 1 available at: https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1mVlexUbFzmHcfvi44LTFi18OmTnMZXtT?usp=sharing). Bibliographies of the retrieved articles were also hand-searched to identify any themes missed during the database search. Study selection process This process involved 3 stages: Primary screening: Two independent investigators (R.N. and Y.K.) performed preliminary screening of title, abstract, and keywords by executing the literature search. Full-text articles were retrieved for the studies shortlisted on the basis of the eligibility criteria. Secondary screening: The same 2 investigators (R.N. and Y.K.) screened the full text of these retrieved studies and assessed them against the review\u2019s eligibility criteria. Studies that satisfied all the eligibility criteria concerning design, participants, exposure, and outcome were included. Finalizing the study selection: Disagreements during the screening process between the investigators were resolved. A final consensus on the inclusion of studies was reached with the help of another investigator (S.R.). Data extraction Data were extracted manually from the included studies using a structured data extraction form that was developed and pilot tested during the protocol stage. We extracted the following data: general information, such as author and year of publication; information related to methods, such as study design, setting, sample size, sampling strategy, study participants, inclusion and exclusion criteria, outcome assessment method, and quality-related information; and information related to outcomes, such as patients\u2019 severity of disease and mortality rates. Data were entered by the investigator (S.R.), and the entry was double checked by the secondary investigator (V.H.). Risk of bias assessment Two independent investigators (S.R. and V.H.) used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess the risk of bias and quality of nonrandomized studies in meta-analyses under 3 domains: selection, comparability, and outcome (16). The quality of the study was graded as good, fair, or poor based on the scores obtained under each domain. Data synthesis We used Stata version 16 (StataCorp LLC) to conduct the meta-analysis. Because all outcomes were dichotomous, the number of events and participants in each group were entered to obtain the pooled effect estimate in terms of odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs and prediction intervals (PIs). We used the random-effects model with the restricted maximum likelihood method to calculate the weights of individual studies (17) because of the clinical and methodologic heterogeneity among the included studies. We used the command meta esize to compute the summary statistic; it automatically adjusts for zero cells by adding 0.5 to all cells in a 2-by-2 table that contains a zero value while computing the summary statistic. Evidence of between-study variance due to heterogeneity was assessed through the \uab532 test of heterogeneity and I2 statistics to quantify the inconsistency. I2 less than 25% is mild, 25% to 75% is moderate, and more than 75% is considered substantial heterogeneity (17). Study-specific and pooled estimates were graphically represented through a forest plot. We also performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the results by removing the studies one at a time and checking for any significant variation in the results. We also performed subgroup analysis on the basis of each type of CLD. We conducted univariable meta-regression with the study-level characteristics using the metareg package in Stata. Publication bias was assessed for each outcome using the funnel plot and Doi plot for visual interpretation and Egger test and Luis Furuya-Kanamori asymmetry index (LFK index) for statistical interpretation (18). Asymmetry of the funnel plot and Doi plot and P value less than .10 in the Egger test indicates the possibility of publication bias. On the basis of the LFK index value, the possibility of publication bias was classified as no asymmetry (value within \u00b11), minor asymmetry (value out of \u00b11 but within \u00b12), and major asymmetry (value more than \u00b12) (18). Top Results We found 3,659 records through the systematic literature search and deemed 221 of those studies relevant for full-text retrieval. We also retrieved the full text for 36 articles obtained through manual searching of the bibliographies in the retrieved studies. During the second screening stage, 40 studies with 908,032 participants met the eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis (Figure 1) (8\u201312,15,19\u201352). This study was reported as per the PRISMA statement guidelines (Supplementary Table 2 available at: https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1mVlexUbFzmHcfvi44LTFi18OmTnMZXtT?usp=sharing).

Abbreviation: PRISMA, Preferred Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. [A text description of this figure is available.] In total, 909,831 participants were found in the included studies, with a sample size ranging from 41 to 259,110 (Table). Among the 40 studies included, 15 reported on mortality due to COVID-19, 14 reported on the severity of COVID-19, and 11 reported both on severity and mortality. All included studies were retrospective; most studies were conducted in China (n = 14) and the US (n = 10). Half (21 of 40) of the included studies were low-quality (ie, per the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) (Supplementary Table 3 available at: https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1mVlexUbFzmHcfvi44LTFi18OmTnMZXtT?usp=sharing) (16). Association between CLD and COVID-19 outcomes Severity In our analysis, 25 studies reported the severity of the CLD and the non-CLD groups (9,10,19\u201321,23,24,27\u201329,31,32,34,36,37,40\u201344,46,49\u201352). The pooled OR was 2.44 (95% CI, 1.89\u20133.16; I2 = 91.3%; 95% PI, 0.79\u20137.55) (Figure 2), indicating that the odds of developing severe disease among COVID-19 patients with CLD were 2.44 times higher than among those without CLD. High heterogeneity was found between the studies reporting the severity outcome (I2 = 91.3%, P < .001). Figure 2.

[A text description of this figure is available.] Subgroup analysis showed that COVID-19 patients with NAFLD had the highest odds of COVID-19 severity (pooled OR = 5.60; 95% CI, 1.52\u201320.64), followed by MAFLD (pooled OR = 3.20; 95% CI, 1.99\u20135.14) and cirrhosis (pooled OR = 3.09; 95% CI, 1.95\u20134.89) (Supplementary Figure 1 available at: https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1mVlexUbFzmHcfvi44LTFi18OmTnMZXtT?usp=sharing). COVID-19 patients who had viral hepatitis did not have significantly higher odds of having a severe form of COVID-19 (pooled OR = 1.29; 95% CI, 0.36\u20134.63). Subgroup analysis by study design showed significantly higher odds of severity in the studies following cohort design (pooled OR = 3.10; 95% CI, 2.08\u20136.60; P = .001) (Supplementary Figure 2 available at: https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1mVlexUbFzmHcfvi44LTFi18OmTnMZXtT?usp=sharing). Results of the univariable meta-regression showed that geographic region, type of CLD, quality of study, year of publication, sample size, and mean age of participants were not significantly associated with the pooled effect size and cannot explain the substantial heterogeneity in the results (Supplementary Table 4 available at: https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1mVlexUbFzmHcfvi44LTFi18OmTnMZXtT?usp=sharing). Publication bias was graphically checked by funnel plot and Doi plot (Supplementary Figures 3 and 4 available at: https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1mVlexUbFzmHcfvi44LTFi18OmTnMZXtT?usp=sharing). The funnel plot showed no sign of asymmetry, and it was also statistically proved by Egger test (P = .36); the Doi plot also showed no asymmetry, with an LFK index of 0.93. Sensitivity analysis showed no significant variation in the magnitude or direction of the outcome, indicating a lack of influence of a single study on the overall pooled estimate (Supplementary Figure 5 available at: https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1mVlexUbFzmHcfvi44LTFi18OmTnMZXtT?usp=sharing). Mortality In total, 26 studies reported on the mortality outcome among CLD and non-CLD patients (8,10\u201312,15,19,20,22,24\u201326,29,30,33,35,38,39,41,44\u201351). The pooled OR was 2.35 (95% CI, 1.84\u20133.00; I2 = 96.26%; 95% PI, 0.76\u20137.18) (Figure 3), indicating that COVID-19 patients with CLD had 2.35 times higher odds of dying as patients without CLD. We found substantial heterogeneity between the studies reporting the mortality outcome (I2 = 96.3%, P < .001). Figure 3. Forest plot showing the difference in mortality between COVID-19 patients with and without chronic liver disease (CLD) (N = 27). [A text description of this figure is available.] Subgroup analysis based on the type of CLD could not be done because only cirrhosis had enough studies to give a pooled estimate (all the other studies reporting mortality outcomes were conducted among CLD patients without categorizing them based on the type of CLD). We found that COVID-19 patients with cirrhosis had 3.51 times higher odds of dying as patients without cirrhosis (pooled OR = 3.51; 95% CI, 2.41\u20135.10) (Supplementary Figure 6 available at: https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1mVlexUbFzmHcfvi44LTFi18OmTnMZXtT?usp=sharing). Subgroup analysis by study design showed significantly higher odds of severity among the studies conducted using a cohort (pooled OR = 2.94; 95% CI, 2.09\u20134.13; P < .001) and a retrospective cohort design (pooled OR = 2.19; 95% CI, 1.51\u20133.17; P < .001) (Supplementary Figure 7 available at: https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1mVlexUbFzmHcfvi44LTFi18OmTnMZXtT?usp=sharing). Univariable meta-regression showed that only the mean age of the patients had a significant association with the pooled effect size (P = .01) and explained 48.3% of the between-study variability (Supplementary Figure 8 available at: https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1mVlexUbFzmHcfvi44LTFi18OmTnMZXtT?usp=sharing). None of the other factors were significantly associated with the pooled effect size and cannot explain the substantial heterogeneity in the results (Supplementary Table 5 available at: https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1mVlexUbFzmHcfvi44LTFi18OmTnMZXtT?usp=sharing). Publication bias was graphically checked by funnel plot and Doi plot (Supplementary Figures 9 and 10 available at: https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1mVlexUbFzmHcfvi44LTFi18OmTnMZXtT?usp=sharing). The funnel plot showed signs of asymmetry, with the Egger test (P = .10) also showing signs of possible publication bias. The Doi plot showed significant asymmetry, with an LFK index of 4.47. Sensitivity analysis showed no significant variation in the magnitude or direction of the outcome, indicating a lack of influence of a single study on the overall pooled estimate (Supplementary Figure 11 available at: https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1mVlexUbFzmHcfvi44LTFi18OmTnMZXtT?usp=sharing). Top Discussion We found that the risk of COVID-19 severity and death was twice as high among CLD patients than among non-CLD patients. Similar results were observed in a review conducted by Wu and Yang in which COVID-19 patients with CLD had more than 4 times the chance of developing severe disease and almost twice the chance of dying compared with non-CLD COVID-19 patients (53). Reviews conducted by Sharma et al and Yadav et al also found higher chances of developing severe disease and death among COVID-19 hospitalized patients with pre-existing liver diseases. Patients with elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were also reported to have higher chances of severe illness and death (54,55). However, a review conducted by Lippi et al states otherwise; no significant changes between liver disease and non\u2013liver disease groups were found with respect to COVID-19 outcomes. However, the studies included in that analysis were limited, so its results should be interpreted cautiously (56). Subgroup analysis based on the type of CLD showed that patients with NAFLD had the highest risk of severe disease, followed by those with MAFLD and cirrhosis. The estimates were also similar compared with the previous review findings (57\u201359). A similar analysis could not be done for mortality outcomes because of limitations in the number of studies. Still, research based on cirrhosis showed a higher effect size than the overall pooled estimate. Understanding the mechanism behind this finding is essential because it will help explain the reason for the association obtained in all the existing evidence. Subgroup analysis was also performed based on the study design adapted to conduct the study. We found higher odds of severity and mortality among studies adapting a cohort design. Though the estimates obtained from a cohort design are considered to be more powerful compared with a case-control or cross-sectional design, we are unclear about how the study design influences the severity and mortality outcome in our review (60). We recommend conducting further studies to evaluate the influence of study design in the outcome of severity and mortality studies. The possible reason for the higher risk of severity among NAFLD patients could be the complex interplay of chronic active inflammatory pathways between the COVID-19\u2013associated cytokine storm and NAFLD (59). Injury caused by the accumulation of fat in the liver could exacerbate the cytokine storm and worsen the prognosis of patients (61). In addition, liver fibrosis has been linked with a higher risk of severity among COVID-19 patients (62). Hence, liver fat accumulation and subsequent fibrosis may be the reasons for NAFLD patients\u2019 more deficient outcomes. A similar mechanism was also observed for MAFLD because it was found to exacerbate the virus-induced inflammatory cytokine storm by increased reactive oxygen production and hepatic release of the proinflammatory cytokines in the COVID-19 patients (57,63). Finally, the possible pathogenesis behind the cirrhosis patients having a higher rate of severity and death following COVID-19 infection could be the excess systemic inflammation, intestinal dysbiosis, cirrhosis-induced immune dysfunction, and coagulopathies (59). Despite all these reasonings and mechanisms, determining the reason for such differential risk associated with different CLD patients is necessary. This determination can be achieved by performing proper longitudinal research in such patients and developing a deeper understanding of this issue. The major strength of our review was the rigorous literature search and methodology followed to provide reliable estimates. In addition, this review adds to the limited evidence available on the prognostic importance of CLD among COVID-19 patients. We also performed additional subgroup analyses to stratify the risk of adverse outcomes based on the type of CLD and study design, meta-regression to explore the source of heterogeneity, and sensitivity analysis to check the robustness of our results. Our study had limitations and findings should be interpreted cautiously, considering the difference in methods and quality across the included studies. Although the review by Mauvais-Jarvis et al stated the influence of gender over disease profile globally and the importance of having gender representation in medical research, our search found that data relevant to evaluating the severity of disease and mortality caused by COVID-19 in CLD patients by gender was lacking in the included studies, which is a limitation in our review (64). Our analysis also found significant between-study variability (significant \u03c72 test for heterogeneity and I2 statistics) for both outcomes. Such high heterogeneity can be attributed to the methodologic differences between the included studies, such as analysis by type of CLD, setting, sample size, and mean age. Meta-regression analysis did not indicate a significant source of heterogeneity for severity outcome and found only mean age as an essential source of heterogeneity for mortality outcome. In addition, we found substantial publication bias for the mortality outcome and found that most of the studies included in our review were of lower quality, which might further limit the generalizability of our study findings. Although our results provide crucial information for better understanding the association of CLD and adverse COVID-19 outcomes, a need exists to perform longitudinal studies to establish the temporality of association and causal link between CLD and adverse clinical effects in the COVID-19 patients. Understanding this link will break a crucial barrier in managing COVID-19 patients and help prevent many deaths worldwide. Our findings have implications for clinical management. Although patients with any liver pathology have some adverse outcomes, the magnitude almost doubles if the patients have CLD. Results of our meta-analysis should encourage clinicians worldwide to provide extra attention and intensive care for patients with CLD, who should be provided with advanced management to prevent adverse clinical outcomes.

        "text":"Today, CDC Director Rochelle P. Walensky, M.D., M.P.H., endorsed the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices\u2019 (ACIP) recommendations for use of updated COVID-19 boosters from Pfizer-BioNTech for people ages 12 years and older and from Moderna for people ages 18 years and older. Updated COVID-19 boosters add Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 spike protein components to the current vaccine composition, helping to restore protection that has waned since previous vaccination by targeting variants that are more transmissible and immune-evading. In the coming weeks, CDC also expects to recommend updated COVID-19 boosters for other pediatric groups, per the discussion and evaluation of the data by ACIP on Sept. 1, 2022. When data are available and FDA authorizes these other types of COVID-19 boosters, CDC will quickly move to help make them available in the United States. The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) authorization of updated COVID-19 boosters, and CDC\u2019s recommendation for use, are critical next steps forward in our country\u2019s vaccination program\u2014a program that has helped provide increased protection against COVID-19 disease and death. The following is attributable to Dr. Walensky: \u201cThe updated COVID-19 boosters are formulated to better protect against the most recently circulating COVID-19 variant. They can help restore protection that has waned since previous vaccination and were designed to provide broader protection against newer variants. This recommendation followed a comprehensive scientific evaluation and robust scientific discussion. If you are eligible, there is no bad time to get your COVID-19 booster and I strongly encourage you to receive it.\u201d",

        "text":"Covid-19 booster shots targeting omicron subvariants received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) this week, and they were recommended Thursday by the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), clearing the way for shots to go into arms within days. \u201cAs we head into fall and begin to spend more time indoors, we strongly encourage anyone who is eligible to consider receiving a booster dose with a bivalent Covid-19 vaccine to provide better protection against currently circulating variants,\u201d FDA commissioner Robert Califf says in a statement. The two new shots, one from Moderna and the other from Pfizer and BioNTech, will be available to anyone who has received their primary or booster dose at least two months ago; neither is meant to be a first vaccination, the FDA says in the statement. Moderna\u2019s formula will be available for anyone 18 years or older, and Pfizer\u2019s will be for those who are 12 or older. The shots, like their earlier counterparts, will be free to the public. The FDA asked manufacturers to develop boosters targeting the newest omicron subvariants in June, writes Science\u2019s Gretchen Vogel. The shots are \u201cbivalent,\u201d because they\u2019re designed to protect against both the original coronavirus strain and the newer BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants, which are considered the most contagious yet, writes Lauran Neergaard of the Associated Press (AP). The vast majority of new infections are caused by these subvariants\u2014with an estimated 89 percent caused by BA.5 alone, according to the CDC. Since mid-July, Covid-19 has killed an average of 400 to 500 Americans per day, according to the New York Times. Though cases are currently trending downward, some experts fear a rise in infections during the fall and winter, and the new boosters are meant to control any upcoming surge. The federal government has already purchased over 170 million doses of the new formulas, per the Washington Post\u2019s Laurie McGinley. Pfizer says it can ship 15 million doses by September 9, and Moderna says it will have shots available nationwide in the coming days, per STAT News\u2019 Matthew Herper. These new boosters received approval based on trials in mice, but human trial data is still to come. To make its decision, the FDA also considered the safety and effectiveness of past Covid-19 shots, and it took into account human data from a clinical trial earlier this year, which tested other omicron-focused mRNA vaccines. Those vaccines were meant to target the BA.1 subvariant, and they are similar to these new booster formulas, per the FDA statement. Authorizing the shots without human clinical trial data is not unheard of\u2014in fact, it mirrors the strategy the FDA uses for new influenza vaccines, writes STAT News. Approaching new Covid-19 boosters in a similar way to flu shots makes sense, Leif Erik Sander, an infectious disease expert at the Charit\u00e9 University Hospital in Germany, tells Science. Getting people updated vaccines as quickly as possible is \u201can ethical issue,\u201d Sander told the publication. \u201cWe need to allow people to protect themselves from a virus that we can\u2019t fully control.\u201d But Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, tells the Post that he wishes human data were available right away to help understand whether the immune response from the new boosters is as good as or better than the response from other vaccines. \u201cWe don\u2019t have data to support that the BA.4\/BA.5 vaccine is superior,\u201d Osterholm says to the Post. Moderna and Pfizer are conducting human studies as the boosters roll out, per the AP. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, tells the Post that the updated boosters will be helpful even if a new variant emerges. And for the time being, the new boosters \u201cwill work better at protecting against omicron\u201d than the current shots do, Andrew Pekosz, a virologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, tells the AP. Since people who have previously been infected with omicron can catch Covid-19 again, \u201cyou should definitely go for the booster even if you\u2019ve been infected in the last year,\u201d Pekosz tells the publication. Editor\u2019s note, Sept. 2, 2022: This story was updated to include the CDC\u2019s recommendation of the shots.",

        "text":"A group of global experts convened by WHO has agreed on new names for monkeypox virus variants, as part of ongoing efforts to align the names of the monkeypox disease, virus and variants \u2013 or clades \u2013 with current best practices. The experts agreed to name the clades using Roman numerals. The monkeypox virus was named upon first discovery in 1958, before current best practices in naming diseases and viruses were adopted. Similarly for the name of the disease it causes. Major variants were identified by the geographic regions where they were known to circulate. Current best practice is that newly-identified viruses, related disease, and virus variants should be given names with the aim to avoid causing offense to any cultural, social, national, regional, professional, or ethnic groups, and minimize any negative impact on trade, travel, tourism or animal welfare. Disease: Assigning new names to existing diseases is the responsibility of WHO under the International Classification of Diseases and the WHO Family of International Health Related Classifications (WHO-FIC). WHO is holding an open consultation for a new disease name for monkeypox. Anyone wishing to propose new names can do so here (see ICD-11, Add proposals). Virus: The naming of virus species is the responsibility of the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), which has a process underway for the name of the monkeypox virus. Variants\/clades: The naming of variants for existing pathogens is normally the result of debate amongst scientists. In order to expedite agreement in the context of the current outbreak, WHO convened an ad hoc meeting on 8 August to enable virologists and public health experts to reach consensus on new terminology. Experts in pox virology, evolutionary biology and representatives of research institutes from across the globe reviewed the phylogeny and nomenclature of known and new monkeypox virus variants or clades. They discussed the characteristics and evolution of monkeypox virus variants, their apparent phylogenetic and clinical differences, and potential consequences for public health and future virological and evolutionary research. The group reached consensus on new nomenclature for the virus clades that is in line with best practices. They agreed on how the virus clades should be recorded and classified on genome sequence repository sites. Consensus was reached to now refer to the former Congo Basin (Central African) clade as Clade one (I) and the former West African clade as Clade two (II). Additionally, it was agreed that the Clade II consists of two subclades. The proper naming structure will be represented by a Roman numeral for the clade and a lower-case alphanumeric character for the subclades. Thus, the new naming convention comprises Clade I, Clade IIa and Clade IIb, with the latter referring primarily to the group of variants largely circulating in the 2022 global outbreak. The naming of lineages will be as proposed by scientists as the outbreak evolves. Experts will be reconvened as needed. The new names for the clades should go into effect immediately while work continues on the disease and virus names.",

        "text":"Excess mortality cannot be derived for all countries when using standard methods because of gaps in the underlying data. Therefore, statistical methods are required to derive the expected and total deaths based on the levels of data available for countries; this is why these figures are called 'estimates'. The methodology for generating the estimates adopts a statistical method called a Poisson regression model and has been developed in collaboration with the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) and an appointed Technical Advisory Group for COVID-19 Mortality Assessment. Our estimates have a range of uncertainty per country and that level of uncertainty is directly related to a country's reporting capacity and variable data quality. As we chart the range between the upper and lower bounds of uncertainty for WHO regions, we are able to observe the relative availability of data for each region and how data gaps disproportionately impact some parts of the world more than others. If the uncertainty bounds are larger, this indicates that there is less available data and therefore, a corresponding greater degree of uncertainty. These ranges in uncertainty serve to highlight the ongoing need and work of WHO, as we partner with countries to strengthen national Health Information Systems, Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Systems and reporting of causes of death, and integrated surveillance systems to help improve data availability and close 'data gaps'.",

        "text":"Conclusions These findings confirm the ongoing unprecedented community transmission of monkeypox virus among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men seen in the UK and many other non-endemic countries. A variable temporal association was observed between mucocutaneous and systemic features, suggesting a new clinical course to the disease. New clinical presentations of monkeypox infection were identified, including rectal pain and penile oedema. These presentations should be included in public health messaging to aid early diagnosis and reduce onward transmission. Results The median age of participants was 38 years. All 197 participants were men, and 196 identified as gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men. All presented with mucocutaneous lesions, most commonly on the genitals (n=111 participants, 56.3%) or in the perianal area (n=82, 41.6%). 170 (86.3%) participants reported systemic illness. The most common systemic symptoms were fever (n=122, 61.9%), lymphadenopathy (114, 57.9%), and myalgia (n=62, 31.5%). 102\/166 (61.5%) developed systemic features before the onset of mucocutaneous manifestations and 64 (38.5%) after (n=4 unknown). 27 (13.7%) presented exclusively with mucocutaneous manifestations without systemic features. 71 (36.0%) reported rectal pain, 33 (16.8%) sore throat, and 31 (15.7%) penile oedema. 27 (13.7%) had oral lesions and 9 (4.6%) had tonsillar signs. 70\/195 (35.9%) participants had concomitant HIV infection. 56 (31.5%) of those screened for sexually transmitted infections had a concomitant sexually transmitted infection. Overall, 20 (10.2%) participants were admitted to hospital for the management of symptoms, most commonly rectal pain and penile swelling. Setting A regional high consequences infectious disease centre with associated primary and secondary care referrals, and affiliated sexual health centres in south London between May and July 2022. The observed clinical features of monkeypox infection in the 2022 UK outbreak differ from those in historical reports. We describe the characteristics and clinical features of monkeypox infection in people managed through a single south London centre and present a series of novel presentations. has an epidemiological link to a confirmed or probable case of monkeypox in the 21 days before symptom onset A person with an unexplained rash on any part of their body plus one or more classical symptom or symptoms of monkeypox infection*\u2020 since 15 March 2022 and either: A person with an illness where the clinician has a high suspicion of monkeypox (for example, this may include prodrome or atypical presentations with exposure histories deemed high risk by the clinician, or classical rash without risk factors). A person with a febrile prodrome* compatible with monkeypox infection where there is known prior contact with a confirmed case in the 21 days before symptom onset. Monkeypox is designated as a high consequence infectious disease in the UK. 18 In the 2022 outbreak, the rapid community spread meant that most infected individuals were managed at home after risk assessment. 19 The box shows the current UK Health Security Agency case definition of possible and probable monkeypox infection. 20 The incubation period of monkeypox is currently understood to be about 12 days (range 5-24 days). 11 12 Classic descriptions of monkeypox infection depict biphasic clinical features, with a prodromal phase characterised by fever, malaise, sweats, lymphadenopathy, and headache, followed by skin eruption 2-4 days later. 11 Skin lesions follow a typical pattern of evolution, starting as macules and progressing into papules, vesicles, and pustules, which subsequently crust over and then desquamate. 13 15 Historically, lesions have appeared simultaneously and progressed sequentially. 16 Lesions have predominantly affected the face (95% of infected people), palms and soles (75%), mucous membranes (70%), and, less commonly, genitals. 5 Most infections are self-limiting and relatively mild, with symptoms lasting 2-4 weeks. Severe manifestations of infection include encephalitis, secondary skin infection, pneumonia, and ocular disease leading to loss of vision. Higher risk populations include neonates, children, and those with immunodeficiency. 17 Monkeypox is due to an orthopoxvirus, which rarely causes disease in humans. Although the exact reservoir of the virus is still unknown, rodents are suspected to play a part in transmission. The virus was first identified in 1958, among primates in captivity for research purposes. 4 Two genetically distinct viral clades are described: Central African (Congo Basin) and West African. 5 The first reports of humans becoming infected were recorded in 1970, when a smallpox-like illness was investigated in areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo thought to be free of variola. 6 7 Monkeypox is endemic in the Congo Basin and West Africa, where outbreaks involving 23 to 88 people have been described. 8 9 Several animal species are susceptible to the infection, and animal to human transmission through handling and ingesting wild game animals has been identified as the primary route of infection in African outbreaks, followed by human to human transmission through close contact with infected individuals. 10 Spread of respiratory droplets and direct contact with skin lesions and scabs have been described as the predominant routes of transmission between humans, but transmission can also occur via fomites. 11 In 2003, the first monkeypox outbreak in the Western hemisphere was reported in 11 people in the United States who had been in close contact with infected prairie dogs. These animals had been transported alongside a Giant Gambian rat, presumed to be the primary source of the infection. 12 Since 2018, travel associated monkeypox infection has been diagnosed in four people in the UK, with onward transmission to three further people. 13 Sporadic cases of imported infections have also been reported in the US, Singapore, and Israel. 14 On 6 May 2022, the UK High Consequence Infectious Diseases (HCID) network was alerted to an individual with monkeypox who had recently returned from West Africa. Six further infected individuals were identified the following week, without epidemiological linkage to West Africa. As of 12 July, 1735 people had been identified with monkeypox in the UK, most (96%) occurring in gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men, and 79% occurring in London. 1 2 People with monkeypox infection have also been reported in several other non-endemic countries in Europe and the Americas, with the highest reported case loads outside of the UK in Spain and Germany. 3 The research question for this study was formed through discussions with patients. Although there was no further direct patient or public involvement in this paper owing to limited resources, we have asked members of the public to read our manuscript after submission and also plan to disseminate key messages through social media and conferences. We calculated means and medians for continuous data, and percentages for nominal data. The Clopper-Pearson exact method was used to calculate confidence intervals for symptom prevalence. Kaplan Meier for length of stay analysis was calculated using Graphpad Prism version 9.3.1. All other analysis was calculated using Microsoft Excel version 16.62. Clinical data were collected through one of three electronic healthcare systems: Electronic Patient Record iSOFT Clinical Manager 1.6 (iSOFT Group, Falls Church, VA), eNoting Client (an in-house patient records system), and preView (IMS MAXIMS, Milton Keynes, UK). Data were collected on personal characteristics, signs and symptoms reported at presentation, mucocutaneous manifestations (description, number, characteristics, and locations), risk factors as defined by the UK Health Security Agency (travel, contacts, and sexual history), HIV status, and sexual health screen results. Typical lesions were defined as macules, papules, vesicles, pustules, umbilication, crust, or scab. All people tested for monkeypox virus between 13 May and 1 July 2022 were identified through routine tracking of samples sent from the centre\u2019s virology laboratory to the Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory. Those who tested positive were included for further study. We conducted a retrospective observational analysis of people with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed monkeypox virus, who were tested and managed through a south London HCID centre. The centre is one of five HCID centres in the UK and serves an inner city central and south London population. Swabs for diagnostic sampling were taken from the lesions at affiliated community sexual health and HIV medicine services, on admission to hospital (inpatient ward or emergency department) or on transfer of patients with suspected monkeypox from neighbouring NHS trusts (see supplementary figure 1). Samples were processed at the Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory at Porton Down, UK. 21 People with suspected and confirmed monkeypox infection were risk stratified according to disease severity, immune status, and their ability to self-isolate, and managed accordingly. As part of routine clinical care, individuals were clinically assessed before testing. All people with a positive PCR test result for monkeypox virus took part in a telephone consultation to be counselled about their result and to conduct a risk assessment. Of the 98\/295 people who tested negative for monkeypox virus by PCR, the most common clinical presentations were rash (n=46, 47.0%), oral or genital ulcers (n=16, 16.3%), and pustules (n=24, 24.5%). Other presentations included rectal symptoms (n=8, 8.2%), sore throat (n=2, 2.0%), fever (n=1, 1.0%), and hidradenitis suppurativa (n=1, 1.0%). Median length of stay for discharged participants was 8 days (interquartile range 3.5 to 10 days) (see supplementary figure 3). One participant remains in hospital, and one additional patient was transferred to a different hospital for capacity reasons. No participants required organ support or died. One participant required patient controlled analgesia with fentanyl for severe rectal pain. Five participants had substantial proctitis confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), one participant with rectal pain developed a rectal perforation that was managed conservatively, and one patient developed necrotising secondary bacterial infection. Participants with rectal pain were treated with oral and topical analgesia (paracetamol, ibuprofen, opioids, and lidocaine gel); rectal suppositories containing emollient, mesalazine, or steroid; and oral laxatives. To date no adverse events associated with these treatments have been observed. The most common clinical reasons for admission were perianal or rectal pain (8\/20 participants) and penile swelling (5\/20). Three participants had perianal or groin abscesses. Two participants had tonsillar abscesses. Two participants required ophthalmology review owing to eye involvement. Urinary retention, superimposed bacterial lower respiratory tract infection, and disseminated lesions in the context of immunocompromise occurred in one patient each. Of 20 participants admitted to hospital for clinical reasons, 15 (75.0%) had HIV co-infection. Three (15.0%) of the admitted participants were considered to have immunosuppression due to either HIV or immunosuppressive treatment. Twenty five (12.7%) participants were admitted to hospital, of whom 20 (10.2% of the total cohort) were admitted for clinical reasons. The remainder were admitted for containment as they were unable to effectively self-isolate at home. Of those tested for concomitant sexually transmitted infections, 34 (21.1%) tested positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 18 (11.2%) for Chlamydia trachomatis, 11 (7.0%) for herpes simplex virus 1 or 2, and 6 (3.7%) for Treponema pallidum ( table 4 ). Overall, 56\/178 (31.5%) participants had a concomitant sexually transmitted infection, and 12 of these cases had more than one simultaneous sexually transmitted infection. Nineteen participants were not screened for any sexually transmitted infection at initial review. Seventy of the 197 (35.5%) participants had HIV-1 co-infection (n=2 unknown). Sixty four (91.4%) of these participants were receiving antiretroviral therapy (n=4 unknown) ( table 3 ). Fifty five (78.6%) had an undetectable HIV-1 viral load (<200 copies\/mL) (n=13 unknown). The median CD4 count was 664 cells\/\u03bcL (interquartile range 522-894 cells\/\u03bcL) (n=40 unknown). Fifty four (27.4%) participants had a history of travel abroad within four weeks before symptom onset. Most common destinations were within western Europe: Spain (20), France (8), Belgium (4), Germany (4), and Greece (4). One participant had returned from an endemic area (West Africa). Forty one of 155 (26.5%) participants reported known close contact with someone who showed symptoms of or had confirmed monkeypox infection (n=42 not recorded). Of the 197 participants, 196 (99.5%) identified as gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men. Notably, 71 (36.0%, 29.3% to 43.2%) participants reported rectal pain or pain on defecation, 33 (16.8%, 11.8% to 22.7%) sore throat, and 31 (15.7%, 11.0% to 21.6%) penile oedema. Overall, 31\/111 (27.9%, 19.8% to 37.2%) participants with genital lesions had penile oedema and 60\/82 (73.2%, 62.2% to 82.4%) participants with perianal lesions had rectal pain. Systemic illness was reported by 170 (86.3%) participants. The most commonly described systemic symptoms were fever (n=122, 61.9%, 54.8% to 68.7%), lymphadenopathy (n=114, 57.9%, 50.6% to 64.9%), and myalgia (n=62, 31.5%, 25.1% to 38.5%) ( table 2 ). In contrast with existing case reports suggesting that prodromal systemic symptoms precede skin lesions, we observed a variable temporal association between mucocutaneous and systemic features. In 102\/166 (61.5%, 53.6% to 68.9%) participants, symptoms developed before the onset of mucocutaneous manifestation and in 64 (38.5%, 31.1% to 46.4%) after (n=4, unknown). Twenty seven participants (13.7%, 9.2% to 19.3%) presented with mucocutaneous manifestations without systemic symptoms. The median number of lesions at presentation was 5 (interquartile range 3-11). Eight (4.1%) participants had more than 100 lesions. A numerical count of lesions was not documented for 29 participants. Twenty two (11.2%, 7.1% to 16.4%) participants presented with a solitary lesion: 12 involved the genitals and seven the perianal area. Twenty seven (13.7%, 9.2% to 19.3%) participants described mucocutaneous manifestations as being pruritic and 27 (13.7%, 9.2% to 19.3%) reported a concomitant widespread maculopapular rash. All 197 participants (100%, 95% confidence interval 97.8% to 100%) presented with mucocutaneous manifestations. These had a range of documented descriptions (see supplementary figure 2) and not all lesions progressed through the traditionally recognised evolution of macule to papule to vesicle to pustule to scab. Lesions were most commonly found on the genitals (n=111, 56.4%, 49.1% to 63.4%) and anus or perianal area (n=82, 41.6%, 34.7% to 48.8%). Genital lesions or perianal lesions, or both, occurred in 174 participants (88.3%, 83.0% to 92.4%) ( table 1 ). Of 295 people tested for monkeypox virus by PCR between 13 May and 1 July 2022, 197 (66.8%) tested positive. Overall, 155 (78.7%) of the participants presented via affiliated sexual health and HIV medicine services, 24 (12.2%) via an emergency department, and 18 (9.1%) after acute admission to a ward. Novel presentations We describe presentations of monkeypox infection in the participants that are not commonly reported. Some symptoms were severe and required hospital admission. Images represent both a range of presentations and a series of progression, giving an insight into the clinical course of the disease in an outbreak largely centred on gay, bisexual, and other men and men who have sex with men. Penile oedema Of the 31 participants who reported penile oedema, five had documented paraphimosis or phimosis. One participant, a 34-year-old circumcised man, presented with multiple penile lesions with clinically significant associated oedema. He had a history of Crohn\u2019s disease and was receiving adalimumab. He initially described multiple small, vesicular lesions on the penile shaft, coronal sulcus, and scrotum, which enlarged over the next two days, becoming umbilicated, flesh coloured papules (fig 1). The lesions then became more indurated, and the patient developed fever and cervical lymphadenopathy. On day 5 of symptoms, he developed erythema and swelling that extended from the mid-penile shaft to the glans. Overnight the swelling progressed rapidly, and the patient was admitted to hospital for assessment. Fig 1 Progression of penile lesions and penile oedema On examination, 14 large, umbilicated lesions were identified along the penile shaft, coronal sulcus, and scrotum. There was associated subcutaneous oedema with no evidence of necrosis, and the skin was not tense or painful. Single pustular lesions on the participant\u2019s arm, back, and hip were also noted, along with inguinal lymphadenopathy. He was able to urinate. Results of a Treponema pallidum particle assay and rectal swab for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis nucleic acid amplification tests were negative, respectively. The urology team advised conservative management with cold compression and massage, and analgesia including topical lidocaine gel, ibuprofen, and oral morphine sulphate. Over the next 48 hours the swelling remained unchanged, with bruising extending from the glans towards the penile base. The swelling subsequently subsided gradually, and the patient was discharged on day 13. By day 16 the swelling had largely resolved, and the penile lesions had crusted over. Secondary bacterial infection One participant, a 47-year-old man with a history of HIV (viral load <200 copies\/mL on antiretroviral therapy, CD4 count 755 cells\/\u03bcL), was referred for review with extensive genital lesions, penile swelling, and purulent penile discharge. He attended the emergency department when he first noticed spreading vesicles on his scrotum. A swab taken from the lesion confirmed monkeypox virus. The patient re-presented to the emergency department with progressive scrotal swelling, pain, and worsening penile ulceration and was subsequently admitted to hospital. On examination, extensive purulent lesions were identified on the penis and scrotum, with surrounding oedema (fig 2, also see supplementary figure 4). Vesicles were also noted on the arms and torso. No pain was elicited during digital rectal examination. Although there was no urinary retention or dysuria, the patient was catheterised because of concerns about increasing swelling of the penis. He was treated with co-amoxiclav to cover for a superadded bacterial infection but was switched to meropenem and clindamycin because of clinical suspicion of Fournier\u2019s gangrene. A swab sample taken from the penis grew Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. Lesions were negative for herpes simplex virus. A computed tomography scan showed extensive penile ulceration, a large hydrocele, and fluid within the scrotum. There was no collection or gas within soft tissue. The participant remains an inpatient at the time of writing. Fig 2 Secondary bacterial infection of penis due to Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. Also see supplementary figure 4 Rectal perforation Overall, 71 (36.0%) participants reported rectal pain or pain on defecation, and this was a common reason for admission (n=8). Five participants had proctitis confirmed on MRI, with one having a perforated rectum and one a perianal abscess. One participant, a 46-year-old man with a history of HIV (viral load <200 copies\/mL on antiretroviral therapy, CD4 count 1200 cells\/\u03bcL), presented with severe rectal pain. Symptoms started with fever, sore throat, and fatigue, followed by severe rectal pain. He was seen in the sexual health service, started on empirical doxycycline for proctitis, and tested for monkeypox virus. Over the next two days the patient developed a papular rash on his upper arms and trunk. A week after symptom onset, the rectal pain became so severe the patient required admission to hospital for pain control. On examination, a papular rash with white exudates was identified in the oral cavity, along with right sided cervical lymphadenopathy. A cluster of tender, white perianal papules were located at the 3 o\u2019clock position. Digital rectal examination elicited noticeable tenderness in the rectum and anal canal. The patient had ongoing fevers and continued to develop new skin lesions. He was started on tecovirimat 600 mg twice daily for 14 days. Results were negative for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis (triple site (throat, rectal, and urethral) sampling). No evidence of concomitant T pallidum infection was found. MRI on day 12 of symptoms showed active proctitis with evidence of a localised lower rectal wall perforation and associated collection (fig 3). The patient was treated conservatively with intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole. Fig 3 T2 weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan of pelvis showing a 3.5 cm cavity in left mesorectum, adjacent to the rectal wall representing an area of localised perforation (arrow) Solitary lesion In total, 22 (11.2%) participants presented with a solitary cutaneous lesion. One participant, a 53-year-old man with a history of HIV (viral load <200 copies\/mL on antiretroviral therapy), presented with a single skin lesion on his thigh. Initially this was a small papule on the medial right thigh but developed into a painful mass with surrounding erythema. After review by a general practitioner, the patient started flucloxacillin, but with no benefit. He presented to the emergency department because the lesion had increased in size. He had no associated fever or other systemic symptoms. On examination a 4\u00d72 cm, tender area of induration with a central area of crusting was noted, along with bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy (fig 4). The patient was admitted to hospital for treatment with intravenous antibiotics and further investigation. Ultrasound imaging showed inflamed subcutaneous tissues within the upper right thigh, with a tract to a further lesion in the upper right outer thigh, and reactive groin lymph nodes (see supplementary figure 5). Samples were negative for Leishmania, Rickettsiae, and T pallidum, and for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis (triple site (throat, rectal, and urethral) sampling). The patient was discharged with oral co-amoxiclav. However, because of ongoing symptoms and the increase of monkeypox infection in the UK, he was reassessed and tested for monkeypox virus, with a positive result 13 days after symptom onset. How the patient became infected is unclear and there was no known sexual or other exposure to the virus. The patient was reviewed on day 18 by virtual consultation, at which time the crust on the thigh lesion had fallen off. Fig 4 Development of solitary lesion on right upper inner thigh, tracking laterally to outer thigh. Also see supplementary figure 5 Polymorphic lesions Seventy (35.5%) participants had cutaneous manifestations at different stages of evolution at a single time point documented in the clinical notes. One participant, a 48-year-old man, presented with polymorphic skin lesions having first noticed a single erosion on his scrotum, which spread to the penile base and foreskin. On day 3 he developed pustular lesions with an erythematous base on his arms, behind his knee, below his ear, and on the bridge of his nose (fig 5). He attended the sexual health service and emergency department with ulcerated genital lesions and was treated with flucloxacillin. On day 5 he developed systemic symptoms, including fever, myalgia, back pain, headaches, and lethargy. By day 17 the genital lesions had crusted over; however, the patient developed new pustular lesions on his hands. By day 24, the lesions on the hands, legs, and face had crusted over. The previously crusted scrotal and penile lesions became ulcerated, and the patient was treated with co-amoxiclav for a suspected secondary bacterial infection. A swab grew Streptococcus pyogenes. Screening results were negative for herpes simplex virus, T pallidum, N gonorrhoeae, and C trachomatis. Fig 5 Cutaneous lesions on the nose, hand, and penis over time. On day 17 there were fresh pustular lesions on the hand, a partly scabbed lesion on the face, and fully scabbed lesions on the penis Maculopapular rash Twenty seven (13.7%) participants reported an erythematous maculopapular rash of varying distribution and rapid onset, separate to areas of blistering or pustules. One of these participants had positive syphilis serology (n=4 unknown). One participant, a 36-year-old man with a history of HIV (viral load <200 copies\/mL on antiretroviral therapy, CD4 count >400 cells\/\u03bcL), reported a rapidly progressive maculopapular rash soon after developing perianal vesicles. The vesicles initially progressed into three pruritic, pustular, perianal lesions. On day 4 the patient presented to the sexual health service with rectal pain, tenesmus, rectal bleeding, and difficulty defecating. He was treated empirically for proctitis with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily and aciclovir 400 mg three times daily. On day 6 the patient awoke to a widespread symmetrical, pruritic maculopapular rash across his torso, back, legs, and buttocks, and reported inguinal lymphadenopathy (fig 6; also see supplementary figure 6). He denied any fever or systemic features. Results for herpes simplex virus, N gonorrhoeae, and C trachomatis (3 in 1 sampling) and T pallidum were negative. By day 8 the perianal lesions had begun to crust over, tenesmus had improved, and the rash had started to diminish. Fig 6 Symmetrical maculopapular rash of the torso, back, and buttocks. Also see supplementary figure 6 Oropharyngeal manifestations Twenty seven (13.7%) participants had oropharyngeal lesions and nine (4.6%) had tonsillar erythema, pustules, oedema, or abscess. One participant, a 25-year-old man, presented with a right sided tonsillar abscess. He described developing right sided neck pain, quickly followed by an erythematous, pruritic rash over his trunk. He subsequently developed fever, progressively worsening right submandibular swelling, and pain, and he reported fatigue. The swelling increased, resulting in dysphagia and difficulty breathing. The patient was referred to his local ear, nose, and throat centre where a right tonsillar abscess was observed. A single papule was noted on the patient\u2019s right forearm. A swab taken from the papule tested positive for monkeypox virus, and the patient was transferred to the high consequence infectious diseases ward. On examination he had a widespread symmetrical erythematous maculopapular rash over his chest (sparing the midline), back, and upper arms, with areas of confluent erythema (fig 7). Smaller areas of a petechial rash were also noted. The right tonsil was enlarged, with an overlying pustular lesion and yellow-green exudate, with associated right cervical lymphadenopathy (fig 7). A small, crusted lesion was evident on each antecubital fossa. The patient had no genital or anal lesions. He was treated with benzylpenicillin and metronidazole. Tonsillar and skin swabs tested positive for monkeypox virus by PCR. Over the course of hospital admission, the rash subsided and the dysphagia improved. Two repeat throat swabs tested positive for monkeypox virus by PCR. Results for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis were negative. Additionally, test results for blood cultures, respiratory viral screen, herpes simplex virus, and varicella zoster virus PCR, and HIV, Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and mumps IgM were all negative. Fig 7 (Left) Symmetrical erythematous maculopapular rash on back and upper arms, with areas of confluent erythema. (Right) Right tonsillar enlargement with an overlying pustular lesion and yellow-green exudate with slight deviation of the uvula Abscesses Two participants had soft tissue abscesses identified on ultrasound examination. One of these participants, a 45-year-old man with a history of HIV (viral load <200 copies\/mL on antiretroviral therapy), presented with a left sided groin abscess 10 days after he had shaved the area. The patient attended the emergency department for a left inguinal swelling, which had enlarged over three days, and the patient had associated fever and headache. The swelling had an overlying pustule, which the patient had described as an ingrown hair follicle. On examination, the swelling, measuring 6\u00d78 cm, was incised and drained by the surgical team. The next evening the patient developed papules and pustules over the mons pubis and face, followed by his neck, wrists, and back (eight lesions in total). Test results for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis (triple site (throat, rectal, and urethral) sampling) were negative. About five days later all the lesions had crusted over.",

        "text":"Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that several personal protective and social measures, including handwashing, mask wearing, and physical distancing are associated with reductions in the incidence covid-19. Public health efforts to implement public health measures should consider community health and sociocultural needs, and future research is needed to better understand the effectiveness of public health measures in the context of covid-19 vaccination. Results 72 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 35 evaluated individual public health measures and 37 assessed multiple public health measures as a \u201cpackage of interventions.\u201d Eight of 35 studies were included in the meta-analysis, which indicated a reduction in incidence of covid-19 associated with handwashing (relative risk 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 1.12, I 2 =12%), mask wearing (0.47, 0.29 to 0.75, I 2 =84%), and physical distancing (0.75, 0.59 to 0.95, I 2 =87%). Owing to heterogeneity of the studies, meta-analysis was not possible for the outcomes of quarantine and isolation, universal lockdowns, and closures of borders, schools, and workplaces. The effects of these interventions were synthesised descriptively. Data synthesis DerSimonian Laird random effects meta-analysis was performed to investigate the effect of mask wearing, handwashing, and physical distancing measures on incidence of covid-19. Pooled effect estimates with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were computed, and heterogeneity among studies was assessed using Cochran\u2019s Q test and the I 2 metrics, with two tailed P values. Previous systematic reviews on the effectiveness of public health measures to treat covid-19 lacked the inclusion of analytical studies, 20 a comprehensive approach to data synthesis (focusing only on one measure), 21 a rigorous assessment of effectiveness of public health measures, 22 an assessment of the certainty of the evidence, 23 and robust methods for comparative analysis. 24 To tackle these gaps, we performed a systematic review of the evidence on the effectiveness of both individual and multiple public health measures in reducing the incidence of covid-19, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and covid-19 mortality. When feasible we also did a critical appraisal of the evidence and meta-analysis. Substantial benefits in reducing mortality were observed in countries with universal lockdowns in place, such as Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and China. Universal lockdowns are not, however, sustainable, and more tailored interventions need to be considered; the ones that maintain social lives and keep economies functional while protecting high risk individuals. 16 17 Substantial variation exists in how different countries and governments have applied public health measures, 18 and it has proved a challenge for assessing the effectiveness of individual public health measures, particularly in policy decision making. 19 Public health (or non-pharmaceutical) interventions have been shown to be beneficial in fighting respiratory infections transmitted through contact, droplets, and aerosols. 14 15 Given that SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible, it is a challenge to determine which measures might be more effective and sustainable for further prevention. Globally, vaccination programmes have proved to be safe and effective and save lives. 4 5 Yet most vaccines do not confer 100% protection, and it is not known how vaccines will prevent future transmission of SARS-CoV-2, 6 given emerging variants. 7 8 9 The proportion of the population that must be vaccinated against covid-19 to reach herd immunity depends greatly on current and future variants. 10 This vaccination threshold varies according to the country and population\u2019s response, types of vaccines, groups prioritised for vaccination, and viral mutations, among other factors. 6 Until herd immunity to covid-19 is reached, regardless of the already proven high vaccination rates, 11 public health preventive strategies are likely to remain as first choice measures in disease prevention, 12 particularly in places with a low uptake of covid-19 vaccination. Measures such as lockdown (local and national variant), physical distancing, mandatory use of face masks, and hand hygiene have been implemented as primary preventive strategies to curb the covid-19 pandemic. 13 A variety of containment and mitigation strategies have been adopted to adequately respond to covid-19, with the intention of deferring major surges of patients in hospitals and protecting the most vulnerable people from infection, including elderly people and those with comorbidities. 3 Strategies to achieve these goals are diverse, commonly based on national risk assessments that include estimation of numbers of patients requiring hospital admission and availability of hospital beds and ventilation support. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 on global public health and economies has been profound. 1 As of 14 October 2021, there were 239 007 759 million cases of confirmed covid-19 and 4 871 841 million deaths with covid-19 worldwide. 2 No patients or members of the public were directly involved in this study as no primary data were collected. A member of the public was, however, asked to read the manuscript after submission. Because of the differences in the effect metrics reported by the included studies, we could only perform quantitative data synthesis for three interventions: handwashing, face mask wearing, and physical distancing. Odds ratios or relative risks with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were reported for the associations between the public health measures and incidence of covid-19. When necessary, we transformed effect metrics derived from different studies to allow pooled analysis. We used the Dersimonian Laird random effects model to estimate pooled effect estimates along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals for each measure. Heterogeneity among individual studies was assessed using the Cochran Q test and the I 2 test. 31 All statistical analyses were conducted in R (version 4.0.3) and all P values were two tailed, with P=0.05 considered to be significant. For the remaining studies, when meta-analysis was not feasible, we reported the results in a narrative synthesis. The DerSimonian and Laird method was used for random effects meta-analysis, in which the standard error of the study specific estimates was adjusted to incorporate a measure of the extent of variation, or heterogeneity, among the effects observed for public health measures across different studies. It was assumed that the differences between studies are a result of different, yet related, intervention effects being estimated. If fewer than five studies were included in meta-analysis, we applied a recommended modified Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method. 30 SS, JR, XL, WX, IME, and XZ independently assessed risk of bias for each study, which was cross checked by ST and HW. For non-interventional observational studies, a ROBINS-I (risk of bias in non-randomised studies of interventions) risk of bias tool was used. 28 For interventional studies, a revised tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials (RoB 2) tool was used. 29 Reviewers rated each domain for overall risk of bias as low, moderate, high, or serious\/critical. Authors ST, DG, SS, AM, ET, JR, XL, WX, IME, and XZ independently screened the titles and abstracts and excluded studies that did not match the inclusion criteria. Discrepancies were resolved in discussion with the main author (ST). The same authors retrieved full text articles and determined whether to include or exclude studies on the basis of predetermined selection criteria. Using a pilot tested data extraction form, authors ST, SS, AM, JR, XL, WX, AM, IME, and XZ independently extracted data on study design, intervention, effect measures, outcomes, results, and limitations. ST, SS, AM, and HW verified the extracted data. Table 5 in supplementary material 1 provides the specific criteria used to assess study designs. Given the heterogeneity and diversity in how studies defined public health measures, we took a common approach to summarise evidence of these interventions (supplementary material 1, table 6). We carried out electronic searches of Medline, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Ebsco), Global Health, Biosis, Joanna Briggs, and the WHO COVID-19 database (for preprints). A clinical epidemiologist (ST) developed the initial search strategy, which was validated by two senior medical librarians (LR and MD) (supplementary material 1, table 4). The updated search strategy was last performed on 7 June 2021. All citations identified from the database searches were uploaded to Covidence, an online software designed for managing systematic reviews, 27 for study selection. Given that the scientific community is concerned about the ability of the numerous mathematical models, which are based on assumptions, to predict the course of virus transmission or effectiveness of interventions, 26 this review focused only on empirical studies. We excluded case reports and case studies, modelling and simulation studies, studies that provided a graphical summary of measures without clear statistical assessments or outputs, ecological studies that provided a descriptive summary of the measures without assessing linearity or having comparators, non\u2010empirical studies (eg, commentaries, editorials, government reports), other reviews, articles involving only individuals exposed to other pathogens that can cause respiratory infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome, and articles in a language other than English. Articles that met the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and study design criteria were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review (supplementary material 1, table 3). Specifically, preventive public health measures that were tested independently were included in the main analysis. Multiple measures, which generally contain a \u201cpackage of interventions\u201d, were included as supplementary material owing to the inability to report on the individual effectiveness of measures and comparisons on which package led to enhanced outcomes. The public health measures were identified from published World Health Organization sources that reported on the effectiveness of such measures on a range of communicable diseases, mostly respiratory infections, such as influenza. Overall, 37 studies provided estimates on the effectiveness of multiple public health measures, assessed as a collective group. Studies were mostly conducted in Asia (n=15), the US (n=11), Europe (n=6), Africa (n=4), and South America (n=1). All the studies were observational. The most commonly measured outcome was transmission of disease (ie, measured as reproductive number, growth number, or epidemic doubling time) (n=23), followed by covid-19 incidence (n=19) and covid-19 mortality (n=8). This review attempted to assess the overall effectiveness of the public health intervention packages by reporting the percentage difference in outcome before and after implementation of measures or between regions or countries studied. Eleven of the 37 included studies noted a difference of between 26% and 50% in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and incidence of covid-19, 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 nine noted a difference of between 51% and 75% in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, covid-19 incidence, and covid-19 mortality, 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 and 14 noted a difference of more than 75% in transmission of SARS-CoV-2, covid-19 incidence and covid-19 mortality. 79 80 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 For the remaining studies, the overall effectiveness was not assessed owing to a lack of comparators (see supplementary material 3, table 3). Two studies that assessed universal lockdown and physical distancing reported a decrease of between 0% and 25% in SARS-CoV-2 transmission and covid-19 incidence. 79 101 Studies that included school and workplace closures, 91 95 96 isolation or stay at home measures, 80 94 or a combination of both 79 89 93 97 98 99 reported decreases of more than 75% in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Supplementary material 3, table 2 provides detailed information on each study. One retrospective cohort study assessed screening of symptoms, which involved testing 65 000 people for fever ( table 3 ). 54 The study found that screening for fever lacked sensitivity (ranging from 18% to 24%) in detecting people with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This translated to 86% of the population with SARS-CoV-2 remaining undetected when screening for fever. The study was rated at moderate risk of bias ( fig 2 ). Border closure was assessed in one natural experiment study involving nine African countries ( table 3 ). 62 Overall, the countries recorded an increase in the incidence of covid-19 after border closure. These studies concluded that the implementation of border closures within African countries had minimal effect on the incidence of covid-19. The study had important limitations and was rated at serious or critical risk of bias. In the US, a natural experiment study reported that restrictions on travel between states contributed about 11% to a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 transmission ( table 3 ). 36 The study was rated at moderate risk of bias ( fig 2 ). Four studies assessed universal lockdown and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during the first few months of the pandemic ( table 2 ). The decrease in reproductive number (R0) ranged from 1.27 in Italy (pre-intervention 2.03, post-intervention 0.76) 39 to 2.09 in India (pre-intervention 3.36, post-intervention 1.27), 64 and 3.97 in China (pre-intervention 4.95, post-intervention 0.98). 33 A natural experiment from the US reported that lockdown was associated with an 11% reduction in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (relative risk 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.88 to 0.91). 40 All the studies were rated at low risk of bias 33 39 to moderate risk 40 64 ( fig 2 ). The three studies that assessed universal lockdown and covid-19 mortality generally reported a decrease in mortality ( table 2 ). 35 38 42 A natural experiment study involving 45 US states reported a decrease in covid-19 related mortality of 2.0% (95% confidence interval \u22123.0% to 0.9%) daily after lockdown had been made mandatory. 35 A Brazilian quasi-experimental study reported a 27.4% average difference in covid-19 related mortality rates in the first 25 days of lockdown. 42 In addition, a natural experiment study reported about 30% and 60% reductions in covid-19 related mortality post-lockdown in Italy and Spain over four weeks post-intervention, respectively. 38 All three studies were rated at moderate risk of bias ( fig 2 ). A natural experiment involving 202 countries suggested that countries that implemented universal lockdown had fewer new cases of covid-19 than countries that did not (\u03b2 coefficient \u2212235.8 (standard error \u221211.04), P<0.01) ( table 2 ). 52 An Indian quasi-experimental study reported a 10.8% reduction in incidence of covid-19 post-lockdown, 56 whereas a South African retrospective cohort study observed a 14.1% reduction in risk after implementation of universal lockdown ( table 2 ). 46 These studies were rated at high risk of bias 52 and moderate risk of bias 46 56 ( fig 2 ). Two natural experiment studies assessed business closures across 50 US states and reported reductions in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 ( table 2 ). 40 58 One of the studies observed a significant reduction in transmission of 12% (relative risk 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 0.89) 40 and the other reported a significant 16% (risk ratio 0.84, 0.79 to 0.90) reduction. 58 Both studies were rated at moderate risk of bias ( fig 2 ). Two natural experiments from the US reported a reduction in transmission (ie, reproductive number); with one study reporting a reduction of 13% (relative risk 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 0.89) 40 and another reporting a 10% (0.90, 0.86 to 0.93) reduction ( table 2 ). 58 A Swedish study reported an association between school closures and a small increase in confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in parents (odds ratio 1.17, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.32), but observed that teachers in lower secondary schools were twice as likely to become infected than teachers in upper secondary schools (2.01, 1.52 to 2.67). 32 All three studies were rated at moderate risk of bias ( fig 2 ). Two studies assessed the effectiveness of school closures on transmission of SARS-CoV-2, incidence of covid-19, or covid-19 mortality ( table 2 ). 44 48 A US population based longitudinal study reported on the effectiveness of state-wide closure of primary and secondary schools and observed a 62% decrease (95% confidence interval \u221249% to \u221271%) in incidence of covid-19 and a 58% decrease (\u221246% to\u221268%) in covid-19 mortality. 48 Conversely, a natural experiment from Japan reported no effect of school closures on incidence of covid-19 (\u03b1 coefficient 0.08, 95% confidence interval \u22120.36 to 0.65). 44 Both studies were rated at moderate risk of bias ( fig 2 ). Quarantine was assessed in two studies ( table 2 ). 34 59 A prospective cohort study from Saudi Arabia reported a 4.9% decrease in the incidence of covid-19 at eight weeks after the implementation of quarantine. 34 This study was rated at low risk of bias ( fig 2 ). A retrospective cohort study from India reported a 14 times higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with no quarantine compared with strict quarantine (odds ratio 14.44, 95% confidence interval 2.42 to 86.17). 59 This study was rated at moderate risk of bias ( fig 2 ). A study from the UK reported a 74% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed for each participant and estimated a decrease in reproductive number: the reproductive number pre-intervention was 3.6 and post-intervention was 0.60 (95% confidence interval 0.37 to 0.89). 65 Similarly, an Iranian study projected the reproductive number using serial interval distribution and the number of incidence cases and found a significant decrease: the reproductive number pre-intervention was 2.70 and post-intervention was 1.13 (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.25). 55 Three of the studies were rated at moderate to serious or critical risk of bias, 55 58 65 and one study was rated at low risk of bias 41 ( fig 2 ). All the studies that assessed stay at home or isolation measures reported reductions in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 ( table 2 ). A retrospective cohort study from the US reported a significant reduction in the odds of having a positive reproductive number (R0) result (odds ratio 0.07, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.37), 41 and a natural experiment reported a 51% reduction in time varying reproductive number (Rt) (risk ratio 0.49, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 0.54). 58 Studies that assessed physical distancing but were not included in the meta-analysis because of substantial differences in outcomes assessed, generally reported a positive effect of physical distancing ( table 2 ). A natural experiment from the US reported a 12% decrease in SARS-CoV-2 transmission (relative risk 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 0.89), 40 and a quasi-experimental study from Iran reported a reduction in covid-19 related mortality (\u03b2 \u22120.07, 95% confidence interval \u22120.05 to \u22120.10; P<0.001). 47 Another comparative study in Kenya also reported a reduction in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 after physical distancing was implemented, reporting 62% reduction in overall physical contacts (reproductive number pre-intervention was 2.64 and post-intervention was 0.60 (interquartile range 0.50 to 0.68)). 61 These three studies were rated at moderate risk of bias 40 61 to serious or critical risk of bias 47 ( fig 2 ). Five studies with a total of 2727 people with SARS-CoV-2 and 108 933 participants were included in the analysis that examined the effect of physical distancing on the incidence of covid-19. 37 53 57 60 63 Overall pooled analysis indicated a 25% reduction in incidence of covid-19 (relative risk 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 0.95, I 2 =87%) ( fig 6 ). Heterogeneity among studies was substantial, and risk of bias ranged from moderate 37 53 57 60 to serious or critical 63 ( fig 2 ). Only one study, from China, reported the association between disinfection of surfaces and risk of secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within households ( table 1 ). 57 The study assessed disinfection retrospectively by asking participants about their \u201cdaily use of chlorine or ethanol-based disinfectant in households,\u201d and observed that use of disinfectant was 77% effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission (odds ratio 0.23, 95% confidence interval 0.07 to 0.84). The study did not collect data on the concentration of the disinfectant used by participants and was rated at moderate risk of bias ( fig 2 ). A comparative study in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region reported a statistically significant lower cumulative incidence of covid-19 associated with mask wearing than in selected countries where mask wearing was not mandatory ( table 1 ). 68 Similarly, another natural experiment involving 15 US states reported a 2% statistically significant daily decrease in covid-19 transmission (measured as case growth rate) at \u226521 days after mask wearing became mandatory, 50 whereas a cross sectional study reported that a 10% increase in self-reported mask wearing was associated with greater odds for control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (adjusted odds ratio 3.53, 95% confidence interval 2.03 to 6.43). 45 The five studies were rated at moderate risk of bias ( fig 2 ). Mask wearing and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, covid-19 incidence, and covid-19 mortality\u2014The results of additional studies that assessed mask wearing (not included in the meta-analysis because of substantial differences in the assessed outcomes) indicate a reduction in covid-19 incidence, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and covid-19 mortality. Specifically, a natural experiment across 200 countries showed 45.7% fewer covid-19 related mortality in countries where mask wearing was mandatory ( table 1 ). 49 Another natural experiment study in the US reported a 29% reduction in SARS-CoV-2 transmission (measured as the time varying reproductive number Rt) (risk ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.58 to 0.75) in states where mask wearing was mandatory. 58 Mask wearing and covid-19 incidence\u2014Six studies with a total of 2627 people with covid-19 and 389 228 participants were included in the analysis examining the effect of mask wearing on incidence of covid-19 ( table 1 ). 36 43 57 60 63 66 Overall pooled analysis showed a 53% reduction in covid-19 incidence (0.47, 0.29 to 0.75), although heterogeneity between studies was substantial (I 2 =84%) ( fig 5 ). Risk of bias across the six studies ranged from moderate 36 57 60 66 to serious or critical 43 63 ( fig 2 ). Handwashing and covid-19 incidence\u2014Three studies with a total of 292 people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 10 345 participants were included in the analysis of the effect of handwashing on incidence of covid-19. 36 60 63 Overall pooled analysis suggested an estimated 53% non-statistically significant reduction in covid-19 incidence (relative risk 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 1.12, I 2 =12%) ( fig 3 ). A sensitivity analysis without adjustment showed a significant reduction in covid-19 incidence (0.49, 0.33 to 0.72, I 2 =12%) ( fig 4 ). Risk of bias across the three studies ranged from moderate 36 60 to serious or critical 63 ( fig 2 ). Thirty five studies provided estimates on the effectiveness of an individual public health measures. The studies were conducted in Asia (n=11), the United States (n=9), Europe (n=7), the Middle East (n=3), Africa (n=3), South America (n=1), and Australia (n=1). Thirty four of the studies were observational and one was a randomised controlled trial. The study designs of the observational studies comprised natural experiments (n=11), quasi-experiments (n=3), a prospective cohort (n=1), retrospective cohorts (n=8), case-control (n=2), and cross sectional (n=9). Twenty six studies assessed social measures, 32 34 35 37 38 39 40 41 42 44 46 47 48 52 53 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 63 64 65 67 12 studies assessed personal protective measures, 36 43 45 49 50 57 58 60 63 66 68 three studies assessed travel related measures, 54 58 62 and one study assessed environmental measures 57 (some interventions overlapped across studies). The most commonly measured outcome was incidence of covid-19 (n=18), followed by SARS-CoV-2 transmission, measured as reproductive number, growth number, or epidemic doubling time (n=13), and covid-19 mortality (n=8). Table 1 in supplementary material 3 provides detailed information on each study. According to the ROBINS-I tool, 28 the risk of bias was rated as low in three studies, 32 33 34 moderate in 24 studies, 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 and high to serious in seven studies. 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 One important source of serious or critical risk of bias in most of the included studies was major confounding, which was difficult to control for because of the novel nature of the pandemic (ie, natural settings in which multiple interventions might have been enforced at once, different levels of enforcement across regions, and uncaptured individual level interventions such as increased personal hygiene). Variations in testing capacity and coverage, changes to diagnostic criteria, and access to accurate and reliable outcome data on covid-19 incidence and covid-19 mortality, was a source of measurement bias for numerous studies ( fig 2 ). These limitations were particularly prominent early in the pandemic, and in low income environments. 47 52 62 63 65 The randomised controlled trial 66 was rated as moderate risk of bias according to the ROB-2 tool. Missing data, losses to follow-up, lack of blinding, and low adherence to intervention all contributed to the reported moderate risk. Tables 1 and 2 in supplementary material 2 summarise the risk of bias assessment for each study assessing individual measures. A total of 36 729 studies were initially screened, of which 36 079 were considered irrelevent. After exclusions, 650 studies were eligible for full text review and 72 met the inclusion criteria. Of these studies, 35 assessed individual interventions and were included in the final synthesis of results ( fig 1 ) and 37 assessed multiple interventions as a package and are included in supplementary material 3, tables 2 and 3. The included studies comprised 34 observational studies and one interventional study, eight of which were included in the meta-analysis. Discussion Worldwide, government and public health organisations are mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by implementing various public health measures. This systematic review identified a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of covid-19 through the implementation of mask wearing and physical distancing. Handwashing interventions also indicated a substantial reduction in covid-19 incidence, albeit not statistically significant in the adjusted model. As the random effects model tends to underestimate confidence intervals when a meta-analysis includes a small number of individual studies (<5), the adjusted model for handwashing showed a statistically non-significant association in reducing the incidence of covid-19 compared with the unadjusted model. Overall effectiveness of these interventions was affected by clinical heterogeneity and methodological limitations, such as confounding and measurement bias. It was not possible to evaluate the impact of type of face maks (eg, surgical, fabric, N95 respirators) and compliance and frequency of wearing masks owing to a lack of data. Similarly, it was not feasible to assess the differences in effect that different recommendations for physical distancing (ie, 1.5 m, 2m, or 3 m) have as preventive strategies. The effectiveness of measures such as universal lockdowns and closures of businesses and schools for the containment of covid-19 have largely been effective, but depended on early implementation when incidence rates of covid-19 were still low.425258 Only Japan reported no decrease in covid-19 incidence after school closures,44 and other studies found that different public health measures were sometimes implemented simultaneously or soon after one another, thus the results should be interpreted with caution.324656 Isolation or stay at home was an effective measure in reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but the included studies used results for mobility to assess stay at home or isolation and therefore could have been limited by potential flaws in publicly available phone data,4158102 and variations in the enforcement of public health measures in different states or regions were not assessed.5558102 Quarantine was found to be as effective in reducing the incidence of covid-19 and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, yet variation in testing and case detection in low income environments was substantial.599698 Another study reported that quarantine was effective in reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort with a low prevalence of the virus, yet it is unknown if the same effect would be observed with higher prevalence.34 It was not possible to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of restricted travel and full border closures because the number of empirical studies was insufficient. Single studies identified that border closure in Africa had a minimal effect in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but the study was assessed as being at high risk of bias.62 Screening for fever was also identified to be ineffective, with only 24% of positive cases being captured by screening.54 Comparison with other studies Previous literature reviews have identified mask wearing as an effective measure for the containment of SARS-CoV-2103; the caveat being that more high level evidence is required to provide unequivocal support for the effectiveness of the universal use of face masks.104105 Additional empirical evidence from a recent randomised controlled trial (originally published as a preprint) indicates that mask wearing achieved a 9.3% reduction in seroprevalence of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and an 11.9% reduction in the prevalence of covid-19-like symptoms.106 Another systematic review showed stronger effectiveness with the use of N95, or similar, respirators than disposable surgical masks,107 and a study evaluating the protection offered by 18 different types of fabric masks found substantial heterogeneity in protection, with the most effective mask being multilayered and tight fitting.108 However, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 largely arises in hospital settings in which full personal protective measures are in place, which suggests that when viral load is at its highest, even the best performing face masks might not provide adequate protection.51 Additionally, most studies that assessed mask wearing were prone to important confounding bias, which might have altered the conclusions drawn from this review (ie, effect estimates might have been underestimated or overestimated or can be related to other measures that were in place at the time the studies were conducted). Thus, the extent of such limitations on the conclusions drawn remain unknown. A 2020 rapid review concluded that quarantine is largely effective in reducing the incidence of covid-19 and covid-19 mortality. However, uncertainty over the magnitude of such an effect still remains,109 with enhanced management of quality quarantine facilities for improved effective control of the epidemics urgently needed.110 In addition, findings on the application of school and workplace closures are still inconclusive. Policy makers should be aware of the ambiguous evidence when considering school closures, as other potentially less disruptive physical distancing interventions might be more appropriate.21 Numerous findings from studies on the efficacy of school closures showed that the risk of transmission within the educational environment often strongly depends on the incidence of covid-19 in the community, and that school closures are most successfully associated with control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission when other mitigation strategies are in place in the community.111112113114115116117 School closures have been reported to be disruptive to students globally and are likely to impair children\u2019s social, psychological, and educational development118119 and to result in loss of income and productivity in adults who cannot work because of childcare responsibilities.120 Speculation remains as how best to implement physical distancing measures.121 Studies that assess physical distancing measures might interchangeably study physical distancing with lockdown35525664 and other measures and thus direct associations are difficult to assess. Empirical evidence from restricted travel and full border closures is also limited, as it is almost impossible to study these strategies as single measures. Current evidence from a recent narrative literature review suggested that control of movement, along with mandated quarantine, travel restrictions, and restricting nationals from entering areas of high infection, are effective measures, but only with good compliance.122 A narrative literature review of travel bans, partial lockdowns, and quarantine also suggested effectiveness of these measures,123 and another rapid review further supported travel restrictions and cross border restrictions to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2.124 It was impossible to make such observations in the current review because of limited evidence. A German review, however, suggested that entry, exit, and symptom screening measures to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are not effective at detecting a meaningful proportion of cases,125 and another review using real world data from multiple countries found that border closures had minimal impact on the control of covid-19.126 Although universal lockdowns have shown a protective effect in lowering the incidence of covid-19, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and covid-19 mortality, these measures are also disruptive to the psychosocial and mental health of children and adolescents,127 global economies,128 and societies.129 Partial lockdowns could be an alternative, as the associated effectiveness can be high,125 especially when implemented early in an outbreak,85 and such measures would be less disruptive to the general population. It is important to also consider numerous sociopolitical and socioeconomic factors that have been shown to increase SARS-CoV-2 infection130131 and covid-19 mortality.132 Immigration status,82 economic status,81101 and poverty and rurality98 can influence individual and community compliance with public health measures. Poverty can impact the ability of communities to physically distance,133 especially in crowded living environments,134135 as well as reduce access to personal protective measures.134135 A recent study highlights that \u201ca one size fits all\u201d approach to public health measures might not be effective at reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in vulnerable communities136 and could exacerbate social and economic inequalities.135137 As such, a more nuanced and community specific approach might be required. Even though screening is highly recommended by WHO138 because a proportion of patients with covid-19 can be asymptomatic,138 screening for symptoms might miss a larger proportion of the population with covid-19. Hence, temperature screening technologies might need to be reconsidered and evaluated for cost effectiveness, given such measures are largely depended on symptomatic fever cases. Strengths and limitations of this review The main strength of this systematic review was the use of a comprehensive search strategy to identify and select studies for review and thereby minimise selection bias. A clinical epidemiologist developed the search strategy, which was validated by two senior medical librarians. This review followed a comprehensive appraisal process that is recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration31 to assess the effectiveness of public health measures, with specifically validated tools used to independently and individually assess the risk of bias in each study by study design. This review has some limitations. Firstly, high quality evidence on SARS CoV-2 and the effectiveness of public health measures is still limited, with most studies having different underlying target variables. Secondly, information provided in this review is based on current evidence, so will be modified as additional data become available, especially from more prospective and randomised studies. Also, we excluded studies that did not provide certainty over the effect measure, which might have introduced selection bias and limited the interpretation of effectiveness. Thirdly, numerous studies measured interventions only once and others multiple times over short time frames (days v month, or no timeframe). Additionally, the meta-analytical portion of this study was limited by significant heterogeneity observed across studies, which could neither be explored nor explained by subgroup analyses or meta-regression. Finally, we quantitatively assessed only publications that reported individual measures; studies that assessed multiple measures simultaneously were narratively analysed with a broader level of effectiveness (see supplementary material 3, table 3). Also, we excluded studies in languages other than English. Methodological limitations of studies included in the review Several studies failed to define and assess for potential confounders, which made it difficult for our review to draw a one directional or causal conclusion. This problem was mainly because we were unable to study only one intervention, given that many countries implemented several public health measures simultaneously; thus it is a challenge to disentangle the impact of individual interventions (ie, physical distancing when other interventions could be contributing to the effect). Additionally, studies measured different primary outcomes and in varied ways, which limited the ability to statistically analyse other measures and compare effectiveness. Further pragmatic randomised controlled trials and natural experiment studies are needed to better inform the evidence and guide the future implementation of public health measures. Given that most measures depend on a population\u2019s adherence and compliance, it is important to understand and consider how these might be affected by factors. A lack of data in the assessed studies meant it was not possible to understand or determine the level of compliance and adherence to any of the measures.",

        "title":"Why the monkeypox outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concernThe world ignores at its peril pathogens that spread in low income countries, writes Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.bmj.com\/content\/378\/bmj.o1978",
        "text":"Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , Director , General , World Health Organization On 23 July, I declared the global monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) and issued recommendations to all countries, with the objective of stopping transmission and controlling the outbreak. Monkeypox has been known to infect humans for more than 50 years, but until this year, was little known or understood outside Africa, and received scant attention or investment. On 13 May, the United Kingdom reported a case of monkeypox in an individual with recent travel history to Nigeria, one of several African countries where the virus is known to be endemic. Since then, the outbreak has expanded rapidly. At the time of writing, more than 26 000 cases have been reported from 85 countries and territories, with 12 deaths, and the outbreak shows no sign of slowing down. The majority of reported cases\u2014over 97%\u2014are among men who have sex with men (MSM), especially those with multiple sexual partners, underscoring the need for all countries to work closely with affected communities to design and deliver effective information and services, to guard against stigma and discrimination, and to adopt measures that protect their health, human rights, and dignity. In most cases the disease is self-limiting; however, symptoms can be severe and about 10% of cases are admitted to hospital to manage the excruciating pain caused by the disease or secondary infections. Two smallpox vaccines have been approved for use against monkeypox and a third is under consideration. However, data are lacking on the efficacy of these vaccines for monkeypox, and an effective immune response can take several weeks to develop, meaning vaccination will not provide instant protection against infection or disease. WHO is working with manufacturers to accelerate equitable access to vaccines, and with affected countries to generate data on their efficacy. The primary focus for all countries, therefore, must be to stop transmission using effective public health tools, including enhanced disease surveillance, careful contact tracing, tailored risk communication and community engagement, and risk reduction measures. It is also critical to ensure all affected communities have equitable access to other tools needed to stop transmission, including testing, antivirals, and supportive care. Under the International Health Regulations (IHR), the decision to declare a PHEIC rests with the WHO Director-General, taking into consideration the information provided by countries; the risk to human health, international spread, and the potential for interference with international traffic; scientific principles, evidence, and other relevant information; and the advice of the Emergency Committee, a panel of external experts convened by the Director-General to advise her or him on whether the public health event in question constitutes a PHEIC. On this occasion, the Emergency Committee was, for the first time since the IHR entered into force in 2007, unable to reach consensus. The rapid international spread of the virus, the risk of further spread with unknown impact, the potential for the virus to become entrenched in previously unaffected regions, and the fact that the outbreak clearly met the definition of a PHEIC outlined in the IHR, all led me to the decision that the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. A PHEIC is the highest level of alarm under the IHR, and the only one. It\u2019s clear that although the IHR remains a vital tool for controlling the international spread of disease, it is a tool that must be sharpened to make it more effective. In particular, the binary nature of the determination of a PHEIC is too blunt for evaluating the spectrum of risk posed by emergencies of different kinds. Alongside the process of negotiating a new international accord on pandemic preparedness and response, WHO\u2019s Member States are also considering targeted amendments to the IHR, including ways to improve the process for declaring a PHEIC. More importantly, this outbreak is another demonstration that breaking the cycle of \u201cpanic and neglect\u201d that for decades has been the hallmark of the global response to epidemics and pandemics requires a paradigm shift in global health. The world ignores at its peril pathogens that spread \u201conly\u201d in low-income countries; most are one flight away from sparking a global public health emergency. Protecting the health of any population relies ultimately on protecting the health of every population, through stronger public health functions and health systems, based on robust primary health care and a commitment to universal health coverage. Global health security depends on local health security in every country.",

        "text":"Kamran Abbasi , editor in chief The BMJ kabbasi{at}bmj.com Follow Kamran on Twitter @KamranAbbasi With \u201cbiblical\u201d floods affecting tens of millions of people in Pakistan, and a cost of energy crisis that threatens the health and wellbeing of millions of children and elderly people in the UK alone (doi:10.1136\/bmj.o2113),1 there are only four certainties: death, taxes, a worsening climate emergency, and the relentless growth in energy companies\u2019 profits. The link between energy policy and health has never been clearer. A new investigation by The BMJ finds that hospitals in the UK are predicting that they will be forced to cut patients\u2019 services to pay their \u201ceye watering\u201d energy bills this winter (doi:10.1136\/bmj.o2088).2 Inevitably, the commitment of staff will be relied on to keep the health service going, but how much is left in the well of goodwill? Besides workload pressures, NHS consultants remain aggrieved over pay and pensions (doi:10.1136\/bmj.o2073),3 while GPs are losing the sense of \u201cspecialness\u201d that attracted them to primary care (doi:10.1136\/bmj.o2002).4 It may be worth remembering how August 2022 feels, because a politician or a commentator may tell you in a year or two that the NHS and energy crises were figments of our imaginations, that the public or experts panicked and foisted disastrous policies on politicians. That\u2019s exactly the narrative gathering momentum around covid-19, and it is a narrative that dishonestly disregards the unprecedented pressures on staff, services, and patients (https:\/\/www.spectator.co.uk\/article\/the-lockdown-files-rishi-sunak-on-what-we-werent-told).5 It is the very sort of magical thinking that delayed interventions and precautions and that caused each wave of covid deaths and illness to be worse than it needed to be (https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2022\/aug\/25\/the-guardian-view-on-rishi-sunak-a-claim-too-far).6 A public inquiry has begun into why the UK seemed so well prepared yet performed so disastrously (https:\/\/covid19.public-inquiry.uk\/2022\/07\/uk-covid-19-inquiry-launches-first-investigation).7 It is an inquiry that The BMJ, among others, has pushed for since 2020 (doi:10.1136\/bmj.m2052).8 The lessons must be learnt so mistakes are not repeated. One point of controversy is the use and misuse of science to inform policy decisions, and The BMJ has commissioned a series of papers on how science was interpreted and applied in key areas (doi:10.1136\/bmj.o2066).9 Each paper offers take home messages for the inquiry and proposes a set of questions it must explore further if it is to fulfil its mandate. The papers in the series aren\u2019t non-committal. We are not indulging in \u201cboth-sideism\u201d (doi:10.1136\/bmj.o2136),10 although as ever we understand that not everybody will agree and welcome ongoing debate through our rapid responses on bmj.com and our letters pages. The papers\u2019 authors take a position and substantiate it. The first two papers focus on airborne transmission and on children and schools. Trisha Greenhalgh and colleagues are unequivocal that the flawed narrative that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was by droplets rather than by being airborne resulted in avoidable infections and deaths\u2014and still causes harm today (doi:10.1136\/bmj-2022-069940).11 Deepti Gurdasani and colleagues argue that UK pandemic policy for schools and children was an international outlier, downplayed the importance of precautionary measures, and accelerated community transmission (doi:10.1136\/bmj-2022-071234).12 The verdict of The BMJ\u2019s covid inquiry papers is clear: scientists, health workers on the front line, and the public were let down by politicians. They were \u201clions led by donkeys.\u201d What\u2019s true of the UK will resonate in many other countries. The job of the UK\u2019s inquiry is to find out why this happened and to prevent it happening again. In the meantime, with the prospect of a catastrophic winter ahead, amid dire warnings of a humanitarian crisis from the NHS Confederation and Michael Marmot, to name but two (doi:10.1136\/bmj.o2113, doi:10.1136\/bmj.o2088, doi:10.1136\/bmj.o2129),1213 the sense that the politicians of the day and their supporters haven\u2019t grasped the depth of crisis we are facing\u2014or that if they do grasp it they have chosen not to help the people most in need\u2014means that the public and health workers must be ready to be failed again.

        "text":"Martin McKee , professor of European public health 1, Kara Hanson , professor of health system economics 1, Kamran Abbasi , editor in chief 2 1London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK 2The BMJ, London UK Correspondence to: K Abbasi kabbasi{at}bmj.com A BMJ series examines how politicians used, and failed to use, evidence in response to the pandemic As we await the completion of the UK\u2019s covid-19 inquiry, chaired by Heather Hallett,1 we will need patience and realistic expectations. Public inquiries in the UK tend to be slow to conclude and even slower to lead to change. The Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war took seven years.2 The Saville inquiry into events on Bloody Sunday in Northern Ireland took 10.3 The outgoing prime minister, Boris Johnson, has dallied and delayed over a covid inquiry, and it took a threat of judicial review by representatives of bereaved families to get the government to finally publish the inquiry\u2019s terms of reference.4 Those terms of reference, which were subject to extensive consultation, are wide ranging.5 The inquiry has two aims, to provide a factual narrative account of what happened and to identify lessons that can inform the response to future pandemics. It will cover the public health response, including preparedness, use of data, decision making, and the effect of the pandemic across society; the health and care sector response, including social care and procurement; and the economic response, such as the furlough scheme. The inquiry will document what decisions were made but also how and why they were made. It will pay particular attention to \u201cdisparities,\u201d a word favoured by a government that is unwilling to speak of inequalities.6 It will consider the experiences of bereaved families and pay regard to international comparisons\u2014two areas that the government was criticised for neglecting.7 None of this will be easy. One challenge will be getting at the truth, given the government\u2019s track record of rejecting requests under the Freedom of Information Act,8 refusals by ministers to attend parliamentary committees,9 and Johnson\u2019s habit of not answering the questions put to him in parliament each week. This is a government that is uncomfortable with scrutiny. For example, it is thanks primarily to a series of judicial reviews launched by the Good Law Project that we know about the widespread abuses in procurement of essential equipment during the pandemic.10 In these circumstances, Hallett\u2019s warning that she will \u201cnot tolerate any attempt to mislead the inquiry, to undermine its integrity or its independence\u201d seems understandable.11 Another challenge will be assessing how the decision making process was informed and influenced. Throughout the pandemic politicians and their scientific advisers insisted that decision making would be \u201cguided by the science.\u201d However, evidence is socially constructed and can be highly contested.12 Different sources, and indeed types, of evidence are given different weight in developing policy: it is important to consider whose science counts, and why. To be useful in informing responses to future pandemics, the inquiry must come to a view about how the scientific evidence figured in decision making, and how approaches to bridging the evidence-to-policy boundary could have been more effective.13 Our analysis To help the inquiry in these areas, The BMJ has commissioned a series of articles examining how evidence was used to shape the response to the covid-19 pandemic in the UK (www.bmj.com\/covid-inquiry). We also explore how information was misused, abused, and manipulated to feed an ideologically driven \u201cinfodemic\u201d with global consequences for vaccine hesitancy and resistance to non-pharmaceutical interventions. The articles in the series describe successes and failures. The successes include the vaccine programme, at least in its early stages, and the response of the NHS in delivering the vaccine rollout, creating clinical learning networks, and in health service innovation. The Recovery trial,14 the OpenSafely data resource,15 and COG-UK, which provided genomic sequencing and some of the modelling, were world leading. In all of these, to some degree, the ability to generate evidence quickly drew on existing research platforms that had benefited from earlier public investment in medical and public health research. But many mistakes were made. This is forgivable when dealing with a new virus, but what is unforgivable is that they were not corrected as knowledge and experience accumulated. The pandemic response may become a case study for students of cognitive bias. The evidence that SARS-CoV-2 transmits through the air, in crowded and poorly ventilated places, was clear relatively early on. Even now, many policies ignore this vital fact. Children have been harmed through covid affecting them or family members, and through loss of education.16 The measures that would protect them, such as vaccination and improved ventilation in schools, attract lukewarm support at best. Those unlearnt lessons are also evident in how modelling was used to inform public policy,17 in implementation of covid-19 vaccination, in knowledge mobilisation and getting evidence into practice,1819 and in the role and positioning of science advice in policy making.20 Our conclusion is clear: with the toll approaching 200 000 excess deaths the UK\u2019s response should have been much better. In 2019, it had come second in the world in an index of pandemic preparedness.21 While debate continues about how best to compare the resilience of national health systems to shocks such as pandemics, there is little doubt that the UK\u2019s response fell far short of its potential. The effect of that mismanagement continues to be felt in the ongoing pressures on the workforce and patients in health and social care. The question is why? And that is the central question that the UK\u2019s covid-19 inquiry must answer. Each article in our series, which will continue over the next few weeks, offers a set of messages that we hope will inform the inquiry, as well as a list of questions that demand answers. But one message is universal and unequivocal: scientists and health workers on the front line of the response, and therefore the public, were too often let down by politicians. True to a phrase first used to describe British infantrymen in the first world war, scientists and health workers during the covid-19 pandemic of 2020-21 were \u201clions led by donkeys.\u201d Footnotes Competing interests: We have read and understood BMJ policy on declaration of interests and declare that MM is a member of Independent SAGE and president of the BMA but writes in a personal capacity.

        "link":"https:\/\/bmjmedicine.bmj.com\/content\/1\/1\/e000040",
        "text":"Introduction Seven coronaviruses can infect humans, all belonging to the alpha or beta subgroups, including 229E (alpha), NL63 (alpha), OC43 (beta), and HKU1 (beta).1 Over the past two decades, three notable beta coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2011; and most recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019) have emerged and caused severe illness, resulting in debilitating disease and worldwide deaths. SARS-CoV-2 is the pathogen responsible for the current coronavirus 2019 (covid-19) pandemic and has caused more than 5.59 million deaths in around two years and resulted in multisystem illness in several million people.2 All viruses change and mutate over time, with most changes having little to no impact. However, some mutations could alter its pathogenic or transmission potential and might, therefore, increase disease severity or hinder the effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutic strategies. The World Health Organization3 classifies variants of concern as SARS-CoV-2 variants that increase transmissibility, disease severity, or virulence or that decrease the effectiveness of public health measures, diagnostics, therapeutics, or vaccines. Variants of interest are variants with genetic changes predicted to enhance the virulence and transmissibility of the virus, which have been identified to cause community transmission in multiple countries and pose a possible risk to global public health. Lastly, variants under monitoring are those with genetic changes are suspected to affect virus characteristics and have currently unclear phenotypic or epidemiological effects. Variants under monitoring are not typically assigned a name until they are upgraded to variants of interest or concern. The full working definitions of variants of concern, variants of interest, and variants under monitoring can be found on the WHO website for tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants (www.who.int\/en\/activities\/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants\/).3 As of 25 January 2022, WHO reports five variants of concern (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and omicron), two variants of interest (lambda and mu), and three variants under monitoring.3 Former variants of concern, variants of interest, or variants under monitoring have been reclassified as \"formerly monitored variants,\" owing to these variants no longer circulating, having little impact on the epidemiological situation, or having no concerning properties.3 Since the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic, the rapid development of effective covid-19 vaccines has taken place around the world. As of 24 January 2022, 33 vaccines have been approved for use in 197 countries, with 10 vaccines having gained emergency use listing approval from WHO.4 In this review, we provide an overview of the genome and structure of SARS-CoV-2, describing how these elements allow the virus to infect and replicate inside of host cells, before outlining how certain mutations harboured by SARS-CoV-2 variants enhance these abilities. Next, we examine the current state of vaccine development around the world and provide evidence of the effectiveness of booster doses. Sources and selection criteria We searched PubMed and Embase databases for covid-19 related articles published between 1 January 2020 and 25 January 2022 and for general coronavirus related articles published from 1 January 2000 onwards. Our search terms included SARS-CoV-2, covid-19, and specific terms including virology, genome, variants, and vaccine. Additional, specific search terms are outlined in online supplemental file 1. We performed further manual searching for additional articles and data using relevant databases, including who.int, gov.uk, and ecdc.europa.eu\/en. Owing to the rapidly evolving nature of the literature involving SARS-CoV-2, we also searched preprint databases including MedRxiv and BioRxiv. We selected studies through different criteria (online supplemental file 1), owing to the various topics discussed here. Overall, studies were selected on the basis of quality and impact factor of publishing journal, with real world studies with large sample sizes of the greatest interest. Supplemental material [bmjmed-2021-000040supp001.pdf] Viral transmission, clinical presentation, and genetic susceptibility of covid-19 SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly spread via respiratory droplet transmission, spreading between people through close contact, coughing, or sneezing. The virus can also spread through airborne transmission, fomite transmission, and via other modes, such as through biological material including urine and faeces.5 6 The SARS-CoV-2 virus can survive on surfaces or survive suspended in air droplets for long periods. Indeed, on plastic, stainless steel, and glass surfaces, the half life of the virus is around 5.3, 4.4, and 4.2 hours, respectively,7 with no difference seen between SARS-CoV-2 variants.8 Although SARS-CoV-2 can be detected on inanimate surfaces for hours and days, owing to the evaporation of water droplets (the viruses\u2019 living environment), the concentration of the virus plummets rapidly.9 Protective measures, including use of personal protective equipment, maintenance of indoor ventilation, and disinfection hands and surfaces, can effectively limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2.10 Once inside the airways, SARS-CoV-2 can infect ciliated, mucus secreting, and club cells of bronchial epithelium, type 1 pneumocytes within the lungs, and the conjunctival mucosa.11 The clinical presentation of covid-19 is non-specific and heterogeneous, and infection can result in a wide spectrum of symptoms. After an incubation period of 4-14 days, symptoms range from mild to severe disease and, in some instances, can result in death.12 The most common covid-19 symptoms include fever, cough, dyspnoea, and fatigue,13 14 while myalgia, gastrointestinal issues, cognitive deficits, and other symptoms are reported. Asymptomatic individuals can also test positive for covid-19.15 16 Although the entire population is susceptible to covid-19 infection, some subgroups within the general population are more susceptible to developing poorer clinical outcomes. Risk factors associated with increased probability of hospital admission, severe disease, and fatal outcome with covid-19 have been identified. Older age17\u201319; male sex20 21; belonging to an ethnic minority group21 22; and comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, and lung disease,18 23\u201325 malignancy, and immunodeficiency26\u201328 have all been associated with more severe covid-19. The duration and treatment of covid-19 symptoms will also have profound influences on the severity of disease and the acute and long term outcomes after recovery. The host genetic background is thought to have an influence on the susceptibility and severity of covid-19, possibly explaining the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations that can develop in seemingly similar individuals. A meta-analysis, consisting of 49,562 patients with covid-19 across numerous ancestry groups, identified four gene loci associated with susceptibility to covid-19 (SLC6A20, RPL24, ABO, PLEKHA4) and nine associated with increased risk of severe covid-19 (LZTFL1, FOXP4, TMEM65, OAS1, KANSL1, TAC4, DPP9, RAVER1, and IFNAR2).29 Meanwhile, genome wide association studies spanning across Europe, the US, and the UK identified a gene cluster on chromosome three (chr3p21.31) as being strongly linked with susceptibility and severity of covid-19.30 31 Polymorphisms in the genes of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) have also been shown to enhance SARS-CoV-2 viral entry,32 33 with differential polymorphisms seen across ethnic minority populations, which might partly explain why certain ethnic groups are more susceptible to severe covid-19. Increased ACE2 receptor levels have also been associated with other risk factors of covid-19, including smoking and increasing age.34 The use of polygenetic risk scores might be useful in determining an individual\u2019s risk for developing severe disease caused by covid-19.35 A polygenetic risk score infers a person\u2019s risk of susceptibility to, or development of, a certain disease based on the total number of genomic variations they possess. Determining polygenetic risk scores with the inclusion of comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,36 or other aspects such as coagulation factors,37 could improve the usefulness of these scores in determining a person\u2019s risk of severe covid-19. Virology of SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV-2 is a positive stranded RNA virus belonging to Coronaviridae family. Coronaviruses, which have crown-like appearances, are the largest known RNA viruses and are thought to primarily infect vertebrates.38 39 SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta genus of the coronaviruses and has a genome size varying from 29.8 to 29.9 kb.40 Human coronavirus genomes consist of a variable number of open reading frames (ORFs). Following the typical 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 order, the beginning two thirds of the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains two ORFs (ORF1a and ORF1b) that, inside the host cell, are translated at the rough endoplasmic reticulum into polyprotein 1a (pp1a) and polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab), respectively.40 These polyproteins are cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp): nsp1-11, from pp1a; and nsp12-16, from pp1ab. The proteolytic release of nsp1 occurs rapidly, which enables it to interfere with translation processes of the host cell by inducing cellular mRNA degradation.41\u201343 Nsp2-16 contain the viruses\u2019 replication and transcription complex and encode multiple enzymes with many functions, including proteases, helicase, polymerase, exonuclease and endonuclease, N7-methyltransferase and 2\u2019O-methyltransferase, and de-ubiquitination enzymes.44 45 The final third of human coronavirus genomes contain genes that encode structural and accessory proteins. The four major structural proteins encoded here are the nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelope (E), and spike glycoprotein (S) proteins.46 47 The N protein is associated with the viral RNA genome, is involved in RNA synthesis regulation, and interacts with the M protein during viral budding.39 48 The M protein is important for viral assembly, it contains a short N-terminal domain that projects onto the external surface of the envelope and a long internal C-terminal.39 The E protein function is largely unknown; however, along with the N and M proteins, it is required for viral assembly and release.47 Lastly, the S protein gives coronaviruses their characteristic spikes that compose their crownlike appearance. This protein projects through the viral envelope, is heavily glycosylated, and regulates host cell membrane receptor binding and fusion of the viral and cellular membrane.49 The functions of the 11 accessory proteins encoded within the one-third closest to the 3\u2019 end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome are not fully understood. These accessory proteins are encoded by the ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF3c, ORF3d, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF9b, ORC9c, and ORF10 genes. Some of these proteins, including ORF3b, ORF6, ORF7a, and ORF8, are interferon antagonists that impair the host cell immune response,50\u201353 whereas ORF3a might promote virus release54 and is involved in apoptosis of host cells through caspase-3 activation.55 ORF9b and ORF9c are known to suppress the host antiviral response by interacting with host cell organelles,56\u201358 whereas a clear understanding of the functions of ORF3c, ORF7b, and ORF10 remains unclear.59 Figure 1 (A,B) depicts the genome and structure of SARS-CoV-2. Figure 1 Genome and structure of SARS-CoV-2. (A) SARS-CoV-2 genome and spike (S) protein amino acid composition. The SARS-CoV-2 genome is about 30 000 base pairs (bp) long and consists of open reading frames (ORF) and elements that are essential for the virus\u2019 structure. The S protein is responsible for binding and entry into host cells. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern contain various S protein non-synonymous mutations that result in amino acid changes in the receptor binding domain (orange bracketed text) and the S1\/S2 subunit interface (black bracketed text), which have been shown to enhance transmissibility of the virus. Variants of concern include alpha (\u03b1), beta (\u03b2), gamma (\u03b3), delta (\u03b4), and omicron (O). (B) SARS-CoV-2 structure. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that has a crown-like appearance and contains four major structural proteins: nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M). (C) Viral S protein and human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein directly interacts with human ACE2 receptors in order to gain entry into host cells. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein tightly binds to ACE2. (D) S protein structure. The S protein protrudes out from the main SARS-CoV-2 bulk and is comprised of two subunits: S1 and S2. S1 contains the RBD, which directly interacts with the human ACE2 receptor, while the S1\/S2 interface contains a furin cleavage site that is cleaved to allow S2 to fuse with the host cell membrane. Both the RBD and the S1\/S2 interface contain transmissibility increasing mutations that are harboured in variants of concern The S glycoprotein is composed of two functionally distinct subunits (S1 and S2) and is essential for viral entry into host cells. The N-terminal S1 domain of the protein contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) that directly interacts with the ACE2 receptor on the host cell, which is the primary receptor that SARS-Cov-2 uses for cell entry.60 The C-terminal S2 domain fuses the host and viral membranes to allow for entry of the viral genome into the host cell.61 The subunits of the trimeric S complex are either in a closed (pre-fusion stage) or open (post-fusion stage) conformation,62 with one subunit always in an open conformation to allow for ACE2 recognition and binding.63 The RBD itself consists of five anti-parallel \u03b2 strands surrounded by several \u03b1 helices.64 From closed to open conformation, the RBD undergoes structural rearrangement whereby the globular head region rotates clockwise, which alters is elecropotential surface.64 Once positioned, numerous residues within the RBD form either hydrogen bonds or salt bridges with residues of the ACE2 receptor, allowing for tight binding,65 while the concave structure of the RBD allows for three distinct binding regions.64 Following binding between the S protein and the host cell receptor, host cell proteases cleave the S protein, causing the release of the S2 domain which allows for fusion and cell entry.66 Figure 1 (C,D) shows the structure and function of the S protein. The ACE2 receptor is expressed in numerous cell types throughout the human body, including in the lungs, oral and nasal mucosas, heart, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, liver, spleen, and brain,67 highlighting the widespread infection that SARS-CoV-2 can inflict. Meanwhile, TMPRSS2, a host cell protease, facilitates fusion of the viral and host cell membranes,68 and could have a role in the spread of the virus in the airways.68 Host cell cathepsin L might also aid in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry by cleaving the S protein.69 Indeed, a clinically approved protease inhibitor has been shown to block SARS-CoV-2 cell entry.70 Figure 2 depicts the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into and replicates inside host cells, and summarises the host cell immune response. Figure 2 Viral entry and host response. (A) At the alveolar epithelial cell layer. Epithelial cells in the lungs express both angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), allowing for infection by SARS-CoV-2. Replication of the virus within these cells induces an intense immune response that attracts monocytes, T cells, and macrophages and, in some instances, can result in a cytokine storm. (B) Within nearby blood vessels. Cytokines produced by the epithelial cell layer are released into blood vessels supplying the infected tissue, which causes the recruitment of further immune cells to the area, driving the damaging inflammatory response further. Circulating cytokines also create a systemic inflammatory environment. (C) Adaptive immune response. Circulating lymphocytes carry viral antigens to lymph nodes and bone marrow to begin the adaptive immune system processes whereby B cells, and later antibodies, are activated. (D) SARS-CoV2 host replication. The SARS-CoV-2 virus uses the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 to gain entry into human cells. Following release of the viral RNA within the host cell, the virus uses the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus to produce and manufacture new viral particles, which are released out of the cell to infect other cells and new hosts Emerging treatments As the virus becomes better understood, the therapeutic strategy against covid-19 develops. Over 2000 ongoing trials are currently assessing certain treatment strategies for covid-19.309 Recently, antiviraldrugs including molnupiravir (Lagevrio) and nirmatrelvir\/ritonavir (Paxlovid) have been approved in the UK,310 311 US,312 313 and Europe314 315 for treating covid-19 in certain risk groups. Similarly, sotrovimab (Xevudy), a monoclonal antibody treatment, has recently been approved for use in treating certain patients with covid-19 in the UK,316 US,317 and Europe.318 These drugs have been shown to be effective at preventing poor clinical outcomes, including death, in those individuals vulnerable to severe covid-19 infection. Other drug treatments, such as janus kinase inhibitors, corticosteroids, and anti-inflammatory drugs, have contrasting evidence to support their use; therefore, the use of specific drugs is either recommended for or against by certain treatment and management guidelines, which are discussed below. Guidelines The treatment and management of covid-19 is a continually evolving topic; however, health authorities have published and continue to update guidelines and recommendations for treating covid-19. The WHO living guideline on covid-19 and treatment is regularly updated, with the latest version (published on 14 January 2022) containing 14 recommendations on covid-19 treatment.319 The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence320 and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency321 provide updated guidelines on covid-19 treatment, and in Europe, the ECDC regularly publishes several guidelines providing recommendations on a range of covid-19 related topics.322 The US National Institutes of Health323 and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention324 provide guidance on covid-19 treatment and management, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention supplying guidelines for specific groups such as employers, schools, health departments, and governments. Considerations for the future Novel infectious diseases and pandemics are an unpredictable but inevitable aspect of nature; therefore, we should learn from past pandemics to prepare for future ones. Firstly, the covid-19 pandemic has highlighted and amplified the existing inequalities within society,325 with Black ethnicity, social disadvantage, and unemployment being risk factors for covid-19 infection326 and those groups most economically deprived found to be particularly vulnerable.327 These inequalities need resolving in order for us to be better prepared for similar situations in the future. Next, to progress through a pandemic we should be racing against the pathogen, and not against each other. This statement becomes apparent when considering the problems faced by countries seeking out personal protective equipment,328 and the vaccine inequity seen worldwide,329 with developed countries often better placed to be able to purchase these items. Initiatives such as WHO\u2019s COVAX programme are vital to protect the most vulnerable groups and reduce the global spread of disease. In October 2021, the UK government released a publication outlining where the policies implemented to reduce the impact of the covid-19 pandemic failed, and the lessons learnt from these failures.330 The publication then presents conclusions and recommendations on how to enhance pandemic preparedness, lockdown and social distancing measures, testing and contact tracing, social care, and vaccines. In countries such as the UK, US, and much of Europe, where the covid-19 death rate has been high, steps need to be taken and lessons need to be learnt in order to be better prepared for the next pandemic. The responsibility of improving pandemic response lies with policy makers, the medical\/scientific community, and the public, and will ultimately require a collaborative approach. However, certain aspects of the response to the covid-19 pandemic have been a triumph. One major victory was the rapid development and rollout of vaccines,331 which continue to be effective. The rollout of rapid testing and quarantine for infected individuals was also important to at least disrupt the spread of the virus, especially given that asymptomatic individuals can contribute to the spread. Furthermore, the swift identification and sharing of knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 variants between countries should be applauded. Lessons can be learnt from countries where covid-19 was controlled. In Taiwan, authorities managing the pandemic as directed by pre-covid-19 pandemic plans prompted an immediate response. Screening of all airline passengers arriving from Wuhan and high risk areas, restricting entry for non-Taiwanese citizens, 14 day quarantine periods for contacts of people with confirmed covid-19 or returning travellers, a ban on large gatherings, and widespread mask wearing were some of the quickly implemented management strategies.332 New Zealand implemented similarly effective restrictions, with the addition of a national lockdown.332 Many of the pandemic control components that kept infection and death numbers low in Taiwan and New Zealand could be adopted by other countries in the future and could lead to improved outcomes in terms of protecting the health of individuals and the health and wellbeing of the country. Overall, much can be learnt from the covid-19 pandemic and, as we emerge from it, the inspection of which policies failed and which succeeded is imperative. Conclusion Covid-19 remains prevalent and life threatening. Although the rollout of vaccines has been successful, attaining a high global vaccination coverage and ensuring that all healthcare systems have the capacity to cope with seasonal waves are essential. With the omicron variant highly prevalent, we must continue to learn, develop therapeutics, and remain vigilant to new variants of concern. Here, we have provided an overview of the virology of SARS-CoV-2, including the mutations harboured by variants of the virus and how these mutations effect its transmissibility and virulence. We have also discussed the vaccines that have been developed and used around the world and have provided evidence supporting the rollout of booster doses. Future priorities should focus on continuing vaccination programmes and developing variant specific vaccines as new mutations emerge. This strategy, along with the expansion of our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and which treatments are most successful to treat covid-19 infections will ultimately lead to favourable outcomes. Questions for future research How will the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutate in the future, and which mutations will give a competitive advantage that will allow the virus to inflict disease to many people? How do we keep up with the rapidly changing SARS-CoV-2 environment and ensure that vaccines remain effective? How do we manage the booster programme and when will future booster vaccinations be required in order to maintain high levels of immunity? How can we learn from the current and past pandemics so that we are better prepared for the next one?

        "text":"Helen Clark , Partnership for Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health (PMNCH) board chair , Michelle Bachelet , United Nations high commissioner for human rights , Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares , minister of foreign affairs, Spain We are faced with a global plague of sexual and gender based violence and urgently need targeted interventions, say Helen Clark, Michelle Bachelet, and Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares Rape is being used in conflict as a deliberate military strategy and is feared most by women and girls as soon as the shooting starts. They are right to be afraid. Rape and other forms of sexual and gender based violence have become shockingly common in humanitarian settings worldwide. Conflict related sexual violence is on the rise globally\u2014in a report of the United Nations secretary general to the UN Security Council, 49 global parties were noted as being credibly suspected of committing or being responsible for patterns of rape or other forms of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict in 2021.1 The testimony of a woman from Central Equatoria in South Sudan is unfortunately all too familiar. Attacked by soldiers in her own home, she told how, \u201cAfter one man bit me, another pointed the gun directly on my chest and said if I don\u2019t accept them then he will kill me.\u201d2 As this human right violation unfolded, the woman\u2019s children were nearby. Sexual and gender based violence flourishes whenever armed conflict occurs, because fear, chaos, and confusion provide perfect cover for the perpetrators. Conflicts exacerbate gender inequalities that disproportionately affect women and girls worldwide, and worsen the levels of violence to which they are subjected. The breakdown of social norms, legal restraints, and common protections gives armed men the opportunity to target vulnerable women, children, and adolescents. Often this is an intentional tactic designed to terrorise the population. Conflicts and natural disasters break up families, displace women, children, and adolescents, and force them into refugee camps and other unsafe settings where they are cut off from their communities, social structures, and networks of support, and from health and social services. In these settings, women and girls are far more likely to experience gender based violence and are extremely vulnerable to physical, sexual, and psychological harm.3 For instance, violence against women and girls accounted for 97% of conflict related sexual violence cases reported in 2021.4 Migrant women, children, and adolescents also face an increased risk of sexual violence given the lack of safe and regular migration pathways. This is exacerbated by inadequate access to services and information, including on rights, as well as language barriers and limited or no access to decent work and educational opportunities. An assessment among migrants and refugees in the Colombia-Venezuela border ranked care management and prevention of sexual and gender based violence as one of the top 10 unmet needs in sexual and reproductive health.5 A review of 19 studies across 14 countries estimated that about 21% of displaced women experienced sexual violence.6 The true figure, however, is likely much higher, as recording of incidents is patchy and women are often afraid to speak out from fear of social stigma. In desperate circumstances, women and girls may be forced to trade sex for food, money, and other resources they need to survive. Up to a third of girls living in a humanitarian setting report that their first sexual encounter was forced.7 Multiple drivers of violence But conflict alone is not the only driver of sexual and gender based violence. Health emergencies, notably covid-19, and natural disasters, including those caused by extreme climate events, are also major factors. Before the pandemic, one in three women worldwide experienced physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner.8 In 2021, a rapid review undertaken by UN Women in four countries found that more than half of women surveyed reported that they or a woman they know experienced physical violence and verbal abuse since the onset of covid-19.9 Covid-19 has also disrupted essential health services and diverted resources to the pandemic response. Long standing barriers to reporting and accessing services, such as stigma, fear of retaliation, and weak rule of law institutions have been exacerbated by the ongoing pandemic.10 Additionally, movement restrictions due to covid-19 continued to prevent survivors of sexual violence from accessing essential services. Climate change and natural disasters cause poverty, displacement, conflict, and loss of access to education.11 They lead indirectly to an increase in child marriage, which is recognised in international law as a form of gender based violence. Tragically, child marriage is just one outrage on a long list. During 2018, the UN verified more than 24 000 grave violations against children and adolescents in 20 countries, including recruitment of child soldiers, killing or maiming, and sexual assault or abduction.6 The tools to end this plague These atrocities will not go away of their own accord. We urgently need targeted action and interventions to prevent and respond to sexual and gender based violence, particularly in humanitarian and fragile settings in full respect of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. Survivors require targeted sexual and reproductive health services and social care, and need to participate in relevant decision making. Yet, as evidence shows, such care and services are often unavailable or inaccessible.12 They also need justice and accountability for perpetrators. Yet most of these crimes go unpunished, those responsible are not held accountable, and survivors are left without reparations and remedies. At the global level, there is a need for concerted multilateral efforts to accelerate action to tackle sexual and gender based violence and to strengthen international collaboration for comprehensive sexual reproductive health and rights for all individuals, including prevention of sexual and gender based violence. We must also ensure gender responsive and age sensitive reparations for all survivors, in line with international human rights and international humanitarian law. At the national level, countries need to establish enabling and protective frameworks and focus resources to protect the physical and mental health of refugees and others at risk of personal violence and displacement because of conflict. Measures should be embedded within a comprehensive agenda for sexual and reproductive health and rights that protects access to sexual and reproductive health services in all settings, including in humanitarian responses. Measures to promote accountability, ensure access to justice and reparation for survivors, and tackle the impunity of perpetrators are also necessary. Countries should earmark long term investments and social protection schemes to mainstream this agenda throughout emergency humanitarian responses and in programming across all sectors. This includes investments in capacity strengthening, monitoring, and data analysis, and essential training of healthcare workers and other relevant sectors, including justice and education, as well as providing an enabling and safe environment in which they can work.13 We are faced with a global plague of sexual and gender based violence. It feeds off the lawless chaos of conflict, the unprecedented disruption of covid-19, and the growing destruction wrought by climate change. The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women has guidance on the gender related dimensions of disaster risk reduction in the context of climate change and on women in conflict prevention, conflict, and post-conflict situations.1415 We have the tools to end this plague, but it will require an integrated partnership approach at all levels. Our actions must be guided by key human rights principles\u2014equality and non-discrimination, participation and empowerment, accountability, and access to justice. No single input will work on its own, so every sector and stakeholder must contribute to stamp out sexual and gender based violence in conflict and humanitarian settings.

        "text":"The draft terms of reference for the UK covid-19 inquiry encompass not just what decisions were made but also how and why.1 As Dyani Lewis has argued in Nature, the World Health Organization overlooked\u2014and at times explicitly denied\u2014airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 for over two years, despite early evidence indicating that this was an important, and perhaps the dominant, route of transmission.2 UK policy makers likewise adhered to an assumed droplet mode of transmission and prioritised interventions accordingly, neglecting the key topic of indoor air quality.3 We consider how flawed narratives about SARS-CoV-2 transmission arose and became entrenched, leading to misplaced policies and avoidable deaths, focusing mainly on the UK. We invite the inquiry to consider not just those specific flawed decisions but also the culture of premature scientific conclusions and reluctance to engage with uncertainty. If an infectious pathogen is mainly airborne, a person could be infected by inhaling aerosols emitted in the breath of an infected person. These aerosols might remain suspended in the air for many hours. Reducing airborne transmission requires measures to avoid inhalation of infectious aerosols, including: These contact, droplet, and fomite precautions do not distinguish between indoor and outdoor settings, because a gravity driven mechanism for transmission would operate similarly in both. Getting the mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission right matters, because preventive strategies follow ( box 1 ). 5 6 Being honest about scientific uncertainty also matters, because\u2014among other reasons\u2014it is hard to backtrack after declaring a policy to be \u201cevidence based.\u201d 7 Policy making involves competing narratives (about problems, how they arose, and how they will be resolved), institutions (especially government and its bureaucratic machinery), and interests (financial, political, ideological). 4 Policy might ideally \u201cfollow science,\u201d but whose science and why? Science shapes policy narratives through an \u201cinside track\u201d (such as official advisory committees) and, to a lesser extent, through an \u201coutside track\u201d (such as less mainstream scientists and citizen movements). 4 Pandemic policy making has been characterised not by clearly identified knowledge gaps that science obligingly fills but by toxic clashes between competing scientific and moral narratives. These findings raise some paradigm challenging questions. Should respirator grade protection be worn by everyone\u2014including other patients\u2014whenever patients are coughing? Should more attention be paid to measures higher up the hierarchy of controls, such as ventilation or filtration of air or ensuring that fewer people share air and for shorter periods? A systematic review found wide disagreement among guideline panels about which procedures and activities should count as aerosol generating (and hence earn respirator grade protection for the person doing them). 41 Many procedures, such as taking a nasopharyngeal swab, were inconsistently classified; some acts, such as coughing, were not procedures; and several procedures were classified as aerosol generating only because they induced coughing. 41 A review of the physiology and aerodynamics of respiratory acts concluded that coughing, sneezing, breathing (especially if laboured), speaking, and singing generated substantial amounts of aerosol and that well documented superspreading events for covid-19 involved a critical triad of poor ventilation, crowding, and loud vocalisation. 42 Some parts of WHO subsequently welcomed the input of aerosol scientists and changed the guidance in December 2021 to recommend higher grade personal protective equipment (including N95 respirators) for all covid-19 patient care. 40 But the expert group dissented from this overall view, as noted in a footnote (page 1): \u201cWHO provides this interim recommendation independent of the covid-19 infection prevention and control guidelines development group.\u201d That group continued to promote the \u201csituationally airborne\u201d narrative, which has persisted despite evidence against it and has far reaching implications. If aerosols transmit only when certain procedures are being performed, only a small fraction of healthcare staff need higher grade protection and only when performing particular procedures. If that assumption is incorrect, staff (especially non-medical and less senior ones) and patients in most healthcare facilities are under protected. From the outset, WHO\u2019s guidance on protecting healthcare workers from covid-19 recommended a standard level of protection for most activities but a higher level for \u201caerosol generating\u201d ones, 38 reflecting a long established (but flawed) medical research tradition. WHO\u2019s Infection Prevention and Control Research and Development Expert Group for Covid-19 did not initially include any aerosol scientists and seemed to ignore the offer of help. A new scientific brief was quickly published, reiterating the dominance of droplet transmission in most circumstances but acknowledging airborne transmission in certain situations\u2014aerosol generating medical procedures and crowded, poorly ventilated indoor settings. 39 Countries such as Japan, 14 where \u201cinside track\u201d aerosol scientists had the ear of government, 11 introduced airborne precautions early in the pandemic ( box 2 ). But in most western countries the aerosol narrative initially fell on deaf policy ears. By July 2020, aerosol scientists were alarmed that official advice was based on oversimplistic and incorrect models of transmission (which had perpetuated for decades in the infection control literature 37 ) and wrote an open letter to WHO offering to help. 5 Although SARS-CoV-2 is difficult to isolate from air, viable SARS-CoV-2 was detected early in the pandemic in real world settings where infected people had been 26 27 28 Since early 2020, evidence has accumulated from a range of study designs to support the hypothesis that, like most other respiratory pathogens and perhaps more so than other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through the air ( box 3 ). 5 34 35 36 Aerosol scientists study how fluids and particles travel in the air. Some specialise in how respiratory pathogens\u2014including tuberculosis, influenza, and other coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS\u2014travel. They have shown, using laboratory studies, real world case studies, and computer modelling, that these pathogens are transmitted by aerosols and require airborne mitigation measures ( box 1 ) and that coughs and sneezes generate turbulent gas clouds of different sized particles that can travel long distances. 19 The droplet-but-not-airborne narrative emphasised randomised controlled trials (see supplementary file on bmj.com), 16 drawing implicitly on the hierarchy of evidence\u2014a formalisation of the assumed superiority of randomised trials, which \u201ctypically serve[s] the needs and realities of clinical medicine, but not necessarily public policy.\u201d 17 It did not acknowledge the hierarchy of controls\u2014a public health framework incorporating system level interventions to eliminate pathogens, environmental controls aimed at making air and water safe, and behavioural interventions. 18 This mindset seems to have led policy makers to reject a wealth of evidence on the science of how to optimise indoor air quality. 6 \u201cThe locations where mass infections were confirmed so far are places where the following three conditions were met simultaneously: closed space with poor ventilation, crowded with many people, and conversations and vocalisation in close proximity (within arm\u2019s reach of one another). It is believed that more people were infected in such places. Therefore, we ask that you predict locations and settings where these three conditions could occur simultaneously and avoid them. We do not have enough scientific evidence yet on how significantly such actions can reduce the risk of spreading infection. However, since places with poor ventilation and crowded places are increasing infections, we ask that you take precautions even before scientific evidence for clear standards is found.\u201d washing your hands more often\u2014with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use a hand sanitiser when you get home or into work, when you blow your nose, sneeze or cough, eat or handle food The UK government\u2019s narrative ( box 2 ) was similar to WHO\u2019s. It did not reflect nuanced discussions in the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (SAGE), some members of which had raised the possibility of other transmission routes on 18 February 2020. 15 Rather, it reflected advice from a small group of infection prevention and control experts from Public Health England, Public Health Wales, NHS Scotland, and Public Health Agency Northern Ireland (see supplementary file on bmj.com) who favoured a droplet-but-not-airborne narrative. WHO\u2019s early public information campaign promoted droplet measures\u2014handwashing, respiratory hygiene, and disinfection of surfaces and objects ( box 1 )\u2014and firmly reassured the public that the virus was not airborne ( fig 1 ). This stance reflected the dominance of infection prevention and control clinicians\u2014whose day jobs included enforcing controls against droplet-borne infections in hospitals\u2014on key committees. 11 Airborne precautions for airborne diseases are, of course, a legitimate component of infection prevention and control science, but in practice this professional group has focused historically on droplet precautions. 12 At a press conference on 11 February 2020, WHO\u2019s director general announced that covid-19 was airborne. 8 After a prompt, he corrected himself and declared that the virus was transmitted by droplets (coughs, sneezes, and contaminated objects). The reasons for this hasty correction are not fully known but might have included a desire to prevent public panic and to avoid exacerbating a major supply chain issue with personal protective equipment 9 in the face of known international shortages. 10 The latest guidance from the UK Health Security Agency, introduced in April 2022 but withdrawn in May 2022 when all jurisdictions were asked to revert to their respective national guidance, continued to promote a situationally airborne narrative and restrict respirator use to aerosol generating procedures. 62 It did not recommend respirator masks for all covid-19 patient care. But the document glossary states, \u201cAirborne particles can be released when a person coughs or sneezes, and during [aerosol generating procedures].\u201d There remains wide variation in infection control policies in different NHS trusts (perhaps because some interpret the guidance as mandatory); those that provide respirator grade protection seem to have much lower nosocomial infection rates for covid-19. 63 The number of UK health and care workers infected with SARS-CoV-2 at work is not officially documented. The secretary of state for health and social care reported that by mid-2021, around 1500 had died of covid-19 and 120 000 had developed long covid (some of whom remained on long term sick leave). 60 In April 2020, excess deaths were noted among healthcare staff (especially men and ethnic minority groups) working outside intensive care units, and this impression was confirmed in subsequent academic publications. 61 In early 2021, the British Medical Association and Royal College of Nursing demanded respirator grade protection for all staff working with patients with covid-19. Although NERVTAG minutes from 6 March 2020 allude to severe shortages of respirator grade protective equipment, this was not made explicit in communications to either healthcare organisations or the public. A letter to UK healthcare organisations dated 28 March 2020 from NHS England and NHS Improvement, Public Health England, and the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges stated that, because of rising covid-19 cases and because \u201cmore was understood about the behaviour of the virus and its clinical outcomes,\u201d 59 respirator grade protection would now be restricted to aerosol generating procedures. 59 But this entire paragraph was removed from version 9.0 of the guidance (dated 10 March 2020). 58 Notes in a marked-up version 8.1 obtained by us under the Freedom of Information Act reveal a comment against the paragraph as follows: \u201csubject to change based on NERVTAG PPE decisions.\u201d The declassification of covid-19 in early March 2020 had profound implications for the protection of healthcare workers. The following sentence, for example, was present in version 8.1 of Health Protection Scotland\u2019s guidance for clinicians on infectious pathogens (dated 5 March 2020): \u201cThe precautionary principle should be applied for all novel or emerging respiratory pathogens of high consequence when the mode of transmission is incompletely determined. Airborne precautions (including the use of correctly fitted FFP3 respirators) should be applied for all patients admitted with suspected or confirmed covid-19.\u201d 57 NERVTAG minutes from 13 March 2020, however, show growing concern about shortages of respirator masks and the Department of Health and Social Care\u2019s request for \u201cadapted\u201d guidance that recommended surgical masks in most circumstances. 55 The deputy chief medical officer agreed to meet with the chair of the government\u2019s Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens, whose members \u201cwere unanimous in supporting the declassification of covid-19 [as a high consequence infectious disease].\u201d 55 As documented in the 9 January minutes of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG)\u2014an expert committee of the Department of Health and Social Care that advises the UK government, SARS-CoV-2 was initially classified as an airborne high consequence infectious disease by the four nations\u2019 public health agencies. 55 Consequently, staff caring for patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19 required filtering facepiece respirators (FFP3) or equivalent. This reflected guidance from the UK Health Security Agency (previously Public Health England) and Health and Safety Executive on other coronaviruses and avian influenza and legal requirements for employers to protect their workers against airborne biohazards. The Health and Safety Executive had concluded in 2008 that surgical masks \u201cshould not be used in situations where close exposure to infectious aerosols is likely.\u201d 56 Masking policies in the United States, and to a lesser extent the UK, were met with a strong libertarian backlash aligned with populist political leaders, right wing Christianity, anti-authoritarian social media groups, and, latterly, anti-vaccination groups. 53 In this context, masks came to symbolise pointless restriction of individual freedom, mindless compliance with authoritarian governments, and even blasphemy. 54 An influential inside track narrative seemed to conflate the absence of relevant randomised controlled trial evidence with evidence that masking was ineffective. 16 Outside track scientists argued for the precautionary principle, on the grounds that there was\u2014as early as March 2020\u2014indirect and mechanistic evidence (notably, around asymptomatic transmission) and strong theoretical arguments for public masking and huge potential risks associated with delay. 50 Mask mandates were finally introduced in England on 15 June (public transport) and 24 July 2020 (all public places). By then, public opinion was polarised, and many thought it was ineffective. 51 Most Asian countries had high public compliance with early masking policies and very low death rates; many western countries introduced masking late and had many more deaths, although causal links are complex and confounders many. 52 The confusion about masking in key decision making committees was due partly to confusion about mode of transmission. Asymptomatic transmission reflects a predominantly airborne route (because asymptomatic people are not coughing or sneezing), but the preoccupation with self-contamination and donning and doffing rituals reflected a predominantly droplet model ( box 1 ). Wearing a cloth or surgical mask protects others (imperfectly) from transmission by droplets and (to some extent) aerosols; wearing a well fitting respirator grade mask also provides strong protection for the wearer against aerosol transmission. 49 A presumption of droplet transmission explains the limited attention paid to the type of mask and the excessive concern about self-contamination. At its 4 February 2020 meeting, SAGE advised masks for patients with symptomatic covid-19 to reduce transmission \u201cif tolerated.\u201d 15 This group had acknowledged the potential for asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 on 28 January 2020 15 but did not make the logical leap to recommend that asymptomatic people should wear masks as source control. In official meetings between January and April 2020, either public masking was not mentioned or arguments against it\u2014lack of efficacy, harm, wastage\u2014were tabled (see supplementary file on bmj.com). 15 Public announcements and professional videos 48 issued by Public Health England between February and June 2020 presented masking as ineffective and potentially harmful on the grounds that people might take compensatory risks or self-contaminate while putting on or removing their mask (the \u201cdonning\u201d and \u201cdoffing\u201d of infection control jargon). They provided no evidence to support these claims. Libertarianism is a political ideology that favours individual choice, freedom, and a retreat from state and institutional control. Libertarians resist imposed rules and like to do their own research rather than trust scientists or government. Uncertainty and conflict about the value and place of public masking allowed libertarian messages and practices to flourish. Amnesty International depicted the UK\u2019s care home crisis as a gross breach of human rights in which thousands of vulnerable people had been treated as expendable. 45 The crisis was largely avoidable. Public Health England\u2019s guidance for care homes emphasised a situationally airborne narrative. 46 Because aerosol generating procedures are rarely undertaken in care homes, these settings were low priority for personal protective equipment. Under-emphasis of the importance of ventilation and no routine use of masks are likely to have greatly amplified transmission between infectious residents and care home staff. In Hong Kong, by contrast, surgical masks were mandated for all care home staff by late January 2020, and no excess care home deaths occurred in the first wave of covid-19 (March to June 2020). 47 On 23 March 2020, with up to 500 000 deaths and an overwhelmed NHS predicted, the UK\u2019s prime minister announced a national lockdown. Hospitals had switched into urgent discharge mode on 19 March, sending patients back to care homes without routine pre-discharge testing. Between March and June 2020, 18 104 deaths involving covid-19 and 11 169 additional deaths above the five year UK average occurred among care home residents. 44 These rituals of purification 43 powerfully reinforced the official narrative. \u201cClean\u201d and \u201ccontaminated\u201d came to be demarcated in terms of how recently and thoroughly hands had been sanitised and how far a droplet was assumed to travel ( box 1 ). The same rituals served to downplay or obscure the narrative of aerosol transmission\u2014which demarcated clean and contaminated in terms of air purity, with practices oriented to controlling indoor crowding and time spent indoors, ventilating or filtering air, and optimising quality and fit of masks ( box 1 ). These material and enacted features of policy discourse served to silence further the narrative that SARS-CoV-2 is airborne. The official droplet-but-not-airborne narrative materialised as artefacts (such as posters, disinfectant dispensers, and 2 metre distancing markers) and social practices (actions accepted and expected in particular contexts). Droplet directed practices became ubiquitous, as people washed hands and forearms assiduously for 20 seconds, quarantined and disinfected their post, and stayed a measured distance apart, and institutions installed and policed the various artefacts and practices. Discussion At the root of the UK\u2019s limited success in controlling transmission of SARS-CoV-2 lie flawed droplet-but-not-airborne and situationally airborne narratives. These narratives, and the false certainty with which they were conveyed, produced ineffective public health measures, contributed to shocking levels of care home deaths, exacerbated toxic discourse on masking, and justified withholding adequate protection from most health and care staff. Why did the flawed narratives prevail? We consider four complementary hypotheses. The first is psychological. Social representation theory holds that people faced with new information show two tendencies: anchoring (grounding the new in an existing framework of concepts, ideas, and values) and concretisation (in which something abstract is made meaningful by making it physical and tangible).64 People are unlikely to change their beliefs in light of complex and contravening evidence because this requires effort and causes aversion.65 Policy makers are known to exhibit \u201csatisficing\u201d\u2014meaning they narrow the parameters within which their decisions must make sense and be accountable, especially when threats are complex and urgent.66 These well documented psychological tendencies might underpin the tendency for business and policy decisions to show what has been termed \u201cescalation of commitment to a failing course of action.\u201d7 Our second hypothesis is scientific elitism. Scientists in infection control have amassed considerable scientific capital (influence, status, accolades); their favoured methods (randomised controlled trials) are greatly valued; and they have much to lose if they discard their long held droplet narrative and concede the importance of other kinds of evidence.11 The inside track for pandemic policy making in the UK and WHO was narrow and partisan,1167 enabling an unusual degree of power to be wielded against outside track scientific voices, imposing a narrow and rigid set of acceptable scientific methods (what Danziger called \u201cmethodolatry\u201d68), and precluding the kind of interdisciplinary deliberation that might have allowed a full and fair consideration of important competing narratives. The low status of aerosol science in policy circles was perhaps compounded by the relative youth of this scientific field and the inherent technical difficulties of isolating viable virus from the air (resulting in inconsistent findings in air sampling studies, especially when undertaken by non-experts).35 The science of indoor air quality (for example, how and when to open windows, what kinds of filters to use) might be (wrongly) viewed as unsophisticated compared with much of modern biomedicine.3 Our third hypothesis is practical and logistical. As confirmed in official minutes, the national shortage of high grade respiratory protective equipment was a live discussion topic in UK policy advisory groups at the beginning of the pandemic. Although adherence to a droplet-but-not-airborne narrative was not consciously undertaken purely because of this shortage, it certainly helped to make existing stocks go further. Our fourth hypothesis is political. Droplet precautions are, at least to some extent, under the control of individuals and hence resonate with neoliberal discourses about individual freedom, personal responsibility, and restraint of the state (although the \u201cchoice\u201d to distance physically, for example, presupposes sufficient space in which to do so). Airborne precautions require a paradigm shift in policy making, with strategic actions from those responsible for public safety; this approach aligns with a more socialist leaning political discourse and requires considerable up-front investment in the built environment whose benefits may take years to accrue.6 WHO\u2019s tweet (fig 1) emphasises how to protect yourself rather than what to expect of your employer, your child\u2019s school, or your government. Relatedly, we hypothesise a role for populism, the modus operandi of which is cherry picking evidence that supports the policy drive and validating anti-science sentiment under the guise of bringing power to people.69 Populism drew on public desires to return to normalcy and further marginalised aerosol science by depicting its recommended measures6 as obscure, unaffordable, and an enemy of the public interest. The narratives and dramas presented in this paper are not exhaustive. The framing of protection as a matter of individual responsibility, for example, also accommodates the current political narrative of \u201clearning to live with covid-19,\u201d in which good citizens stoically accept the endemicity of a\u2014hopefully attenuating\u2014virus in exchange for greater individual freedoms. The covid-19 pandemic can be framed as what Marcel Mauss (cited in Chaunlat70) calls a \u201ctotal social fact,\u201d a phenomenon that affects all domains and layers of society (economic, legal, political, religious) and requires us to draw evidence from across multiple scientific and other fields. In such circumstances, the combination of the cognitive biases and satisficing behaviour of policy makers, scientists\u2019 desire to protect their interests, and politicians\u2019 alignment with individualist values and populist sentiment proved perilous. As the pandemic continues to cause death and long term illness more than 30 months after the first case, airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the mitigations needed to tackle it (box 1) remain misunderstood and under-recognised. Extraordinarily, a recent UK inquiry into errors made in the pandemic did not mention masks or ventilation at all.71 Although we acknowledge that solutions are always much more evident in retrospect, we think that the inquiry should ask hard questions about policy makers\u2019 accountability in relation to past and ongoing omissions in this regard. We have 10 specific questions for the inquiry (box 4). Box 4 Questions for the inquiry 1. Why were early indications that this virus could be airborne overlooked by policy makers, resulting in public health measures that over-emphasised handwashing, surface cleansing, and 2 m distancing? What checks and balances might have helped policy makers keep a more open mind about mode of transmission rather than seeing it as a settled issue from an early stage? 2. Why did policy makers convey an unjustified level of scientific certainty about the mode of transmission and measures to prevent transmission, rather than sharing with the public that the mode was not yet known, as other countries did? How might the culture of UK policy bodies change to foster greater intellectual engagement with scientific uncertainty and how to handle it? 3. What were (and are) the membership and terms of reference of the UK\u2019s \u201cinfection prevention and control cell\u201d? Who appoints them? Who checks their work? Does this group include any experts on airborne transmission and the delivery of safe indoor air? Why did (and does) this group have such a high degree of influence on policy? Why are its activities (at least partly) hidden from the public? Where are the minutes of its meetings? 4. Why did policy makers continue to de-emphasise the evidence base on the airborne mode of transmission for so long, even as strong and consistent empirical evidence was accumulating? To what extent were cognitive biases operating at either individual or group level? How might such biases have been minimised or overcome? 5. Why did policy makers continue to place so much emphasis on droplet precautions even after they had accepted that the virus was likely airborne? Why was indoor air quality given so little attention not just at the beginning of the pandemic but two years (and counting) into it? 6. To what extent were policy decisions adversely influenced (either consciously or unconsciously) by the shortage of high grade personal protective equipment? Who made these decisions and what is the chain of accountability? 7. To what extent was the limited public confidence in the efficacy of masks influenced by negative policy announcements on this subject early in the pandemic? Why were early statements that masks were likely ineffective and could be harmful not corrected as evidence to refute them accumulated? What lessons might specific public health leaders be encouraged to learn from this error? 8. Why are UK health and care workers still not fully protected against airborne infections in the workplace? Why is a premature and false narrative that the pandemic is over being used to justify not supplying workers with personal protective equipment designed to protect against airborne pathogens? 9. Are experts in aerosol science now adequately represented on all key science advisory bodies and are measures in place to ensure that their advice is sought and heeded? 10. Why have policy makers put prime responsibility for preventive measures on individuals given that many effective preventive measures for airborne transmission are located at institutional and national policy levels? RETURN TO TEXT Bold action is now needed to ensure that the science of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is freed from the shackles of historical errors, scientific vested interests, ideological manipulation, and policy satisficing. Policy makers should actively seek to broaden the scientific inside track to support interdisciplinarity and pluralism as a route to better policies, greater accountability, and a reduction in the huge inequities that the pandemic has generated.",

This is a government that is uncomfortable with scrutiny. For example, it is thanks primarily to a series of judicial reviews launched by the Good Law Project that we know about the widespread abuses in procurement of essential equipment during the pandemic.10 In these circumstances, Hallett\u2019s warning that she will \u201cnot tolerate any attempt to mislead the inquiry, to undermine its integrity or its independence\u201d seems understandable.11 Another challenge will be assessing how the decision making process was informed and influenced. Throughout the pandemic politicians and their scientific advisers insisted that decision making would be \u201cguided by the science.\u201d However, evidence is socially constructed and can be highly contested.12 Different sources, and indeed types, of evidence are given different weight in developing policy: it is important to consider whose science counts, and why. To be useful in informing responses to future pandemics, the inquiry must come to a view about how the scientific evidence figured in decision making, and how approaches to bridging the evidence-to-policy boundary could have been more effective.13 Our analysis To help the inquiry in these areas, The BMJ has commissioned a series of articles examining how evidence was used to shape the response to the covid-19 pandemic in the UK (www.bmj.com\/covid-inquiry). We also explore how information was misused, abused, and manipulated to feed an ideologically driven \u201cinfodemic\u201d with global consequences for vaccine hesitancy and resistance to non-pharmaceutical interventions. The articles in the series describe successes and failures. The successes include the vaccine programme, at least in its early stages, and the response of the NHS in delivering the vaccine rollout, creating clinical learning networks, and in health service innovation. The Recovery trial,14 the OpenSafely data resource,15 and COG-UK, which provided genomic sequencing and some of the modelling, were world leading. In all of these, to some degree, the ability to generate evidence quickly drew on existing research platforms that had benefited from earlier public investment in medical and public health research. But many mistakes were made. This is forgivable when dealing with a new virus, but what is unforgivable is that they were not corrected as knowledge and experience accumulated. The pandemic response may become a case study for students of cognitive bias. The evidence that SARS-CoV-2 transmits through the air, in crowded and poorly ventilated places, was clear relatively early on. Even now, many policies ignore this vital fact. Children have been harmed through covid affecting them or family members, and through loss of education.16 The measures that would protect them, such as vaccination and improved ventilation in schools, attract lukewarm support at best. Those unlearnt lessons are also evident in how modelling was used to inform public policy,17 in implementation of covid-19 vaccination, in knowledge mobilisation and getting evidence into practice,1819 and in the role and positioning of science advice in policy making.20 Our conclusion is clear: with the toll approaching 200 000 excess deaths the UK\u2019s response should have been much better. In 2019, it had come second in the world in an index of pandemic preparedness.21 While debate continues about how best to compare the resilience of national health systems to shocks such as pandemics, there is little doubt that the UK\u2019s response fell far short of its potential. The effect of that mismanagement continues to be felt in the ongoing pressures on the workforce and patients in health and social care. The question is why? And that is the central question that the UK\u2019s covid-19 inquiry must answer. Each article in our series, which will continue over the next few weeks, offers a set of messages that we hope will inform the inquiry, as well as a list of questions that demand answers. But one message is universal and unequivocal: scientists and health workers on the front line of the response, and therefore the public, were too often let down by politicians.

        "title":"Monkeypox: New clinical symptoms are identified in confirmed cases",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.bmj.com\/content\/378\/bmj.o1845",
        "text":"Jacqui Wise Kent The largest study of confirmed monkeypox cases to date has identified new clinical symptoms that are similar to those of syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections and could easily lead to misdiagnosis.1 These symptoms included single genital lesions and sores on the mouth or anal mucosa. An international collaboration across 16 countries reported 528 infections that were diagnosed between 27 April and 24 June 2022. In the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, 95% of these patients presented with a rash, 73% had anogenital lesions, and 41% had mucosal lesions. A 10th of the patients (54) had only a single genital lesion. Another unexpected finding was that 15% had anal or rectal pain (or both). The study authors said that the current case definitions for monkeypox should be expanded to help diagnosis and slow the spread of infection. Existing definitions do recommend consideration of monkeypox in the context of any \u201cunusual\u201d rash but do not cover the full range of possible manifestations. \u201cThe current international case definitions need to be expanded to add symptoms that are not currently included, such as sores in the mouth, on the anal mucosa, and single ulcers,\u201d said Chloe Orkin, professor of HIV medicine at Queen Mary University of London and director of the Sexual Health and HIV All East Research (SHARE) collaborative, which is based in east London and investigates the inequalities that lead to poor sexual health and HIV. Orkin added, \u201cThese particular symptoms can be severe and have led to hospital admissions, so it is important to make a diagnosis. Expanding the case definition will help doctors more easily recognise the infection and so prevent people from passing it on.\u201d In the case series, 98% of the people infected were gay or bisexual men, 75% were white, and 41% had HIV. Common systemic features preceding the rash included fever (62%), lethargy (41%), myalgia (31%), headache (27%), and lymphadenopathy (56%). Among the 23 patients with a clear exposure history the median incubation period was seven days (range 3-20). Transmission was suspected to have occurred through sexual activity in 95% of the cases. Monkeypox virus DNA was detected in 29 of the 32 people in whom seminal fluid was analysed. However, this may be incidental, as it is not yet known whether it is present at high enough levels to facilitate sexual transmission. \u201cIt is important to stress that monkeypox is not a sexually transmitted infection in the traditional sense; it can be acquired through any kind of close physical contact,\u201d said study author John Thornhill, a consultant physician in sexual health and HIV and clinical senior lecturer at Barts NHS Health Trust and Queen Mary University of London. \u201cHowever, our work suggests that most transmissions so far have been related to sexual activity\u2014mainly, but not exclusively, among men who have sex with men.\u201d Most of the cases reported in the series were mild and self-limited, and there were no deaths. The study also found that HIV infection was not linked to monkeypox severity. Although 13% of the patients were admitted to a hospital, no serious complications were reported in the majority of those admitted. Common reasons for admission were pain and bacterial superinfection. However, the study authors pointed out that rare serious complications, including myocarditis and epiglottitis, were observed and that therefore longer term follow-up of cases was needed. Commenting on the study, Claire Dewsnapp, president of the British Association for Sexual Health, said the UK government must be bold in acting against monkeypox. \u201cThese measures must include an effective vaccine procurement and delivery plan, a clearly accountable national response lead, and a national plan for testing, assessment, treatment, and prevention,\u201d she said. As of 18 July 2022 there were 2137 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the UK, 2050 of them in England. Almost three quarters (73%) of England\u2019s cases were in London.2 In response to the rising number of cases the UK Health Security Agency said that it had procured an additional 100 000 doses of the smallpox vaccine Imvanex. Gay and bisexual men at high risk of exposure to monkeypox will be offered the vaccine.34 On 19 July the UK Health Security Agency also updated its guidance for close contacts of a confirmed monkeypox case.5 This said that close contacts won\u2019t need to isolate at home if they don\u2019t have symptoms, as the latest data showed that a relatively small number of close contacts had gone on to develop monkeypox and there was a lack of evidence of transmission outside close intimate or sexual contact.",

        "text":"Conclusion The findings suggest that vaccination against covid-19 during pregnancy is not associated with a higher risk of preterm birth, small for gestational age at birth, or stillbirth. Results Among 85 162 births, 43 099 (50.6%) occurred in individuals who received one dose or more of a covid-19 vaccine during pregnancy\u201442 979 (99.7%) received an mRNA vaccine. Vaccination during pregnancy was not associated with any increased risk of overall preterm birth (6.5% among vaccinated v 6.9% among unvaccinated; adjusted hazard ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.08), spontaneous preterm birth (3.7% v 4.4%; 0.96, 0.90 to 1.03), or very preterm birth (0.59% v 0.89%; 0.80, 0.67 to 0.95). No increase was found in risk of small for gestational age at birth (9.1% v 9.2%; 0.98, 0.93 to 1.03) or stillbirth (0.25% v 0.44%; 0.65, 0.51 to 0.84). Findings were similar by trimester of vaccination, mRNA vaccine product, and number of doses received during pregnancy. Main outcome measures Using Cox regression, hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated for preterm birth before 37 weeks (overall and spontaneous preterm birth), very preterm birth (<32 weeks), small for gestational age at birth (<10th centile), and stillbirth. Vaccination against covid-19 was treated as a time varying exposure in the outcome specific risk window, and propensity score weighting was used to adjust hazard ratios for potential confounding. Participants All liveborn and stillborn infants from pregnancies conceived at least 42 weeks before the end of the study period and with gestational age \u226520 weeks or birth weight \u2265500 g. Safety concerns about covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy remains a potential obstacle to improving coverage. As of July 2022, results published from epidemiological studies are reassuring\u2014two case-control studies of covid-19 vaccination in early pregnancy found no association with spontaneous abortion. 13 14 Our recent study of pregnancies to 30 September 2021, including 22 660 individuals vaccinated during the second or third trimester, did not show any association with adverse peripartum outcomes such as postpartum haemorrhage or low Apgar scores. 15 However, fewer studies have examined risk of adverse birth outcomes associated with prenatal covid-19 vaccination. A population based birth registry study from Sweden and Norway found no increased risks of preterm birth or small for gestational age at birth; importantly, stillbirth also was not associated with covid-19 vaccination in the study. 16 Two cohort studies including pregnant individuals insured through large health maintenance organisations observed no associations with preterm birth or small for gestational age at birth. 17 18 In a large, province-wide population, we evaluated whether covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy was associated with risk of preterm birth (including spontaneous preterm birth and very preterm birth), small for gestational age at birth, or stillbirth. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy has been associated with higher risks of admission to hospital, admission to an intensive care unit, and death for pregnant individuals. 1 2 3 Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with a higher risk of preterm birth, 3 4 5 fetal growth restriction, 4 postpartum haemorrhage, 4 and stillbirth. 6 Many countries recommend covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy, 7 which has been shown to be effective against covid-19 in pregnant individuals 8 as well as their newborns 9 10 ; however, vaccine coverage among pregnant individuals remains lower than among women of reproductive age. 11 12 Owing to covid-19 related resource and time constraints, it was not feasible to directly involve patients in the design, conduct, reporting, or writing of our study. Although no patients were directly involved, the study team included several obstetrical care providers who were involved from the outset of planning the study and brought forward their experiences from patient interactions related to covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy. These were taken into consideration in planning this research and its dissemination to ensure relevancy for a broad group of knowledge users, including pregnant people. In primary analyses, we evaluated vaccination status as receipt of one dose or more of a covid-19 vaccine in the outcome specific risk window. We performed subgroup analyses for preterm birth and small for gestational age at birth to evaluate trimester specific associations according to the number of doses (treating each dose as time varying), mRNA vaccine product for dose 1, and vaccine product combinations for those who received two mRNA doses; the number of events for the other outcomes was insufficient to conduct these subgroup analyses. In sensitivity analyses, we added covid-19 during pregnancy as a time varying covariate to the model and, separately, excluded individuals with a history of covid-19 during pregnancy. To assess for potential residual confounding, we stratified the original models by neighbourhood income (two highest and three lowest fifths) and limited the unvaccinated group to those who received their first vaccine dose after pregnancy, because in an earlier study of this population their baseline characteristics were shown to be more similar to individuals vaccinated during pregnancy than to those never vaccinated at any time. 15 We also repeated the original analyses limited to singleton births. We used extended Cox proportional hazards regression models with gestational age in days as the time scale, and robust sandwich variance estimation to account for statistical dependence across repeated observations as a result of changes in vaccination status, which was treated as time varying. We estimated hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals and used inverse probability of treatment weights to generate adjusted hazard ratios. 32 The weights were derived from a propensity score representing the predicted probability of having received one dose or more of a covid-19 vaccine during pregnancy\u2014for vaccine exposed births, the weight was computed as the inverse of the propensity score, and for unexposed births, the inverse of 1 minus the propensity score. To account for any extreme weights, we stabilised the weights to the entire population and trimmed the values to the 0.01st to 99.99th centiles. 32 Missing covariate values were assumed to be missing at random, and we imputed missing values before generating propensity scores using a fully conditional specification (MI procedure in SAS Version 9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 33 The percentage of missing data for any individual covariate included in propensity scores was low (range 0-3.5%), with the exception of body mass index, which had 10.2% missing. Across all the covariates included in the propensity scores, 15.4% of records had missing information for one or more covariates. Weighted Cox regression models from which we derived adjusted results were fitted on each of the five imputed datasets, and the results were combined using the MIANALYZE procedure (SAS Institute). As the distribution of maternal age after weighting the study population with the stabilised inverse probability of treatment weights remained imbalanced across the two exposure groups (as indicated by a standardised difference >0.1 34 ), all weighted models additionally included continuous maternal age. We used discrete time survival analysis to account for the time dependent nature of vaccination status and study outcomes. Each pregnancy contributed gestational time in days starting on the estimated date of conception (pregnancy day 14); ongoing pregnancies on 1 May (start of the study) started contributing time from that point (see supplementary fig 1), and follow-up continued until either the event or censoring at the end of the outcome specific risk window. We adjusted for a range of covariates potentially associated with study outcomes or covid-19 vaccination, or both, using propensity score methods: maternal age at delivery (years), prepregnancy body mass index \u226530 (v <30), self-reported smoking status (yes or no) or substance use during pregnancy (yes or no), public health unit region (seven regions), pre-existing maternal health conditions (composite of asthma, chronic hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, thyroid disease; yes or no), parity (number of previous live births and stillbirths), multi-fetal pregnancy (yes or no), rural or urban residence, neighbourhood income fifths, neighbourhood marginalisation fifths (four dimensions: residential instability, material deprivation, dependency, ethnic concentration), calendar week of conception (categorical), and first visit for prenatal care in the first trimester (yes or no). Supplementary table 2 provides additional details on outcomes and covariates. We defined preterm birth and very preterm birth as a live birth before 37 and 32 completed weeks of gestation, respectively. Preterm birth subtype was considered spontaneous if it occurred after spontaneous onset of labour or preterm premature rupture of membranes. 30 Small for gestational age at birth was defined as a singleton live born infant below the 10th centile of the sex specific birth weight for gestational age distribution, based on a Canadian reference standard. 31 Stillbirth was defined as an antepartum or intrapartum fetal death at \u226520 weeks, with the gestational timing of the event based on the date of birth (information on the exact timing of fetal death was not available). The end of the outcome specific risk windows were 36 weeks+6 days of gestation for preterm birth (pregnancy day 258), 31 weeks+6 days for very preterm birth (pregnancy day 223), and end of pregnancy for small for gestational age infants and stillbirths. Ontario\u2019s covid-19 vaccination programme began on 14 December 2020, 26 and pregnant individuals were designated as a priority population for vaccination on 23 April 2021. 27 Owing to a limited supply of covid-19 vaccines in Canada at that time, eligibility had not yet expanded to the general adult population; moreover, for several months during the spring of 2021, Canada used an extended dose interval of up to four months between the first and second vaccine dose. 28 On 18 May 2021, all people older than 18 years became eligible to receive a covid-19 vaccine, and on 15 December 2021, all people older than 18 years, including pregnant people, became eligible to receive a covid-19 booster dose. 29 From COVaxON, we identified vaccinations received between the estimated date of conception up to one day before birth. We treated vaccination as a time varying exposure within outcome specific risk windows\u2014in the main analyses of preterm birth outcomes and stillbirth, ongoing pregnancies changed status from unvaccinated to vaccinated on the day that dose 1 was received in the risk window (see supplementary fig 1). For the assessment of small for gestational age at birth, we lagged the date of dose 1 by 14 days, since any potential effect of vaccination on fetal growth would not happen acutely. 16 In subgroup analyses assessing the number of doses, an additional change in exposure status occurred if dose 2 was received in the risk window. Gestational timing of all doses received during pregnancy was classified as first trimester (pregnancy day 14 to 13 weeks+6 days), second trimester (14 weeks+0 days to 27 weeks+6 days), or third trimester (28 weeks+0 days to end of follow-up). Gestational age is recorded in the birth registry, and most pregnancy dating in Ontario is based on early ultrasound assessment. The birth registry receives records for all liveborn infants and stillborn infants \u226520 weeks\u2019 gestation or with birth weight \u2265500 g from hospitals, birth centres, and midwifery practice groups (home births) across Ontario. 21 Maternal personal characteristics, health behaviours, pre-existing health conditions, pregnancy history, obstetric complications, interventions, and birth outcomes are collected from medical records, clinical forms, and patient interview and were shown to be of high quality in a validation study. 23 Unique health card numbers (available for 96.9% of the study population) were used to deterministically link birth records to the COVaxON database, which captures all covid-19 immunisations in the province. Since 1 March 2020, information on individuals with confirmed covid-19 during pregnancy has been captured from two sources: a voluntary hospital based or midwifery practice group based case report form submitted directly to the birth registry, and through deterministic linkage with Ontario\u2019s database containing all individuals with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed covid-19 reported to public health (Public Health Case and Contact Management Solution). 24 During the study period, free PCR testing was widely available and recommended for anyone with symptoms of covid-19 or those in close contact with an individual with confirmed covid-19, or both. Finally, maternal residential postal code was used to link to area based socioeconomic data from Statistics Canada\u2019s 2016 census and the Ontario Marginalization Index. 25 We conducted a population based retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada, which provides publicly funded healthcare to all residents, including services relating to prenatal and obstetrical care. The provincial birth registry (Better Outcomes Registry and Network (BORN Ontario)) 21 was used to identify the study population\u2014after extracting records for completed pregnancies between 1 May and 31 December 2021, we extracted the corresponding births to create distinct records for each live birth and stillbirth, including multi-fetal pregnancies. We excluded births to non-Ontario residents and births from pregnancies conceived less than 42 weeks before the end of the study (ie, last menstrual period date after 10 March 2021) to avoid cohort truncation bias caused by overrepresentation of preterm births close to the end of the study period. 22 We also excluded any records with gestational age <20 weeks and birth weight <500 g, or following pregnancy termination, as these events are not systematically collected in the registry (see supplementary table 1 for additional details of data sources). 21 Results After exclusions, 85 162 live births and stillbirths occurred during the study period (fig 1); of these, 43 099 (50.6%) were related to individuals who received one dose or more of a covid-19 vaccine during pregnancy. Those vaccinated during pregnancy were more likely to be \u226530 years of age, nulliparous, and live in the highest income neighbourhoods; they were less likely to be smokers, report substance use during pregnancy, or live in a rural setting (table 1 and table 2). A total of 3328 births (3.9%) were to individuals who had covid-19 during pregnancy. The proportion with covid-19 during pregnancy was lower in the vaccinated group than unvaccinated group (2.9% v 4.9%; table 2). However, most of the covid-19 episodes in the vaccinated group (1056\/1247; 84.6%) preceded dose 1 by a median of 10.1 weeks (interquartile range 5.3-17.6 weeks).

Overall, 12.1% (n=5213) received dose 1 during the first trimester, 48.1% (n=20 715) during the second trimester, and 39.8% (n=17 171) during the third trimester.

(Bottom panel) Gestational age in days when dose 1 and dose 2 were received, among births to individuals who received only two doses during pregnancy (n=29 650). Data for individuals who received three doses during pregnancy (n=33) are not shown. Vertical dotted line represents the end of the risk window for preterm birth (pregnancy day 258) Overall, 5719 (6.7%) preterm births occurred; 3450 (4.1%) were spontaneous preterm births (table 4). The cumulative incidence of overall preterm birth was 6.5% among those who were vaccinated during pregnancy and 6.9% among those who were unvaccinated during pregnancy. Vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of overall preterm birth (adjusted hazard ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.08), spontaneous preterm birth (0.96, 0.90 to 1.03), or very preterm birth (0.80, 0.67 to 0.95). In subgroup analyses, results for overall preterm birth were similar by trimester (adjusted hazard ratios: first trimester, 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.10; second trimester 0.98, 0.91 to 1.04; third trimester 1.00, 0.92 to 1.08) and vaccine product for dose 1, as well as by number of doses received during pregnancy, and vaccine product combination for those who received both doses during pregnancy (see supplementary table 3). Subgroup analyses could not be conducted for spontaneous preterm birth or very preterm birth owing to the small number of events. Table 4 Association between covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy and study outcomes View this table: The cumulative incidence of small for gestational age at birth was 9.1% (n=3743) among births to individuals who received one dose or more of a covid-19 vaccine during pregnancy, and 9.2% (n=3722) among births to unvaccinated individuals. No association was observed between vaccination during pregnancy and small for gestational age at birth overall (adjusted hazard ratio 0.98, 0.93 to 1.03; table 4), or in subgroup analyses by trimester and vaccine product for dose 1 (see supplementary table 3). A small increased association was observed for only dose 1 administered during pregnancy (1.09, 1.01 to 1.16), which was not observed among individuals who received two doses during pregnancy (0.92, 0.87 to 0.97; see supplementary table 3). The cumulative incidence of stillbirth was 0.25% (n=107) among births to individuals who received one dose or more of a covid-19 vaccine during pregnancy, and 0.44% (n=184) among births to unvaccinated individuals. Vaccination was not associated with any increase in the risk of stillbirth (0.65, 0.51 to 0.84; table 4). The number of stillbirths was not large enough for subgroup analyses.",

        "title":"Investigating the monkeypox outbreak",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.bmj.com\/content\/377\/bmj.o1314",
        "text":"Christopher Dye , professor of epidemiology , Moritz U G Kraemer , associate professor of computational and genomic epidemiology Department of Biology, University of Oxford, UK Correspondence to: C Dye christopher.dye{at}zoo.ox.ac.uk Here\u2019s what we know, and what we need to know Between 4 and 25 May, 221 confirmed (by reverse transcriptase PCR) and 86 suspected cases of monkeypox have been reported from 23 countries in Europe plus Argentina, Australia, Canada, United Arab Emirates, and the United States.1 Such a large number of cases has never previously been reported from so many countries outside Africa in just a few weeks. New cases are being reported daily; more can be expected and in more locations. Why the extraordinary surge now? What do we need to know to stop it? Almost all patients so far are male (three are female) and presented with symptoms typical of monkeypox, including fever, vesicular rash, skin lesions and ulcers, and swollen lymph nodes.2 The first case in this outbreak was a man who visited Nigeria from the UK.3 He developed a rash on 29 April before leaving Nigeria, arriving back in the UK on 4 May. He was immediately isolated at a London hospital on the same day. His contacts on the flight to the UK, together with others in the community plus healthcare staff, are being followed for 21 days, considered the upper limit of the incubation period for monkeypox.4 By 24 May, none of these contacts had reported symptoms. Another 70 confirmed cases have been reported in the UK (all in England except one in Scotland), in several different groups. There is evidently person-to-person transmission within groups but no known links between groups or with the first case in England. One group is a household of three; another is four men who identify as gay or bisexual and seem to have been infected in London.5 Other than the man who was the first case, none have recently visited, or are known to have contacts that visited, endemic areas of Africa. Informed response Against this background, at least six lines of investigation will help to develop national and global responses in the coming days and weeks. The first is to find out whether the exceptionally large number of exported infections is linked to the increased frequency of travel to and from endemic areas of Africa now that covid restrictions have been lifted. If it is, published travel schedules between countries will help to specify and then mitigate risk around the world. The second is to investigate whether and how the spread of monkeypox is being driven by a rise in case numbers at source in west and central Africa. The number of monkeypox cases increased in Africa between 1970-79 and 2010-19 following the demise of smallpox and the decline in smallpox vaccination, especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).67 This rise has included major outbreaks, the largest of which affected 17 states of Nigeria in 2017-18.89 Thirdly, the main routes of transmission need to be re-examined. The 2017-18 Nigerian epidemic was caused by multiple introductions from animals (most likely rodents) to humans, plus limited and perhaps non-sustaining chains of transmission between people.81011 Now, however, waning immunity to smallpox and smallpox (vaccinia) vaccine could have magnified the risk of sustained transmission between people, within and beyond Africa.1213 The relative importance of different transmission routes could also have changed. Close contact is normally needed to acquire infection from skin lesions, body fluids, exhaled droplets, or contaminated clothing and bedding. The discovery of cases among gay and bisexual men, notably in Canada, Spain, and the UK, points to sex as one among other forms of close contact, although monkeypox is not primarily a sexually transmitted disease. Fourthly, we need to reassess what proportion of infections cause severe or fatal disease. Historically, two different genomic clades of monkeypox virus have been described in west and central Africa.7 All cases so far genotyped in Europe during the current outbreak are more closely related to the west African clade and to viruses exported from Nigeria to Israel, Singapore, and the UK in 2018 and 2019.1415 The west African clade has been associated with milder illness and a lower case fatality rate (roughly 4%) than the central African clade (roughly 10%).7 If some infections are asymptomatic, as previously described,11 these estimates of case fatality could be too high. Asymptomatic cases might also be missing links in transmission chains. Case fatality, and the risk of severe disease, can be reduced with some antivirals effective against poxviruses, but there is undoubtedly more to be learnt about supportive and therapeutic clinical care.16 The fifth line of investigation is to determine whether monkeypox could evolve, or has recently evolved, to become more pathogenic or more transmissible, or transmissible in a different way. Monkeypox virus is genetically variable and adaptable. The two main African clades consist of multiple lineages and many variants within each lineage. One genetic deletion identified in samples from DRC has been associated with human-to-human transmission.17 Clinical, epidemiological, and genomic surveillance is vital to detect possible changes in mode of transmission, human susceptibility, infectiousness, and pathogenicity.1518 Lastly in this short list, the effectiveness of vaccination in protecting individuals and populations should be further evaluated. Because smallpox is caused by an orthopoxvirus closely related to monkeypox, pre-exposure inoculation with vaccinia vaccine is efficacious (about 85%) against monkeypox disease and probably also reduces onward transmission.19 Post-exposure inoculation gives less protection, so vaccine effectiveness in practice\u2014assessed, for example, while tracing and vaccinating contacts of cases20\u2014will depend on what proportion of people at risk can be immunised before rather than after acquiring infection. On present evidence, monkeypox is unlikely to become a global health emergency. Nevertheless, vigilance and open minded investigation are needed worldwide because until these and other questions are answered, we will not know how best to contain the unprecedented spread of this disease.

        "text":"Kamran Abbasi , editor in chief The BMJ kabbasi{at}bmj.com Follow Kamran on Twitter @KamranAbbasi With \u201cbiblical\u201d floods affecting tens of millions of people in Pakistan, and a cost of energy crisis that threatens the health and wellbeing of millions of children and elderly people in the UK alone (doi:10.1136\/bmj.o2113),1 there are only four certainties: death, taxes, a worsening climate emergency, and the relentless growth in energy companies\u2019 profits. The link between energy policy and health has never been clearer. A new investigation by The BMJ finds that hospitals in the UK are predicting that they will be forced to cut patients\u2019 services to pay their \u201ceye watering\u201d energy bills this winter (doi:10.1136\/bmj.o2088).2 Inevitably, the commitment of staff will be relied on to keep the health service going, but how much is left in the well of goodwill? Besides workload pressures, NHS consultants remain aggrieved over pay and pensions (doi:10.1136\/bmj.o2073),3 while GPs are losing the sense of \u201cspecialness\u201d that attracted them to primary care (doi:10.1136\/bmj.o2002).4 It may be worth remembering how August 2022 feels, because a politician or a commentator may tell you in a year or two that the NHS and energy crises were figments of our imaginations, that the public or experts panicked and foisted disastrous policies on politicians. That\u2019s exactly the narrative gathering momentum around covid-19, and it is a narrative that dishonestly disregards the unprecedented pressures on staff, services, and patients (https:\/\/www.spectator.co.uk\/article\/the-lockdown-files-rishi-sunak-on-what-we-werent-told).5 It is the very sort of magical thinking that delayed interventions and precautions and that caused each wave of covid deaths and illness to be worse than it needed to be (https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2022\/aug\/25\/the-guardian-view-on-rishi-sunak-a-claim-too-far).6 A public inquiry has begun into why the UK seemed so well prepared yet performed so disastrously (https:\/\/covid19.public-inquiry.uk\/2022\/07\/uk-covid-19-inquiry-launches-first-investigation).7 It is an inquiry that The BMJ, among others, has pushed for since 2020 (doi:10.1136\/bmj.m2052).8 The lessons must be learnt so mistakes are not repeated. One point of controversy is the use and misuse of science to inform policy decisions, and The BMJ has commissioned a series of papers on how science was interpreted and applied in key areas (doi:10.1136\/bmj.o2066).9 Each paper offers take home messages for the inquiry and proposes a set of questions it must explore further if it is to fulfil its mandate. The papers in the series aren\u2019t non-committal. We are not indulging in \u201cboth-sideism\u201d (doi:10.1136\/bmj.o2136),10 although as ever we understand that not everybody will agree and welcome ongoing debate through our rapid responses on bmj.com and our letters pages. The papers\u2019 authors take a position and substantiate it. The first two papers focus on airborne transmission and on children and schools. Trisha Greenhalgh and colleagues are unequivocal that the flawed narrative that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was by droplets rather than by being airborne resulted in avoidable infections and deaths\u2014and still causes harm today (doi:10.1136\/bmj-2022-069940).11 Deepti Gurdasani and colleagues argue that UK pandemic policy for schools and children was an international outlier, downplayed the importance of precautionary measures, and accelerated community transmission (doi:10.1136\/bmj-2022-071234).12 The verdict of The BMJ\u2019s covid inquiry papers is clear: scientists, health workers on the front line, and the public were let down by politicians. They were \u201clions led by donkeys.\u201d What\u2019s true of the UK will resonate in many other countries. The job of the UK\u2019s inquiry is to find out why this happened and to prevent it happening again. In the meantime, with the prospect of a catastrophic winter ahead, amid dire warnings of a humanitarian crisis from the NHS Confederation and Michael Marmot, to name but two (doi:10.1136\/bmj.o2113, doi:10.1136\/bmj.o2088, doi:10.1136\/bmj.o2129),1213 the sense that the politicians of the day and their supporters haven\u2019t grasped the depth of crisis we are facing\u2014or that if they do grasp it they have chosen not to help the people most in need\u2014means that the public and health workers must be ready to be failed again.

When even Paul Offit is speaking out, you know you\u2019ve jumped the shark The FDA takes the same approach to approving seasonal flu shots, which change from year to year depending on what the government claims is the most prominent circulating strain. Instead of relying on sound scientific data for each individual type of injection, the FDA just assumes that each new jab formulation is the same as all the others: perfectly \u201csafe and effective.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m uncomfortable that we would move forward \u2013 that we would give millions or tens of millions of doses to people \u2013 based on mouse data,\u201d said Paul Offit, an FDA adviser and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. As you may recall from past reporting, Paul Offit \u201cFor Profit\u201d has long been a heavy proponent of vaccines. He once stated that a child could receive 10,000 vaccine doses at once and be just fine. This was before Operation Warp Speed, though. Offit now speaks like many of us, expressing perplexity at the new rules of the game that say no testing required when it comes to new injections. Offit supports a no testing modality for flu shots because he says influenza strains mutate too fast for Big Pharma to keep up. For covid, he is against the idea of the FDA just rubber-stamping approval based on little or no testing. We are told that the FDA will not only not be requiring any new human clinical trials, it will also not be convening its advisory members who would normally evaluate the data and make appropriate recommendations. Califf indicated in his tweeting spree that the FDA has called off an advisory panel meeting, stating it has no further questions about the shot that would necessitate it. \u201cWe\u2019ve validated the process several times over and continue to produce safe and effective vaccines against Covid-19,\u201d declared a spokeswoman from Pfizer, joining Moderna which made the same declaration. What this means for the average person is that the U.S. government will once again be shoving experimental poisons down your throat \u2013 except this time, those poisons are not even being tested like the first round (sorta) were.

        "text":"by W. Aaron Vandiver, Childrens Health Defense: If we carefully analyze each aspect of the \u201cworld war\u201d on COVID-19, we can see how each tactic and high-tech \u201cweapon\u201d has harmed human health, destabilized civil society and possibly disrupted the ecological balance between the human population and the virus, while enriching private interests and empowering financially captured government regulators. Bill Gates has called the global response to COVID-19 a \u201cworld war.\u201d His militaristic language has been echoed by Dr. Anthony Fauci and other architects of COVID-19 policy for the last two and half years. TRUTH LIVES on at https:\/\/sgtreport.tv\/ To fight their \u201cworld war,\u201d Gates and Fauci and their allies have deployed an arsenal of high-tech \u201cweapons\u201d and tech-enabled tools of social control \u2014 contact tracing apps, PCR tests, QR codes, digital passports, lockdowns, mask mandates, mRNA vaccines, social media censorship, mass surveillance and so on \u2014 with devastating consequences for civil societies, human health and even the environment. As an advocate for wildlife conservation, I have been appalled as virtually all environmentalists, and most others on the left, have supported this disastrous high-tech \u201cwar\u201d on COVID-19. I believe that an ecological perspective reveals many of the flaws inherent in an aggressive high-tech attack on a pathogen, although most environmentalists have been too blinded by progressive political ideologies and the hysteria surrounding COVID-19 to see this truth. In addition to criticisms leveled at pandemic policies by civil libertarians and public-health experts such as the authors of the Great Barrington Declaration \u2014 critiques that I appreciate \u2014 I tend to view the pandemic in accord with insights I have gained while trying to protect the planet\u2019s biodiversity, a point of view that many critics may not have thought about, and may even be inclined to dismiss. To me, the \u201cwar\u201d on COVID-19 has been characterized by a destructive set of attitudes, beliefs and behaviors that appear to be deeply engrained in our political and economic institutions, and which form a pattern that should be recognizable to conservationists and ecologists: Aggressive intervention in complex natural processes using new, poorly understood technologies designed to achieve narrowly defined short-term goals, with disregard for the potential long-term ramifications; Profiteering by private interests that own the technologies, enabled by government entities and \u201cexperts\u201d that have been financially captured by those interests; Followed by a cascade of unintended consequences. Each aspect of the \u201cwar\u201d on COVID-19 can be understood in these terms. To explain, I will first elaborate on how I see the global response to COVID-19 through the lens of ecology. Ecology and aggressive technological \u201cwars\u201d against complex living systems \u201cThe first rule of ecology is that everything is connected to everything else,\u201d wrote the ecologist Barry Commoner in the 1970s. Or as the legendary naturalist John Muir, founder of Sierra Club (recently canceled by his own organization), wrote a hundred years before, \u201cWhen we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe.\u201d Ecological damage often ensues when people aggressively try to control complex natural processes to achieve short-term goals without truly understanding how those living systems work, or what the full range of ramifications will be, usually with new technologies that promise \u201cprogress\u201d but have a variety of consequences that cannot be managed over the long run. In my opinion, this is one reason why our global industrial economy, which interferes in natural processes on a massive scale across the planet, has brought about a multi-faceted ecological crisis that has seen a dramatic collapse in the planet\u2019s biodiversity, including an average 70% decline in Earth\u2019s wildlife populations since 1970, among other symptoms of environmental degradation (I won\u2019t even mention the \u201cC\u201d word). An example of an ecologically destructive practice that fits this pattern is the Big Ag\/ Big Pharma industry\u2019s worldwide chemical \u201cwar\u201d on plant and animal pathogens using herbicides, pesticides, antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals. The world\u2019s most popular herbicide, glyphosate, has harmed global biodiversity over the last five decades and has potentially caused many human health problems, including cancer. (Acknowledging these harms is not to endorse the anti-farmer measures recently enacted in the Netherlands, Canada and elsewhere). The \u201cwar\u201d on insects waged via the widespread application of the chemical insecticide DDT in the mid-20th century also caused vast ecological damage across many species that Rachel Carson exposed in her book \u201cSilent Spring\u201d giving rise to the modern-day environmental movement. Studies still link DDT to elevated risks of cancer in children and grandchildren of women who were exposed to the chemical decades ago. A similar ecologically destructive practice is the \u201cwar\u201d that has been waged for decades on apex predators like wolves, bears and big cats at the behest of industrial agricultural interests, often accomplished through the large-scale spreading of chemical poisons across landscapes, triggering negative \u201ctrophic cascades\u201d throughout U.S. and global ecosystems. I cannot help but notice that the high-tech \u201cwar\u201d on COVID-19 resembles these industrial \u201cwars\u201d against the natural world in many respects. The whole \u201cwar\u201d concept is based on a militaristic, mechanistic way of thinking that is obsessed with exerting technological control over natural processes to achieve short-term aims \u2014 often eradication of a \u201cthreat\u201d like a pathogen or a predator \u2014 but cannot recognize the long-term consequences of interfering in the complex set of biological relationships that support natural ecosystems, and that ultimately provide the basis for human health and well-being. Gates exemplifies this mindset, with his techno-utopian beliefs that human pathogens are like computer viruses, that human biology can be manipulated like computer code, and that vaccines can be regularly \u201cuploaded\u201d into the human body like software updates. He has a wrongheaded, war-like notion, as observed by economist Jeffrey A. Tucker, that \u201cwith enough money, intelligence, and power, along with technological know-how at the helm, [a virus] can be stopped in its tracks.\u201d Gates\u2019s militaristic COVID-19 strategy of retreat (lockdowns and masks) and attack (mass mRNA vaccination) was never based on a wholistic understanding of how human populations interact with pathogens and co-exist with them over time, how individual citizens remain healthy or how human societies thrive. \u201cThe pandemic is not a war,\u201d says Indian activist Dr. Vandana Shiva, one of Gates\u2019s staunchest critics, and one of the only prominent ecologists to criticize his COVID-19 policies. \u201cIn fact,\u201d she says, \u201cwe are part of the biome. And we are part of the virome [the set of all viruses present in the human body]. The biome and the virome are us.\u201d In other words, co-existence with pathogens is the rule in ecology, eradication of a pathogen from nature is the rare exception and declaring \u201cwar\u201d on any part of a complex living system can have significant unintended consequences. But for Gates and Fauci and others in power, waging high-tech \u201cwars\u201d on viruses is far more amenable to their interests than a humble approach based on the subtle principle of ecology (or the traditional precepts of public health prior to March 2020). Using new technologies to control natural processes for short-term gain, with disregard for long-term ecological consequences, is the business model. In fact, the more ecological damage that is caused, the more that further technological interventions can be justified, raising the question of whether \u201cunintended\u201d consequences are in some cases intended. As explained further below, the failure of each aspect of the \u201cwar\u201d on COVID-19 can be described and understood in ecological terms, including lockdowns, masks, mRNA mass vaccination and even the origins of the virus itself. Origins of the virus: Who is the real bio-terrorist, Mother Nature or Anthony Fauci? One of the great ironies of the global response to COVID-19 is that one of its prime architects, Fauci, may have been partly responsible for the pandemic. Fauci and other powerful figures in the international bio-security establishment have long ignored the ecological risks of tampering with natural viruses using bio-weapons technology. This is an important factor that may have led to the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. As soon as the pandemic started, Fauci immediately and vigorously began promoting the unproven theory that SARS-CoV-2 jumped naturally from wild animals to humans, and he even orchestrated a behind-the-scenes campaign to discredit alternative theories.

        "link":"https:\/\/americanfreepress.net\/judging-the-covid-19-pandemic-excess-deaths-is-the-best-metric\/",
        "text":"By Dr. Kevin Barrett The American people, polarized as never before, can hardly agree on anything. Between the hysteria purveyed by legacy fake news media on the left, and Fox News and \u201calternative facts\u201d on the right, the mainstream political discussion is a nonstop shouting match. (And yes, I realize that alternative facts are sometimes more factual than mainstream ones.) Daniel Patrick Moynihan\u2019s witticism, \u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts,\u201d has never been more apropos. In the middle of a pandemic, it would be nice to have some trustworthy facts. Unfortunately, many of the establishment\u2019s key claims are debatable. Where, when, and how did Covid-19 emerge? Are the tests accurate? How many cases are there? How many actual deaths have occurred from Covid-19? Do lockdowns and masks really work? What are the most promising medications? Should ventilators be used, and if so, when? Could a safe and effective vaccine be devised quickly enough to help? The World Health Organization, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other establishment bureaucracies offer answers to these questions. But their answers often raise even more questions. The U.S. claim that Covid-19 emerged naturally in October from animals at a Wuhan market is almost certainly wrong, for too many reasons to list here. The mandate to \u201ctest, test, test\u201d is questionable given the dubious reliability of the tests. For that reason and others, nobody knows how many cases exist. Likewise, it isn\u2019t always clear which deaths are Covid deaths; the official counts may be too low or too high, depending on whom you believe. Likewise, the efficacy of masks is debatable, as is the question of whether a \u201ccocktail\u201d including hydroxychloroquine and zinc, or vitamins C and\/or D3, could be useful treatments. And the sensitive issue of whether ventilators have been saving patients or killing them is far from settled. Finally, the prospect of a workable vaccine, despite the billions of dollars being thrown at it, is uncertain to say the least. So, do we know anything about Covid-19? Do we even know there is a real pandemic out there? Yes, we do. The best metric, the one least likely to be wrong, is the excess death rate: the difference between the number of deaths expected to occur in a given time frame, and the number of deaths that actually occur. Though it may not always be clear whether someone died of Covid, with Covid, or of something else that could be mistaken for Covid, the fact that the person is dead is \u201cdead certain.\u201d Procedures for counting deaths are far more accurate than, say, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques for counting viruses. What do overall death counts tell us? First takeaway: Prior to March 20, 2020, there were no discernable excess deaths in the U.S. Then suddenly, during the last 10 days in March, the overall death count shot up, peaking during the first two weeks of April, then quickly declining back to zero by mid-May. So, April, as TS Eliot said in another context, was indeed the cruelest month. (As of this writing, statistics for June are not yet available; but since reported Covid deaths are not keeping pace with reported new cases, it seems likely that the overall death count remained fairly flat in June.) The spike in excess deaths in April supports the establishment narrative in some ways, but also raises questions. It confirms that Covid-19 spread wildly in February and early March, leading to the spike in April deaths. It also confirms that the March and April lockdowns were presumably effective in slowing the spread of the virus, so that by mid-May there were no more discernable excess deaths in America. But wait! Officially, there were roughly 15,000 \u201cconfirmed Covid deaths\u201d between May 15 and June 1. Yet as we have seen, there seem to have been no overall excess deaths. Did 15,000 people who would have died otherwise somehow survive thanks to the Covid pandemic, balancing out the 15,000 Covid deaths? That seems unlikely. But it may be that the Covid emergency is somehow saving at least some lives\u2014especially the lives of young children. According to official statistics, \u201cStarting in early March, expected deaths (of children) began a sharp decline, from an expected level of around 700 deaths per week to well under 500 by mid April and throughout May.\u201d Has the drastic drop in childhood vaccinations been saving kids\u2019 lives? Or are infants receiving more and better attention from parents who are staying home rather than working? Bottom line: The Covid pandemic, and the bungling and confusing official response, has raised far more questions than answers. Those who want cold, hard facts should keep an eye on excess death statistics.

        "text":"This event exemplified how Christians and the scientific community can work together to advance God\u2019s purposes and kingdom in the midst of the COVID crisis. Dr. Anderson, a pastor of a large, multicultural church in Maryland, shared some of his congregants\u2019 questions and concerns about the vaccine. Are the vaccines safe? Were people of color represented in the vaccine trials? Are the vaccines derived from aborted fetal tissues? Can you get the vaccine if you are pregnant or nursing? What will our social gatherings be like once we are vaccinated? Practical questions that were answered by the leading scientist in our country, Dr. Collins. As I listened to these Christian men share their knowledge and expertise, I wished that my skeptical friends and family could have watched the live stream with me. I\u2019d love to have the opportunity to ask my friends and family questions about what they heard. Did any of Dr. Collins\u2019 answers resonate with them and alleviate some of their fears or concerns? And if not, what would it take to convince them that the vaccine was safe and effective? In a time where many evangelical Christians do not trust the scientific community, events like this are key to re-establishing that trust. I am thankful for pastors, like Dr. Anderson, who act as bridge builders between the scientific community and their congregations. It takes courage to challenge peoples\u2019 suppositions, even when love is the motivation. I am thankful for Dr. Collins and all of the scientists who contributed to the development of the COVID-19 vaccine. God has gifted these men and women with wisdom and intelligence that I am in awe of. And I am thankful for the doctors, nurses, and aids who have been on the frontline of this pandemic, working long hours under extremely stressful situations. God, in his amazing love, has provided us a way out of this pandemic. As I walked into the vaccine center last week to receive my first shot, I thanked him for the gift of this vaccine. Not only was I being provided with protection from this deadly virus, but I was contributing to the health and well-being of those around me. And in a small way, it was my contribution to ending the pandemic.",

One of this week\u2019s sessions was to look up \u201cmiracle\u201d and see whether we can appropriately say that the COVID vaccines are a miracle. Here are the first three definitions given: an effect or extraordinary event in the physical world that surpasses all known human or natural powers and is ascribed to a supernatural cause. such an effect or event manifesting or considered as a work of God. a wonder; marvel. I think lots of people look at #3 and think, \u201cOK, maybe in a loose sense we can say \u2018It was a miracle that I passed that test\u2019 or talk about the Miracle on Ice when the US hockey team improbably beat the Russians in the 1980 Olympics.

But we know that biology explains that process pretty well. In the more precise sense, it\u2019s not really a miracle. It\u2019s #1 that most people take to be the real definition of a miracle: it is beyond the capacity of nature, and we must invoke supernatural forces to explain it.

        "text":"The vaccine is the key to our global recovery from the pandemic. But currently there exists a sizable number of Christians who have indicated they are suspicious of the vaccine. My name is Curtis Chang, and welcome to Redeeming Babel, where our mission is to provide Biblical thinking in a confusing world. In this series, I want to take seriously the questions that some Christians have about the vaccine. But I want to make the case that after considering those questions, ultimately all Christians should indeed take the vaccine, and do so for important Biblical reasons. There are several questions being asked by Christians. We will examine these questions in our other videos. However, I believe everyone starts with that first question, \u201cIs the vaccine safe?\u201d So this video will focus on vaccine safety. If you can only watch one video, I recommend you too start with this one. So, let\u2019s ask the question: \u201cIs the vaccine safe?\u201d I do believe the vaccine is safe. This is a major reason why I encourage all Christians to take the vaccine. But I think the way this question has gotten framed has unfortunately fallen into the division affecting our country. How the question has been framed In our divided society, each side is doing a great deal of eye rolling at the other side. The \u201cYes\u201d side rolls their eyes at the \u201cNo\u201d side, and dismisses anti-vaxxers as \u201canti-science\u201d and \u201cignorant.\u201d The \u201cNo\u201d side rolls their eyes at the \u201cYes\u201d side, and dismisses the majority as being \u201cSheeple!\u201d \u201cSheeple\u201d is a term used by some anti-vaxxers to describe people just mindlessly following conventional wisdom like sheep. \u201cThink for yourself!\u201d is the cry of the \u201cNo\u201d side. The way this debate is framed is not accurate or fair to either side. For instance, it really isn\u2019t accurate or fair for the \u201cYes\u201d side to claim their side knows science and the \u201cNo\u201d side is just being ignorant. I\u2019m someone that is on the \u201cYes\u201d side. But if I\u2019m honest with myself, I have to ask, \u201cHow much do I really know the science of the vaccine?\u201d Yes, I\u2019ve read several news articles on the vaccine. But have I really mastered even the basics of the science involved? For instance, could I even name the chemical ingredients of the vaccine? No, I can\u2019t. Could I explain with any scientific detail why the vaccine attacks the virus but is somehow safe for me? If I actually tried, I have about 15 seconds of material and then I start mumbling. I have not read for myself any of the underlying scientific research papers on vaccine safety. And even if I did, I couldn\u2019t understand most of it. If I\u2019m honest, when it comes to the actual science behind vaccine safety, I\u2019m rather, well, \u201cignorant.\u201d So, why do I believe the vaccine is safe? Well, the No side does have a point. It is not because I am \u201cthinking for myself\u201d in the sense that I am not depending on anyone else. In truth, I believe the vaccine is safe because I trust others tasked with answering that question for me. I trust the expert leaders of the scientific institutions like Dr. Francis Collins who heads the National Institute of Health (the NIH). Dr. Collins, by the way, is a devout evangelical Christian and one of the nation\u2019s leading scientists. Here are his words: \u201cAs NIH Director, I\u2019ve followed closely the development of these first vaccines, and I know they have been rigorously tested and found to be safe and effective. I encourage everyone to accept the vaccines when offered to you. It\u2019s our best chance to turn the tide on the pandemic.\u201d I have not \u201cfollowed closely the development of these vaccines.\u201d I do not know the details of this \u201crigorous testing.\u201d But Dr. Collins has, and I am trusting him. And not just him, but all the leading scientific institutions who agree with him on the safety of the vaccine. The FDA, the CDC, and all the major research institutions tasked with knowing about drug safety have assured us that the vaccine is actually very safe. And this overwhelming agreement by experts cuts across political divisions. Bioethics experts from conservative institutions like the Southern Baptist Convention and the Heritage Foundation have all encouraged people to take the vaccine as safe.* In other words, the real question behind \u201cIs the vaccine safe?\u201d is actually the question of trust. The real question is: \u201cDo I trust scientific experts and institutions?\u201d And this means that what is going on for those on the No side is not that they are ignorant, but rather that they distrust the designated experts and institutions. Self-examination for the \u201cNo\u201d side And this is where I invite the \u201cNo\u201d side to do a parallel self-examination. There is a sense on the \u201cNo\u201d side that we are truly independent thinking people who don\u2019t just listen to the authorities tell us how to think. Rather we \u201cthink for ourselves.\u201d But do we? Do any of us actually \u201cthink for ourselves\u201d in a consistent and complete way? When we go to McDonald\u2019s and order a Big Mac, are we inspecting for ourselves whether that particular piece of hamburger comes from healthy cattle, that it has been slaughtered in a sanitary fashion, that it didn\u2019t get contaminated somewhere in the long supply chain? Of course not. Every day, we are willing to inject many things into our own bodies because we trust the underlying institutions that have been tasked with knowing these things for us. We trust not just McDonalds, but a whole system of institutions behind it: its supply chain, government inspectors, the cattle industry, and many, many experts and institutions. Every day, we are all trusting in others. None of us fully \u201cthinks for ourselves.\u201d And here is the key Biblical truth that I want to emphasize: that is a good thing. That is the way God designed human beings and human life to operate. God designed us to navigate the world through trusting others, including trusting institutions and experts. Think about the Old Testament. Yes, some rare individuals get direct access to God\u2019s truth. But the vast majority of people in the Bible have to trust designated leaders: prophets, priests, kings. People have to trust entire institutions like the system of judges Moses appoints, the Levites, the Temple. In the New Testament, Jesus\u2019 all important Great Commission rests on his expectation that the entire world will trust the words of the few he has designated. God has designed human knowledge to access truth about the world through trust. Why did God design human life in the world to operate this way? I suspect God did this as a way to build our trust muscles for ultimately trusting Him. If a person insists on being distrustful of everything and everybody, that person will become a fundamentally distrustful person. A fundamentally distrustful person will have difficulty trusting God. So, trusting in other human institutions is like faith training, building up our trust muscles for God. Of course, trusting human institutions does not mean expecting them to be perfect. Human institutions, like human individuals, have flaws. But just like we have to figure out how to trust imperfect individuals in our lives \u2013 like our spouses, our parents, our friends \u2013 and we also have to learn to trust imperfect human institutions. If you lean on the \u201cNo\u201d side of the vaccine debate, I want to point out that you\u2019ve already learned to trust the very institutions that are telling you the vaccine is safe. Every time you buy some aspirin at the drugstore, you are trusting the FDA who oversees all drug safety. This is the same institution that has approved the COVID vaccine. Every time, you take a family member to the ER at your local hospital, you are trusting the NIH, the institution headed by Francis Collins who oversees health practices. You already trust these institutions for yourself and your loved ones. Please keep trusting them as they tell you that the vaccine is safe. The coronavirus has disrupted our world, caused enormous suffering of all kinds, and killed over 2 million people globally, and over 400,000 Americans. The vaccine is our best chance at ending this suffering and preventing more deaths. But the vaccine does not have all the ingredients necessary to accomplish this. It needs one ingredient that only you can supply: this is the ingredient of trust. Let\u2019s add our part to the solution. *Additional institutions in support of the vaccine include The Center for Bioethics & Human Dignity of Trinity International University, Pontifical Academy for Life, American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American College of Pediatricians; Catholic Medical Association, and Christian Medical & Dental Associations.",

        "text":"Stump: Welcome to Language of God. I\u2019m your host, Jim Stump. This is a podcast about science and faith, and there are no two people who represent these better than Francis Collins and Tim Keller. Collins is one of the top scientists in the world, having led the Human Genome Project and now directing the National Institutes of Health; and Keller is one of the most respected pastors and authors of his generation. Most people who know something about BioLogos know that we were founded by Francis Collins. But fewer people are aware that Tim Keller had an important hand in our success. In the early days of BioLogos, there was a huge amount of suspicion from more conservative Christians about whether the science of evolution could be reconciled with the essentials of Christian faith. Keller has not hidden the fact that he himself has concerns about that. But he thought the conversation was important. So he hosted a series of private meetings in Manhattan where such conversations could take place between prominent faith leaders and scientists. Out of those meetings there was some trust that developed, without which BioLogos would not have been able to gain a hearing. And there was also a lasting friendship that developed between Tim and Francis. In these days of the COVID-19 pandemic, both of them are busier than ever, and we were so thankful they gave of their time to talk to each other and to us about specific challenges the church and the world are facing right now. This was originally recorded as a livestream event on May 18, 2020. A link to the video of that is available in the show notes. Just two days after that event, there was a very exciting announcement that Francis has been named the 2020 Templeton Prize Laureate \u2014 an award given each year to honor someone who has made an exceptional contribution to affirming life\u2019s spiritual dimension. The prize has previously been given to Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama, Desmond Tutu, and Billy Graham, among others. We have links in the show notes to information about that, as well as to other things both Collins and Keller have written for the BioLogos website. At the end of the conversation, we\u2019re joined by BioLogos president Deb Haarsma who offers a prayer for both Collins and Keller. I think this episode gives some fascinating insights into this moment in history from two people who are uniquely positioned to guide us through it. Let\u2019s get to the conversation. Interview Stump: Thank you Tim and Francis. I know being quarantined at home does not mean there are fewer demands on your time. So thank you very much for this time that you\u2019ve given all of us tonight. If we could, let\u2019s just start briefly so the audience can hear that there\u2019s a broader context to this conversation and that you\u2019re not just a couple of random people we paired together. Can you talk a little bit about your relationship with each other, maybe when you became aware of each other\u2019s work, when you met, how you\u2019ve kept that relationship going? Francis, start us off, if you would. Collins: Sure. Well, I knew of Tim as a pastor of Redeemer Church in New York City, which was rather famous for the way it had brought together people from all sorts of different perspectives, including lots of young urban professionals. And I actually dropped in on his church one Sunday morning when I was in New York and was totally inspired by what I saw and what I heard and the deeply thoughtful way in which he approached scripture. And so I approached him probably a few months later. I was in New York for, I think it was the Q conference that was happening, and it was a Saturday I think, and I thought, you know, I\u2019ll just take a chance here and see if Reverend Keller might actually be around, expecting there would be this huge hedge that would be protecting him from the rabble like me. But instead, he was quite available and quite happy to talk. And I guess I probably went straight to my concern about how science and faith didn\u2019t seem to be getting along very well and this seemed like a bad thing for the Christian Church as well as for the scientific community and wondered what he thought about that. And I think he almost immediately bonded about this being a problem that really is vexing the future of the church and maybe we together had a pretty interesting conversation about what we might do about it. Which then ultimately led to a friendship and to involvement by Tim and BioLogos, which has tried, for its very essence to do exactly that\u2014bring scientists and people of faith together and figure out how we can learn from each other and even worship together. Stump: What do you remember of those days, Tim? Was Francis really the rabble that he says he may have been? Keller: No, not at all. I\u2019m sorry to start off our hour by saying that he\u2019s just wrong. I read his book, Language of God, I quote the book in Reason for God, which I wrote in 2007\u2014Language of God came out in 2006\u2014so my memory is that when Francis Collins wanted to see me, I felt honored. So there goes that whole rabble theory. Gone. And so that must have been after both those books were out, Francis. I\u2019m pretty sure. And then the first two or three times that we had conferences, consultations, that basically turned into BioLogos, I was a co-leader of those right here in New York City. And we\u2019ve kept our relationship up since then. Stump: How have you kept up your relationship? I can\u2019t imagine you see each other every day. But? Keller: Well, sometimes we actually have emailed back and forth on issues of human origins where we don\u2019t agree. Collins: There are some. Keller: It\u2019s also true. That it is possible, by the way, to be friends and disagree. I\u2019m also kind of an outlier member of a reading group that Francis is in with other people who are in DC. And occasionally I drop in on that. So that we\u2019ve kept it up somehow. It\u2019s not been easy. Collins: Yeah. And I\u2019ve even occasionally dropped in on your church in New York, if I knew you were preaching, which I guess you do less of these days, but boy, it\u2019s been wonderful to have a chance to learn from you. Stump: Well, let\u2019s move to the topic at hand at hand. This pandemic has radically changed all of our lives. Would each of you share just a bit of how it\u2019s affecting you personally? Tim, you live and work in New York City, the epicenter of this outbreak. What\u2019s that done to your normal rhythms of life at work? Keller: Well, I\u2019m no different than anyone else. It\u2019s been completely disruptive of normal rhythms. Two things I could say about how it\u2019s affected me personally. One is, first of all, my wife and I stayed here. And that\u2019s the first thing and that\u2019s worth talking about. Martin Luther, many years ago obviously, wrote a fascinating piece on whether\u2026it\u2019s Whether One May Flee a Deadly Plague. That\u2019s the name of it. And it\u2019s on the internet, easy to find. And what\u2019s remarkable about it, it\u2019s very biblical and very brave and yet, that his answer is, it depends. May a Christian flee? It depends. He says it is absolutely okay, considering the value God puts on human life, to do what it takes to preserve your own life. On the other hand, if you\u2019ve got a duty of any kind in a place where it\u2019s dangerous, Christians should not flee because they should be not afraid to die. We\u2019re not quite there. On the other hand, I\u2019ve been a leader in the church, I\u2019m not the pastor of any one church now, I work for Redeemer City to City, which helps churches get started in big cities around the world. But nevertheless, I\u2019ve been a leader in the church for 30 years, and it did feel like I should stay. So I\u2019m following Martin Luther. So we stayed, though it\u2019s a dangerous place to be. And nevertheless, we stayed. Number two, we\u2019ve grieved a lot. First of all, there\u2019s a lot of physical devastation here because I work with Redeemer City to City, we\u2019re involved with churches across the city and so many churches, especially in less well resourced neighborhoods, we could say, have really been devastated. There\u2019s one church that we reconnected with that there\u2019s 13 people that have died in it. Then there\u2019s the economic devastation. There\u2019s social devastation. An awful lot of the kids in the schools, where they were already behind in the poor areas, those are the folks that are not keeping up with online, you know, instruction, etc. And so the kids that were far behind or are getting further behind so there\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s grievous. And one last thing to say is, when you go week after week after week without any good news, you\u2019re either reading about the virus or you\u2019re reading about something that\u2019s not the virus, it\u2019s usually bad news, it drains you spiritually. And I can feel it, especially here, where people were rightly concerned about infection because we were in the middle of such a hotspot. So it\u2019s been difficult, even though, you know, God has kept both me and my wife free from the virus and our immediate family most of which lives here have also not been touched. Nevertheless, it\u2019s been\u2026 We stay, we\u2019ve grieved. Stump: How about you, Francis, working in Washington DC and balancing scientific work with public perception and even politics, I\u2019m sure has made a whole other dimension to all of this for you. Collins: Yeah, you could say that. Well, I\u2019m speaking to you tonight from my home office, which is where I have essentially been for the last eight weeks. I have only maybe four times left the house to go to any official duty thing. I\u2019ve been running NIH from this desk right here. All those books behind me are my library on science and faith. And I occasionally have to pull those down to get myself some encouragement. But it is an incredibly intense time because you feel this incredible sense of urgency about marshaling every possible scientific capability, bringing all the bright brains of the planet together and trying to figure out how can we quickly move forward identifying treatments for people who are sick with COVID-19, speeding up the development of those vaccines that everybody\u2019s waiting for, coming up with new ways to do testing that are easier for people to have access to. All of that is right smack in the middle of NIH\u2019s wheelhouse. That\u2019s what we do. We\u2019re the largest supporter of medical research in the world and we\u2019re all hands on deck. But it\u2019s weird doing this through Zoom meetings and conference calls and piles of email beyond anything I could have imagined. And yet trying to keep the momentum going, trying to encourage the morale of my staff who are scattered all over the place, many of them working from home, many of them worried about themselves, their families. And we in our own staff at NIH have had close to 200 people who\u2019ve been infected. Fortunately, most of them done well. But this is very real all around us. It\u2019s not just a scientific adventure. It\u2019s life and death. And I\u2019ve done a lot of scientific adventures, but nothing that quite has this sense of acute urgency. Stump: We last talked about six weeks ago, Francis, in this format, at which time there had been about 10,000 deaths in the US. Now we\u2019re up to almost ten times that many. Is that what you expected of all of this? Or have we flattened the curve or what do we expect from here? Collins: Well, it would have been worse if we had not had Americans do what Americans have been doing, which is to accept those recommendations about staying at home and practicing social distancing and washing their hands and wearing masks now wherever you go outside, not to protect yourself, but to protect other people from you in case you happen to be carrying the virus, and simply by the act of speaking, you may be spreading it around. I\u2019m really impressed with our nation, where people have taken this upon themselves for the most part without having an autocratic government tell them that you have to but doing it because it is the right thing to do. It would have been, I\u2019m sure, much worse had those steps not been taken. But it is still intensely tragic. Those numbers, after a while you\u2019re sort of numbed by them. I look at them every morning because we have a team that meets at 7:30 to see where we are. And every time there\u2019s another 1500, 2000 deaths in America. And it\u2019s heartbreaking to imagine that each one of those represents a terrible tragedy of a lost soul that this virus has claimed. And you sort of feel like we\u2019ve got to do everything we can to try to bend that curve back down. New York has done a pretty amazing job of getting over the top of their curve and coming back down, although they have a long way to go. But a lot of the rest of the country has not actually achieved that yet. And I worry that people are just getting exhausted with this whole business of physical distancing and wanting relief and wanting to be out in the sunshine because it\u2019s starting to be really nice weather. And we still have a terrible risk of another wave of this if we don\u2019t do this in a very careful, sensible way. Stump: Tim, talk about the church\u2019s response a little bit to all of this, the good, the bad, and the ugly, perhaps. What have you seen that makes you proud of the body of Christ? What are some things that perhaps we could be doing better? Keller: Well, I would say you left something out good, bad, ugly. I would say there\u2019s also the non. That is to say I\u2019m not sure on the whole the church has responded yet. There\u2019s been an extremely small percentage of churches that have, you know, defied government directives, and they are because of the publicity they get, there seems to be far more than there really are. And that\u2019s the bad or the ugly. However\u2026after 9\/11 in New York City, where really this was the place where we had the devastation of 9\/11, everybody came together immediately. As a matter of fact, all the churches were jammed. People who never went to church came, and what you were able to do is you\u2019re able to speak words of comfort to the whole community in those churches. We were able to immediately get out there to start to help the unemployed, immediately get out there to give aid to people who had been traumatized. We were able to immediately respond and actually the quarantine means that we actually can\u2019t do what churches do. So in some ways, I would say there\u2019s going to be two periods. There\u2019s going to be the interim period when the lockdowns, the restrictions start to ease up. I call that an interim period where there\u2019s still gonna be restrictions, but there\u2019ll be coming off in stages. And then after that, which is the immediate aftermath, even when the restrictions are gone, let\u2019s say the vaccines out there, there\u2019s going to be all sorts of\u2014well we\u2019re not sure what they\u2019re going to be yet\u2014cultural, social and economic effects that are going to last for a while. And in that situation, basically, and this is an overstatement perhaps but this is how you get people to listen. All churches are going to have to get replanted. See we don\u2019t even know who\u2019s there. When we reconvene, who will be there? I\u2019m a church planter. I planted Redeemer and City to City, the organization I work with, helps new churches get started across the city and it takes a lot of ingenuity. It takes tremendous focus on people outside the church. You can\u2019t ignore them. You have to say what is the needs of our neighborhood? Secondly, it takes a tremendous amount of concentration on what are the needs of people inside the church, you can\u2019t just run programs, you know, and get up there and preach your sermon and draw your paycheck. You\u2019ve got to meet needs inside, meet needs outside, and you\u2019ve also got to be innovative. You\u2019ve got to be thinking about the new situation and how do I maximize opportunities that come from this new situation? How do I minimize the disadvantages? That\u2019s how you plant a church. And unfortunately, I think all churches are going to have to get replanted. And we\u2019re all going to have to say, how do we meet needs inside, outside, and how do we respond to these changes? And that will be a test. So I would say so far 95% of churches have not yet responded. And in the next two periods after this, there will be\u2026it will really be a test. There\u2019s a great chance for witness to the presence of the kingdom and to the reality of Jesus in this time, but it\u2019s also I would say, we haven\u2019t actually met the test yet. Collins: Tim, it must be really tough on pastors though right now who are trying to figure out how to find their role in the midst of such an unexpected crisis and where they can\u2019t even bring people together, they can\u2019t go to funerals and preside and try to provide comfort to the grieving. It must be just unbelievable. You had a piece that somebody pointed me to, a video to pastors, which was intended for them, but I think it spoke to me too, as an encouragement about the things that one might do in this circumstance. And I think you started it off by saying, it\u2019s like when you\u2019re on an airplane and you haven\u2019t quite taken off yet and they\u2019re going through the drill, and they say something about if the oxygen mask falls from the ceiling, put on yours first, before you help the person next to you. Those pastors must be in need of oxygen, because what they\u2019re going through right now must be pretty incredibly intense and exhausting. Keller: Yeah, thanks, Francis. Number one, you might remember from that, I got a phone call three days after 9\/11, I got a phone call from a pastor from Oklahoma City, who had said that after the bombing in 1995, and all the crisis there, the churches and all the ministers went into tremendous overdrive. And about a year later, they all realized\u2014they started going into depression, marriages started to break up\u2014that they had actually burned out. And they didn\u2019t realize the degree to which they\u2019ve been drained. And so what I was trying to say there is\u2026by the way that oxygen mask illustration, my wife who\u2019s probably watching right now, it was her idea to say you\u2019re not going to help anybody else in the plane unless you got your oxygen mask on. And if you burn yourself out, and you die a slow death of despair underneath, while you\u2019re smiling because of course, adrenaline, the great wonder drug, lasts for a while. And then after a while, you just collapse. So you do have to put on your oxygen mask. Collins: Good advice for everybody who\u2019s listening here tonight, whether you\u2019re a pastor, or you\u2019re a parent, or you\u2019re a teacher struggling with not having your students there and trying to make the doggone internet do its purpose for your classes\u2026 Put on your oxygen mask people. You\u2019ve got to take care of yourself as well. Stump: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about vaccines. Collins: Oh why not! Stump: And Francis, I saw an article that you published today with the chief officer at Johnson and Johnson about the need for federal agencies to collaborate with private industry and pharmaceutical companies to develop this as quickly as possible. I\u2019ll ask you if you\u2019ll talk a little bit about that effort. And then, Tim, if you\u2019d chime in at some point here and maybe help us in understanding the church\u2019s reaction to vaccines. That\u2019s certainly painting with too broad of a brush. But maybe we\u2019ll get into talking about some conspiracies\u2026 Collins: Oh good. [laughs] Stump: And how we who call ourselves Christians are particularly prone to this with regard to vaccines, but let\u2019s hear some of the science here first, Francis. Collins: Well, I could go on for hours but you probably don\u2019t want me to, so let me try to put this into a fairly concise narrative. If you want to see this coronavirus pandemic really come to a satisfactory close, a vaccine is by far the best hope we have. But it\u2019s also extremely challenging to make it happen. We\u2019ve never built a vaccine, in all of history, in less than about three or four years. And here we are trying to do it in 12 to 18 months, as Tony Fauci has often said. And maybe even trying to push the envelope a bit on that timetable. So there is an enormous amount of scientific effort going into this with a variety of very novel approaches that have never really been done before for vaccines that are looking pretty good. One that was just reported on this morning, a vaccine that was developed so fast that it was in its first human trials 63 days after the first report of this virus from China. Usually that\u2019s like many months, 63 days, not bad. And the results of that phase one trial, where you\u2019re just checking this out in volunteers to see if it\u2019s safe and whether it produces a good immune response, looks really good. Well, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re there yet. That means you need now to expand that to give this to thousands of people in an area where the virus is currently circulating, to see, did it protect them? If you don\u2019t know that you don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s going to work. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re now moving quickly to try to scale that up to that large scale study. And that\u2019s just one vaccine, there are four or five that are coming along pretty quickly, that all have a different kind of scientific basis, which is good, because probably not all of these are going to work. I just want one of them to work. The other thing we have to do is prepare for the fact that one of them might work and then you\u2019re going to have to scale this up. You\u2019re going to have this huge manufacturing problem, where you need to make hundreds of millions of doses. If you wait until you have the results of the full scale trial, and then start your manufacturing, you just lost several months where people are dying from this disease. So what we\u2019re doing now, thank you taxpayers, is basically to support the scale-up of the manufacturing even before we know what\u2019s going to work. So a lot of that may go to waste, but some of it we are hoping will turn out to be right. I can\u2019t tell you exactly what this timetable will look like. But I will say, particularly through this mechanism we are now invested in and working very closely with no less than 18 companies that are working on this, we are moving faster than humanity has ever seen before. And we\u2019re determined not to worry about who gets the credit, or who makes any money, but just basically let\u2019s get it done and get it out there and try to save people who otherwise are going to be a terrible risk. Stump: Lots of our listeners are asking these questions about vaccines and conspiracies right now. And this is what I\u2019m asking you, Tim, to channel for us a little bit, if you can, the American psyche and all of this, as Rob is asking, \u201cWe\u2019re hearing lots of conspiracy theories, particularly from Christian quarters.\u201d Any thoughts from either of you actually, how do we respond to people like that? And maybe Tim, I\u2019ll give you a little plug here because I\u2019ve been going through your new book that just came out here recently, Uncommon Ground with John Inazu, where you talk about how do we get along with people who think differently than us? You\u2019re not writing about conspiracy theorists in there, but perhaps there\u2019s some wisdom for all of us to take and how we respond to the people on our social media feeds. Keller: Well, let me start by first of all asking, Francis, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m going to scroll back. Francis, would you say the players are by and large showing a willingness to put profits and credit aside? You said that\u2019s what we have to do. We have to not care about who gets credit, not care about who\u2019s making a lot of money. But would you say that the usual suspects are actually doing a good job there? Collins: I think they are. I think they recognize this as a crisis that demands that. I even heard a leader of a pharmaceutical company saying to another rival, \u201cYou know, if your drug actually looks like it\u2019s better than mine, why don\u2019t we use my clinical trial network to expand your drug\u2019s testing, so we\u2019ll really know as soon as possible.\u201d I would not have heard that in any other setting. This is different. Keller: No. What\u2019s what\u2019s good about that, by the way\u2014and I know, I\u2019m not following our moderator here, immediately\u2014but what\u2019s great about that is that is, well, there\u2019s a lot of talk today about the fact that this crisis has not united us. And it is true to some degree politically. After 9\/11 I saw a much more uniting going on than I do this time. And there is a lot of political polarization and it is a problem. Nevertheless, there is some coming together and it might be in the medical pharmaceutical\u2026 If it happens there, then we really can be very, very grateful. That\u2019s all, so. Collins: Well that\u2019s a nice thought. Keller: Yeah, to get back to your question now. You\u2019re struggling to get both Francis Collins and Tim Keller to both say something intelligent about vaccines. [laughs] I don\u2019t know a thing about vaccines! So, but what you\u2019re really asking is, there seems to be something of a real suspicion, well on the part of many, many people, about scientific expertise in this country. And it seems to be particularly acute amongst Christians and evangelical Christians. And I think that\u2019s fair. But let me just say two things. If you were asking how do you reach out to people who are different than you? Well, by both critiquing and affirming, I mean, always. If you just simply say, \u201cYou\u2019re totally wrong,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re totally right,\u201d you\u2019re not actually reaching out. Now, here\u2019s where I want to\u2014and I wouldn\u2019t mind Francis responding to especially this first one\u2014is Christians have got some reason to be wary, not so much of scientists, but of people who come, trying to make a case for something and invoking science. When actually they\u2019re making moral decisions, or philosophical, they\u2019re making philosophical arguments and they\u2019re cloaking it in science. So for example, there really are a fair number of scientists who will take their cultural capital they have a scientist, because science has a lot of cultural capital, because of all the accomplishments, and they\u2019ll say science, not too many, but there will be scientists who will say, \u201cscience proves that there\u2019s no God, that there\u2019s no soul, that there\u2019s nothing beyond this and science tells us these things.\u201d And Francis knows that we could, I\u2019m not gonna mention, we could name, there\u2019s a lot of them right now, that are making a lot of money and books saying science tells us these things. And so Christians look at that and we say, \u201cuh, well what about Francis Collins, I\u2019m sorry, science does not tell you these things and for you to be\u2026\u201d That\u2019s maybe what you might want to call scientism, which is a philosophy that says there is no knowledge other than what can be empirically proven. And there is no, there\u2019s no reality outside of the natural and material. And so when you know that that\u2019s happened, and you there\u2019s a history to that at that. At that point, you know, you can see why Christians will start to get wary of people coming in saying, \u201cwe\u2019ve got this, this agenda and it\u2019s totally scientific.\u201d Actually, the German philosopher J\u00fcrgen Habermas has a great little line, where he says, \u201cscience can tell you what you can do and what you can\u2019t do and how to do it efficiently but science can never tell you whether or not you ought to do it.\u201d That\u2019s always going to be a moral decision. And that\u2019s a matter of faith. And therefore, you really shouldn\u2019t be throwing this on the scientists. The scientists give you the facts. They do give you the facts. But then decisions that we made on the basis of more than just that. And so I can understand that wariness. On the other hand, Christians should know better and here\u2019s where I would push back badly on folks. Herbert Butterfield some years ago, wrote a classic book called the, let me see, I wrote it down here, The Origins of Modern Science. Stump: The Origins of Modern Science Keller: Yeah. Right. And he basically makes his case there that says, you know, Buddhism and Hinduism, didn\u2019t believe the physical world was real. Other ancient pagan views saw the creation always, you can look at their myths, the creation was always a result of some kind of major battle of some kind. You know, nature is basically chaotic. It\u2019s power poles fighting against each other. Along comes Christianity and says, there\u2019s one God, a personal God, who creates the world as an artist, a rational God as it were. And it\u2019s in that soil that science can grow. Because the idea is, oh, there\u2019s nature and there\u2019s a uniformity to nature and there\u2019s an orderliness to nature. And the reality is that Christianity, it was in the Christian West, where the whole idea of modern science grew up because of the view of God. Then you can just go to the Bible and you see, I won\u2019t, I\u2019ve taken too long on this question anyway. You know, Jesus knows the difference between sick people and demonic people, demon possessed people. Jesus does not see all problems as just a matter of demons. He knows that they\u2019re between a physical problem and a spiritual problem. First Timothy, Paul says to Timothy, \u201ctake some wine for your stomach,\u201d which is, you know, medicinal. You\u2019ve got a place in Isaiah 38 where God says, \u201cI\u2019m going to heal you Hezekiah but I want you to put some figs on the boil, and I\u2019ll use medicine in order to do it.\u201d God just didn\u2019t wave his hand and say, okay, you know, I don\u2019t need medicine. I mean, the Bible is just filled with all kinds of reasons to trust science, not scientism, but science. So we ought to push back on the people that are just showing a lack of humility, before a discipline that actually grew up out of Christian soil. But on the other hand, I also want to be sympathetic to the way the use of science to abuse Christians has been\u2026 It has been used. Sorry, that was kind of long, but. Collins: Oh, but it was right on point, Tim. I actually agree with virtually all of that. In fact, one of the motivations for the formation of BioLogos, which is sponsoring this discussion this evening, was to try to counter the sense that the only real voices one could hear about science and faith were on the one hand, the ones you just mentioned who are arguing that science has disproved the need for God and we should just all get over it. And on the other hand, very hard edge fundamentalist views that said, you can\u2019t trust science because it disagrees with my interpretation of this verse or that verse. And most people, I don\u2019t think, really feel very comfortable in those extreme poles, but there wasn\u2019t a lot they could go to in this topic about science and faith. And that is partly why I wrote that book and partly now why BioLogos has come in to sort of occupy, in a wonderful way, that space and make a possibility of civil, loving discourse amongst people trying to sort this out. And it has, I guess, spilled over in the vaccine situation. And it breaks my heart to see why this has become such a nasty situation so often, between people oftentimes quite educated, who have bought into particular conspiracy theories about how vaccines are intended to just make money for pharmaceutical companies and we all know that they\u2019re actually harmful. And the kinds of information that\u2019s spread out there, particularly in social media, that any careful analysis would show is absolutely untrue, but it gets a fire started and it\u2019s very hard to put it out. And it will be very interesting to see, let\u2019s assume we do have a vaccine for COVID-19, maybe as soon as the end of this year, will there be people, even though they have seen others around them suffer and die, who will say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to have that vaccine, it\u2019s probably some kind of conspiracy.\u201d I hope and pray that\u2019s not the case. Because this is not one of those things where people have not had their own experience of seeing what the virus can do. Surely you\u2019d want to take advantage of something that could protect you and your loved ones. Stump: This pushes us into perhaps some deeper theological waters here. Collins: Oh good, now Tim\u2019s going to talk more now, I think. Keller: Pressure\u2019s on me. Stump: Both of you are affirming that in times like these, we should be praying for God to help us and we should also be doing our best to develop vaccines and to figure out appropriate treatments. I think our brains are not wired very easily for \u201cboth and\u201d situations like this. For audiences that seemed to think prayer or science. It seems like we have to go one way or the other. How does this work on a practical level? Tim, maybe what\u2019s God doing? We billed this event tonight as Where is God in a Pandemic? Is God sitting waiting for us to ask him to help him to do something to help the scientists figure this out? Or how do we understand God\u2019s action and God\u2019s work in times like this in relationship to our prayers and to our efforts? Keller: Yeah, and by the way, I want you to know that Francis knows a lot more about theology than I know about medicine. So it\u2019s not quite a flip flop here. Well if you ask the question, where is God in the midst of all this, I mean, you have to start very theologically. And that is Christianity presents the only God that actually comes into this world and makes himself vulnerable, mortal, killable, as it were. He experiences weakness and hunger. He experiences physical weakness, injustice, torture and death. And he does this voluntarily, in order to love us, in order to save us. And because it\u2019s Jesus when he rises from the dead and he goes to heaven. You could say, somebody might say, well, sure, he was in the midst of all of our human suffering, but no longer. Except that when he meets Paul, St. Paul, on the road to Damascus, where Paul gets converted, it\u2019s in Acts chapter nine, he says to Paul, \u201cPaul, Paul, why are you persecuting me?\u201d Now, he\u2019d been killing Christians. But he says, \u201cWhy are you persecuting me?\u201d And Paul says, you know, he\u2019s looking at this glorious divine figure saying, \u201chow in the world have I been hurting you?\u201d And obviously, it means that he is present in this world, particularly among his people, in such a way that he is so connected to us that he actually is still in the midst of the suffering. He still is. And therefore when you ask where is God, if you talk about the Christian God in the midst of the pandemic, he\u2019s right here. Okay, I know what people say. Well why did he allow it to happen? In John chapter 11\u2026I preached on this the Sunday after 9\/11, I always go to John 11. Jesus shows up, Lazarus has died, Mary and Martha immediately start asking, basically asking questions, I mean why did you let this happen? First of all, Jesus does not give an explanation. Now we know what it is because of our\u20262000 years later, we\u2019ve got the perspective, we know why Lazarus died. But at that point, Jesus does not give an explanation. What he actually does is he prays, he weeps, he helps, and he does so sacrificially because the thing\u2026 If you read the passage, the moment he raises Lazarus from the dead, the religious leaders decide that\u2019s the final straw, we have to kill him. So Jesus knows he can\u2019t get, he really cannot get Lazarus out of the grave without putting himself in. So he doesn\u2019t give an explanation. He\u2019s just there in the midst. And he prays and he weeps and he helps and he does it sacrificially. And that\u2019s where we got to where we have to be. Now, here\u2019s the thing, when you see Jesus doing that, without giving an explanation, we don\u2019t know why God\u2019s allowing the pandemic right now. We just know it\u2019s not because he doesn\u2019t love us. And he\u2019s got reasons for why he hasn\u2019t stopped suffering yet. We do know, Romans 8 tells us, someday he\u2019s going to stop all sickness and death, everything. We just don\u2019t know why he hasn\u2019t done it yet. But we do know whatever those reasons are, and he must have good reasons, It\u2019s not because he doesn\u2019t love us. And we should just be following what Jesus said. We shouldn\u2019t be trying to explain why when people ask, \u201cwhy is God allowing this to happen?\u201d no Christian ought to give a good answer. No Christian ought to say, well because of XYZ. They should pray, help, weep, sacrifice and be right near where everybody else is weeping and suffering. Collins: I think that\u2019s beautifully said. I think the other thing is we have to recognize that this is not the most exceptional moment in all of history, even though it may be in our own lifetime. Sometimes I hear a little bit of that reflection that nothing like this bad has ever happened before. Well, goodness, back through human history we\u2019ve had many plagues. Christians have often been at their best in those plagues, by basically doing things that people around them would not do to try to help those who are suffering. And I hope we\u2019re doing that again, in a way that people recognize, although also we need to keep ourselves safe. So yeah, and read the book of Job for heaven\u2019s sake and see whether you think there\u2019s a guarantee that God\u2019s not going to, at times, allow trouble to happen. It happens to us but he promises to be there for us. I have next to my desk a few scriptures that I have, in the course of this pandemic, pulled out and printed up just so that they were close by when I was having one of those moments. And maybe my favorite of all of them is Psalm 46, which most of you will recognize: \u201cGod is our refuge and strength, an ever present help in trouble.\u201d That does not say there will be no trouble. It says, \u201cGod is an ever present help in trouble.\u201d I am really awfully relieved to know that God is here with us in this trouble, each one of us, in ways that can provide comfort and maybe even help us to learn something that we didn\u2019t know before about what humanity is all about and what our calling is, at a time of trouble like this. Keller: Mentioning Job is really helpful, because both Job and Jesus are the two places in the Bible where you see someone who\u2019s an innocent sufferer. Now technically Job being a regular human being isn\u2019t perfectly innocent. Nevertheless, Job didn\u2019t deserve, he didn\u2019t do anything to deserve that suffering. And Jesus when he went to the cross didn\u2019t do anything to deserve his suffering. But because both Job and Jesus were faithful to God without knowing why, but they didn\u2019t turn on God they stayed faithful. Again, Job was shaky. It\u2019s really remarkable to see how shaky he was, but in the end, he holds on. And in both cases, when you experience innocent suffering, and in spite of your questions, you still stay faithful to God, and do what you should do, it defeats Satan. In both cases, Satan is defeated because Satan basically says, \u201coh human beings, they just, they don\u2019t serve you, God, except for themselves. So unless everything is going well in their lives, they\u2019re not going to serve you.\u201d Satan says about Job, \u201cdoes Job serve God for nothing?\u201d Take away things and so what happens in the end if you are suffering even though it\u2019s innocent and you\u2019re faithful to God, you\u2019re defeating Satan. And you\u2019re learning, and you\u2019re also letting the suffering drive you like a nail further into God\u2019s love. And on the other end, you\u2019ll help people and you will actually find that you\u2019re closer to him even though you don\u2019t know the reason why just like Job did not know the reason why. He was never told. So I think Job and Jesus, two innocent sufferers defeating Satan just by being faithful in the darkness is a\u2026.they\u2019re very important models for us. Collins: I hadn\u2019t thought of that. Stump: One more aspect of this I\u2019d like to get you both to comment on is that the suffering seems not to be proportionally spread around in our communities, right? Francis on your NIH Director\u2019s Blog last week, you wrote and interviewed about the disproportionate deaths of minority populations. And I haven\u2019t seen that there\u2019s anything particularly biological to this right? Or is it just a reflection of our societal structures and our systems? And Tim, then I wonder if you might join in about the church and you mentioned Martin Luther\u2019s speech or his letter earlier about how the church may react during these times. Is there anything that the church can do in this particular societal situation we see, where the least of these are suffering more than their fair share in a time like this? Collins: Well, I can certainly say in terms of the bright light that this has shown on the dark situation of health disparities in this country is deeply troubling. We know health disparities are there. People have catalogued them. We know that certain illnesses are more common in people who have less in the way of resources, a lower socioeconomic status and so on. But COVID-19 has been ruthless in the way in which it has attacked those very individuals. In Georgia, where 30% of the population is African American, 80% of the people in the hospital with COVID-19 are African American. And it goes along with the health disparities that diabetes and hypertension are more common in those folks. And we haven\u2019t figured out what to do about that. It goes along with the fact that many of those people are not able to go home and stay at home safely, like I am now. Because they\u2019ve got to get out there and make a living, put food on the table. And so they are not being given the chance to protect themselves. And the consequences are devastating. And I don\u2019t think any of us who care about justice and equity and loving your neighbor can look at this situation and not be deeply troubled. And if this is a wake up call for our country and the way in which health abilities and equities are very unfairly distributed, well good for that. Maybe we need to remember this when the COVID-19 pandemic is over. And right now we need to do everything we can to reach out to those communities especially, even more so than those who have more resources. Keller: Francis just went down the list of\u2026there\u2019s multiple reasons why the less economically resourced communities, for tons of reasons, are being harder hit. They live in smaller spaces. They live closer together. They don\u2019t live just in their apartments. They live around their apartments. They can\u2019t work from home. They also have more underlying bad health issues anyway because of their\u2026for various reasons. So he\u2019s gone through the list. You were asking about the church and that\u2019s a big question. Here\u2019s the reason why. Generally, you\u2019ll see that the upper middle class churches, where maybe the majority of the people can work from home, keep their jobs, versus the more blue collar and poor churches where most of the people are out of work, and where there\u2019s a lot more illness and devastation and unemployment in their immediate neighborhood. One of the problems is that the churches in those hard hit neighborhoods will not have the resources to reach out to their neighborhood at all, because like the majority of their own people are unemployed. The church might close up. They can\u2019t pay the light bills. Meanwhile, the churches that are in more, you know, posh and affluent neighborhoods are not going to have near as many needs in their neighborhood. And therefore there needs to be some kind of partnership between churches with more means, Christians with more means, and the churches in those hard hit neighborhoods, if they\u2019re gonna be able to respond. After 9\/11, we knew that something like, I forget now the numbers it was so long ago, something like 17,000 small businesses south of 14th Street, instantly, literally went up in smoke. And there were hundreds of thousands of folks, many of whom were immigrants, who lost their jobs. And Redeemer was able to go into a major mode of helping people who had lost their jobs. Of course we didn\u2019t have the quarantine, we didn\u2019t have the distancing, social distancing, any of that stuff. Nevertheless, it was partly because people actually sent money to Redeemer from across the country, just saying, we\u2019re very concerned about New York, please help. Basically the situation was New York was much more hard hit the rest of the country was not that affected. People knew about Redeemer, sent us the money and we were able to really do it quite a bit. Something like that is going to have to happen, I think, with the more affluent churches with the churches that are in the harder hit communities if they\u2019re really going to respond to this. Stump: Are there mechanisms that you see that are starting to be put in place that might help to facilitate that? Keller: I hear of them. I better not mention any because I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m, well\u2026 No, I know there\u2019s a\u2026 The game\u2019s afoot, as Sherlock Holmes would say. There definitely are people working on it. Stump: One more question you might both respond to about the image of God. The image of God is one of the most central doctrines of creation and I wonder how does this bear on our conversation here, both on the value of the least of these who are particularly vulnerable to the disease, but then also with respect to our duties and roles toward our fellow humans and the rest of creation, the image of God in us and how that might be imaged to the rest of the rest of the people. Keller: Francis, go ahead, you first. Collins: Well, you could take that in a bunch of directions, couldn\u2019t you? I guess I\u2019m thinking as you raise the question about this debate about is it okay to take some risks about this pandemic by allowing people to be released from where they have been sequestered and quarantined, even if it means there may be more cases happening as a result. But after all, most of those are perhaps the older people or those with chronic illness, or perhaps somebody in a nursing home or somebody who\u2019s homeless, and maybe that\u2019s a trade off that we should basically except because we need to get our economy going again, Christians should be very careful of that one I think. Yes, the image of God applies to all of us. C.S. Lewis said if you could see any one of those individuals for what they really are as a spiritual creature, you would fall on your knees, even those that we consider the least of them. We of all people ought to be full of compassion and concern for every human being. And to consider that any of those might actually be something a sacrifice would be worth taking. That ought to give us a great deal of trouble. Now, I know I sound like one of those public health people who\u2019s not paying enough attention to the economic damage and I don\u2019t mean to say that\u2019s not been horrendous in terms of what it\u2019s done to people\u2019s lives and even caused health issues and even life threatening issues. That\u2019s true too. But let\u2019s be really thoughtful about what we stand for, which is the value of every human life, no matter who it is. Keller: Oh, yeah, listen, I\u2019m just going to build on what Francis said. You know, I think the image of God does stop us from moving into what you might call a hard utilitarianism. Now utilitarianism is a school of ethics, you know, John Stuart Mill, that said, the greatest good for the greatest number. And therefore, if it means sacrificing a smaller number for the good of the whole, that\u2019s fine. Christians can\u2019t go there completely. I mean, when I say\u2026 It seems obvious that if everybody\u2019s in the image of God, then everybody\u2019s in the image of God, including the majority, not just the threatened minority. But nevertheless, it gets you\u2026it does mean that a single life is really very valuable and you really can\u2019t say, you can\u2019t do that hard utilitarianism. A quick example. I know, we probably don\u2019t have time. In 1884\u2014this really happened\u20141884, a British ship called the Mignonette, British, I forget what kind of ship it was, it sunk. There were four survivors and they were in a lifeboat together and they knew that they were not going to be able to survive, probably because they had no food and they were out of the currents, out of the trade winds, unless they were able to, you know, stick it out longer. So three of them killed and ate the fourth guy. Because the fourth guy was an orphan, had no relatives, no parents, no children. He was like 17 or 18 years old. All the others had wives, children, everything. And they sat down in a very utilitarian way, by the way, and said, you know, we\u2019re all going to die, unless he dies, and he doesn\u2019t have any\u2026 You know, basically it was a total utilitarianism. They killed them and ate him. And when they got back, by the way, they went to court and believe it or not the court exonerated them. Because at the time the utilitarian approach to justice was in the ascendancy. I think Christians would say sorry, that was not by his consent, he\u2019s a man in the image of God, has the right not to be killed and eaten. And that\u2019s hard utilitarianism. I still know that there\u2019s a such thing as calculus. Everybody knows, for example, if you shut down all the interstate highways in the country, there\u2019d probably be fewer deaths. And therefore there is some kind of calculus that goes on. It\u2019s at a very high level. But not at the level\u2026I don\u2019t want to do that utilitarianism right now with the virus. So that\u2019s what the image of God does. It does create a bit of a roadblock for people who want to be utilitarian and I would say we can\u2019t go all the way there. Stump: And can you speak at all to the aspect of image of God of people who are in the position to make decisions? What does that mean that we bear the image of God for how we ought to treat people, not just that they themselves are in the image of God, but the duties that are upon us, in times like these. Collins: Well, we are called to be moral creatures, whether we acknowledge that or not, it is a universal sense that all of humanity has. And we recognize there are such things that are good and things that are evil. And it\u2019s a pretty interesting signpost to a creator God who cares about us, by the way. And it is very much on our shoulders to decide how to respond. As we are in the image of God, there\u2019s a lot of weight attached to those decisions. And I know for myself, I fail regularly with those decisions, which then brings me back to why it is a wonderful and amazing and a great comfort that I have Jesus as the Savior, who paid the price for all those times where I don\u2019t live up to the image of God. That makes it possible for me still to be a follower and a believer and to be in relationship with Almighty God, which is an amazing thing to say. Keller: I don\u2019t have anything to add to that. That\u2019s great. Stump: Let\u2019s just close here. We\u2019re going to bring Deb back in. Several of our audience members are even asking how they might pray for the two of you. I think both of you have enormous followings and enormous respect from people that understand the pressures that you\u2019re under. And could you each, maybe just share a couple of specific ways that we could hold you up in prayer and Deb\u2019s gonna pray for us then at the end? Collins: Tim, go ahead. Keller: Well, my part I think, because I\u2019m not the pastor of a church and because I do so many things when it comes to both writing, speaking, mentoring, training, teaching, I\u2019m going to have to replant myself. That is to say I have a lot of leeway as to what I do and I got to have the wisdom to know, in my last years here, because I\u2019m older, what\u2019s the best use of my time? And therefore it\u2019s going to take some wisdom to say what are the new realities and what\u2019s the best way for me to be of service? And actually, I feel quite a burden on that. I don\u2019t feel like I can just chug along do everything I\u2019ve always done. So I would say wisdom to know how to best use my gifts and spend my time in the years I have left. Collins: Wisdom was where I was going too. At a time where there\u2019s so many decisions that have to be made about what\u2019s the right strategy to find answers to this terrible pandemic and I know I\u2019m making mistakes all the time by picking the wrong answer. But I am very fond of that verse from James chapter one, verse 5, \u201cif any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all without reproach, generously, and it will be given.\u201d I am glad that\u2019s the case. Because my wisdom is very insufficient for the challenges we have right now. Haarsma: Well, thank you both for all that you\u2019ve shared with us tonight, and for all of these wise words. And we do want to close here by praying for you, and by praying for all of us in this pandemic. So for every one of you join me in a moment of prayer. Oh Lord, you are the creator. Your love is as big as the universe and you show that amazing love in Jesus Christ. You are the God who became human, who weeps with us and suffers alongside us even to the point of death. Help us to trust that amazing love and stay faithful in the darkness as Job did. Show your love this week to Tim and to Francis. Thank you for their dedication. Keep them safe and healthy. Give them your strength to persevere. And especially give your wisdom as you promised in James, you promised to give wisdom and my ask. Give them wisdom for the urgent challenges of today and the hard decisions for the years to come. Bless each of them as they continue to use their gifts so sacrificially. And Lord we pray you\u2019ll show your immense love to our world. For the sick, bring your healing mercy. Strengthen the health care workers. Guide the researchers. Guide the industry leaders to bring an effective vaccine soon. Into places of sorrow and worry and fear, bring your comfort and presence. Bring your church to show love and compassion. In places of confusion, misinformation and outright lies, bring your truth. Help us to be discerning in how we listen and speak your truth in love. And into places of injustice, where there are not enough resources, where people are suffering more because they\u2019re not able to isolate, bring your church in powerful new ways Lord. May your church be the place that unifies across race and income and geography to care for one another. Show us how to fight for every life, for every community, for every person who bears your image. We continue to pray with Psalm 46, \u201cOh God, you are our refuge and strength, an ever present help in trouble. Therefore, we will not fear. Though the earth give way we will not fear and though the mountains fall into the sea, we will not fear because the Lord Almighty is with us.\u201d Jesus Christ weeps alongside us. In your strong name Jesus, we pray. Amen. Collins: Amen, thank you Deb. Keller: Thank you. Collins: Thanks for a wonderful discussion and a conversation, Tim. Keller: Thanks Francis.

        "title":"Is the COVID Vaccine the \"Mark of the Beast\"?",
        "link":"https:\/\/biologos.org\/resources\/is-the-covid-vaccine-the-mark-of-the-beast",
        "text":"Is the COVID vaccine the \u201cmark of the beast\u201d? If you are not familiar with all the different strands of Christianity, this may seem like a strange question to you. But you may be one of the many Christians who is genuinely concerned about this question, and it is making you afraid of the vaccine. My name is Curtis Chang, and welcome to Redeeming Babel, where our mission is to provide Biblical thinking in a confusing world. In this video, I want to explain why the COVID vaccine is definitely not the mark of the beast described in Revelation 13. I invite you to learn the reasons why I believe this so strongly, because doing so will help you read the Bible with greater knowledge and greater hope. Reading approaches How one answers the question, \u201cIs the COVID vaccine the \u2018mark of the beast\u2019 depends greatly on one\u2019s reading approach to the book of Revelation, the final book in the Bible. The Christians who fear the vaccine being the \u201cmark of the beast \u201c have been taught a particular reading approach: to read Revelation as a prophecy of \u201cthe end times.\u201d I actually grew up with this \u201cend times\u201d reading approach. When I was 10 years old, as a kid in Faith Bible Church in the Midwest, I was given a comic book version of a very popular book among Christians during that time called \u201cThe Late, Great Planet Earth,\u201d written by an author named Hal Lindsey. The book was influential in promoting the \u201cend times\u201d reading approach to Revelation. I remember very vividly the comic book illustrations of the \u201cmark of the beast\u201d passage. The drawing style made the world seem so ominous. I was afraid that some new technology in the world might actually be the \u201cmark of the beast.\u201d I was afraid that I might somehow get accidentally tagged by the mark. I was afraid that the end times were approaching. And I was afraid that the end times would happen before I got my first girlfriend. Seriously, I was really afraid of that! I no longer have those fears because over the years, as I have studied to become a pastor and now a seminary professor, I have learned to read that passage and the entire book of Revelation with a different reading approach. Let\u2019s call this the \u201cfirst century\u201d approach. Now, from my years of study, I do strongly believe that the \u201cfirst century\u201d reading approach is more faithful to the Biblical author\u2019s intentions. However, I\u2019m also aware from my own personal experience how many Christians still adhere to the \u201cend times\u201d reading approach. And like I said, I know firsthand how much of an emotional impression that the \u201cend times\u201d approach can make. If that is true for you, I\u2019d like to invite you to just consider with an open mind the reading approach I\u2019m about to describe. Think of it like this: you\u2019ve been wearing one set of reading glasses. I\u2019m going to offer you to try another set on. If you don\u2019t think my version helps you see more clearly, you can always go back to your old one. When you\u2019re trying on new glasses, it\u2019s helpful to compare them side by side, to switch between the two and see which produces more clarity. I believe this side by side comparison can be characterized by the following: Reading an x-ray versus reading a crystal ball Reading a compass versus reading a map Reading with hope versus reading with fear Comparison #1: Reading an x-ray versus reading a crystal ball Let\u2019s start with the first comparison: Reading an x-ray versus reading a crystal ball Here is the actual passage about the mark of the beast in Revelation 13:16-18: \u201cIt causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name. This calls for wisdom: anyone with decent understanding should calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.\u201d Revelation 13: 16-18 The \u201cend times\u201d reading approach treats this passage like a crystal ball. In this approach, the author of Revelation was thousands of years ago gazing into the future, and predicting that some monstrous institution \u2013 \u201cthe beast\u201d \u2013 would force everyone to adopt some practice, one that is somehow associated with the number \u201c666.\u201d And that event would mark the nearness of the end of the world. Throughout modern history, some Christians have used this reading approach to claim that a particular institution of the day was the beast predicted by Revelation 13. The institution was usually one that the reader was already suspicious of in the first place. When social security was rolled out in the 1930\u2019s to political controversy, some opponents who were Christians labeled \u201cthe beast\u201d as the administration of FDR, and the \u201cmark of the beast\u201d was the assigned social security number. In the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s, when giant telephone companies were seen as part of the shift from agricultural rural life to technological urban life, rural Christians labeled these companies \u201cthe beast.\u201d They said the newly assigned three digit area codes were the three digit \u201cmark of the beast.\u201d The same pattern occurred with large financial institutions in the 1970\u2019s with the roll out of credit card numbers, in the 1980\u2019s bar codes and 1990\u2019s with computers and the Internet, in the 2000\u2019s with RFID technology that can track objects, and so on. And now, it\u2019s happening with the vaccine. The beast is the government, or the CDC, or some other institution. And the vaccine shot itself is the \u201cmark of the beast.\u201d There is even the false rumor that some sort of tracking feature is built into the vaccine. The historical pattern of the crystal ball approach should alert us that something is wrong with this reading approach. With each crystal ball reading throughout the years, the end times does not occur as predicted. The predicted beast ends up not being that horrible. Yet, each generation keeps updating to another prediction, another match \u2013 again, with the match fitting pre-existing suspicions. The Bible actually has very stern warnings about any one who presumes to offer any crystal ball reading. Deuteronomy 18:22 cautions: \u201cIf what a prophet proclaims in the name of the Lord does not take place or come true, that is a message the Lord has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously, so do not be alarmed.\u201d Deuteronomy 18:22 \u201cSpeaking presumptuously\u201d means when someone is imposing one\u2019s own feelings, including one\u2019s own suspicions, on to God\u2019s word. Anyone who tries to read Revelation as a crystal ball is especially risking this judgment of presumption because the author did not write it for this purpose. Reading Revelation as a crystal ball is actually misreading the kind of literature the book is. Revelation is a type of first century literature that as the title suggests, is meant to \u201creveal.\u201d But what is being revealed is not primarily the future, but the spiritual meaning of the historic events happening in the first century world of the original audience. Revelation isn\u2019t talking about \u201cthe end times\u201d for most of the book: it doesn\u2019t get to anything close to that time horizon until the very last chapters. Revelation 1:4 makes it very clear the intended audience: \u201cJohn, to the seven churches in Asia\u2026\u201d Revelation 1:4 The intended audience is the seven first century churches in Western Asia. The next three chapters makes this even more clear as John, the author, reveals the spiritual condition of those seven churches at the time of writing. He is casting a spiritual X-Ray to show them what is really happening in their own congregations. In the ensuing chapters, John then trains this spiritual X-Ray to the wider world. There is nothing to indicate that he\u2019s shifting time frames. He\u2019s just shifting to the secular world, to revealing to first century Christians the spiritual meaning behind those first century world historical events. And this is where the crystal ball approach gets off track: it misinterprets Biblical X-Ray language for what we think is crystal ball language. The type of first century literature that does this kind of X-Ray reading of world events routinely used extreme metaphorical language to describe the underlying spiritual realities. So Revelation is full of passages that describe the sky falling, the mountains crashing, the seas erupting with beasts. If read literally, these passages do sound ominous, like the world is ending. And that\u2019s why some Christians have assumed Revelation is making predictions about some future where the world quite literally ends. It is helpful to remember that even today, we also use extreme metaphorical language to reveal the underlying spiritual or emotional reality behind significant world events. The virus has been described as an \u201cearth shattering\u201d event. The nation \u201cheld its breath\u201d for the presidential election results. Obviously, the virus did not physically break apart the earth\u2019s surface. Obviously, the entire country did not cease to take in oxygen for a week. We have to read Revelation as using the first century version of such metaphorical language to reveal the spiritual and emotional realities of their first century world events. Since most readers aren\u2019t familiar with first century metaphors or first century historical events, we should approach Revelation with a trusted and accessible Bible commentary. I personally recommend N.T. Wright\u2019s Revelation for Everyone. Wright is probably the leading Bible scholar of the day and yet he writes in an extremely accessible and succinct fashion in this book. Also, our friends at The Bible Project have some excellent videos on this topic (and they\u2019re much less scary than my Hal Lindsey comic book!). Comparison #2: Reading a compass vs. reading a map Even though I believe that Revelation cannot be read as a crystal ball, I can understand the attraction to this approach. The crystal ball approach \u2013 even if it is mistaken in my view \u2013 is nevertheless a way of making Revelation relevant to us today. If one only reads Revelation as revealing the spiritual meaning of first century world events, then what\u2019s the point of us reading it today? This gets to a second reading comparison. To explain this difference, I\u2019m going to change metaphors a bit. I believe we have to read Revelation as a compass versus reading it as a map. When we are reading a map like this \u2013 and I realize that those of you under the age 20 may have never glimpsed such an object like this \u2013 we are making a one to one equation. This dot equals this specific town and this town only. This line equals this specific road and this road only. If we want to read Revelation as a map making one to one equations, we have to do so with the first century world. We can do that with precision in the mark of the beast passage. It is historically documented that the first century Christians were under enormous pressure to conform to a growing practice of worshipping the Roman emperor. You can draw a one to one equation from \u201cthe beast\u201d to the Roman emperor: it was common for Scripture to use the metaphorical language of beasts to reveal the dehumanizing and vicious spiritual reality behind pagan rulers. Revelation makes that equation even more obvious by identifying the mark of the beast as 666. There was a common code in first century Hebrew literature that identified letters to numbers, and in that code, 666 translates precisely into the word \u201cNero\u201d \u2013 the specific Roman emperor of that day. So, read as a map, the passage clearly wants the first century Christian to avoid bowing down to Nero and getting too closely identified with him. The language about getting branded with \u201c666\u201d is the metaphorical way of saying: beware that everyone in the first century world doesn\u2019t brand Christians politically. Make sure that everyone doesn\u2019t just assume Christians worship Nero like the rest of the pagan world. Now, if we want to discern the relevance of Revelation for our world today, we have to read the text differently. We have to read it like this thing: like a compass. A compass does not make one to one equations to a previously mapped world. Rather, a compass equips you to navigate your path in what may be an unfamiliar world. A compass gives you an orientation, a way to make your way in the world now before you. And a compass orients you by pointing you to the True North. Now, the two ways of reading \u2013 a compass and a map \u2013 are related. As we read Revelation as a map, we are seeing how the Biblical author was guiding the first century Christian church. We can trace God\u2019s intended route for them. The more we follow those first century routes, the more we end up with a compass, \u201cOh so, that is how God wants his people to navigate the world in general.\u201d So, let\u2019s try to turn Revelation 13 from a map into a compass. We should beware of any one to one connection that confidently equates \u201cthe beast\u201d or \u201c666\u201d to any current political leader or current political identification. But we can read this passage as a kind of general orientation for Christians on how to navigate politics in our world. Here\u2019s my reading of the passage as a compass: I believe it is telling Christians in general throughout all ages, to navigate their political world by avoiding any complete and total identification with any political leader or party \u2013 whether on the Left or the Right. Don\u2019t bow down to any one leader. And as Christians, don\u2019t let yourself get politically branded, such that being a Christian automatically equals being a member of a particular political party \u2013 whether on the Left or the Right. That\u2019s my version of reading Revelation 13 as a compass. You may of course discern your own version. I\u2019m sharing mine simply to offer an illustrative example of what is an appropriate way to rely on Revelation to navigate our current world. Christians can differ on the specifics of how different Biblical passages operate as compasses. But what all Christians should agree on is the True North. The most important way that a compass guides navigation is by pointing you to True North. And this leads to my final comparison. This is reading with hope versus reading with fear. Comparison #3: Reading with hope versus reading with fear Like I said, the end times reading approach made me afraid of many things for many years. The tragedy was that causing fear is the exact opposite intention of Revelation. If you read passages like Revelation 13 as a compass, they are pointing to the final chapters of the book. This is when the book does shift its time horizon to the end. But it is the end, not of the very existence of the world, but rather the end of its struggles and suffering. The final chapters of Revelation depict what has always been the Biblical picture of Christian hope for the world. Revelation 21:2-4 states it beautifully: \u201cAnd I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, \u201cBehold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. 4 He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.\u201d Revelation 21:2-4 Notice that the end is God coming down from heaven to earth to be with humans and restore humanity. The end is not some devastating series of events. The end is not the destruction of the world. The end is the return of God \u2013 in the person of Jesus \u2013 back to this world. To dwell with us, to wipe away every tear, to end death and suffering. This is our true North Star. This is the future that gives us hope for this world. Reading Revelation all the way to the end assures us that even when it seems like the world right now is captive to tears, death, and suffering, that is not the final state. As Christians, we have every reason to live as people of hope, not fear. Final appeal The priority of hope over fear is the reason why all Christians should stop fearing the mark of the beast. Even if you want to stick with an end times reading approach to Revelation, you should avoid interpretations that create fear in you. This is because all Christians have been given something even better than a reading approach. We\u2019ve been given a personal reading guide. This personal reading guide is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is like a tutor at our side when we read Scripture, telling us, \u201cNo, don\u2019t read it this, read it that way.\u201d And how do you know when you are reading with the Holy Spirit\u2019s active guidance? 2 Timothy 1:7 makes this clear: \u201cFor God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.\u201d 2 Timothy 1:7 A Spirit guided reading leads you away from fear. Fear makes you feel powerless, suspicious (which is the opposite of love), and out of control. But the Holy Spirit seeks to give us a feeling of being empowered, being loved, and that things are under control. Most of all, the Holy Spirit points you to the True North, to the reassuring promise that our God will one day end suffering, disease, and death itself. This is why I believe that if you want to locate the vaccine in Revelation, don\u2019t equate it one to one with the mark of the beast. Rather, locate the vaccine as a hopeful pointer, a compass indicating God\u2019s promise that he himself will return one day to end all suffering and death. The vaccine of course is just a pointer \u2013 it itself won\u2019t end all suffering and death for good. Only God\u2019s return to earth can do that. But pointers give us hope, they give us some indication of what is to come. The vaccine has the potential to do just that: to give us hope, to give an indication that there is an end to suffering and death. Let\u2019s follow that pointer. Let\u2019s be people not of fear, but of hope.",

        "text":"3. The sooner the better Widespread vaccination is the fastest and most permanent way to stop the spread. Nearly half a million people in the United States have already died of COVID-19 and millions more have been sick. Many others are struggling\u2014those who\u2019ve lost jobs, the lonely, those suffering mental illness, the healthcare workers serving on the front lines, and the teachers and kids dealing with online school. All of this will end as soon as we stamp out this virus! You can help your community by getting the vaccine as soon as you are eligible. 4. COVID-19 vaccines are ethical Many Christians are concerned about the possible use of fetal cells in vaccines. The good news is that no vaccines contain human cells! Moreover, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do not use human cells even in the production process. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine does use a human cell line in production; this is an immortal cell line that came from a fetus aborted in 1985 (the abortion was not performed for this purpose). Yet even here, the cells used today are descended many generations from the original fetus and were never part of an actual human body. While the association with abortion gives many Christians pause, there is substantial agreement among Christian theologians and ethicists that the connection to fetal cell lines should not make these vaccines off-limits for Christians; see our Common Question on vaccines for more. 5. The disease is riskier than the vaccine No vaccine is 100% risk-free, just as no medical procedure is risk free. Christians need to weigh the risks on both sides. COVID-19 is a serious disease, much worse than the flu. By now we\u2019ve all known people who have had it. Some people have mild cases but others have serious symptoms, hospitalization, and long-term complications. The risks of the vaccine are less than the risks of the disease. Our Common Question on vaccines weighs the risks in more detail.",

        "text":"BioLogos has invited dozens of Christian leaders to say this publicly. The statement shows the biblical basis and broad Christian support for taking the scientific findings about COVID-19 seriously in the present moment. Now, we as signers certainly don\u2019t agree on everything. We come from different political parties, different theological traditions, different racial and ethnic groups, different generations, and different parts of the country. We aren\u2019t trying to agree on public policy or what schools should do this fall. Such decisions require many considerations besides science; \u201cscience\u201d is not a one-word rationale for public policy. But we agree that the core scientific findings are valid and should not be rejected. We know all truth is God\u2019s truth, including the truths that biomedical researchers are discovering about the virus, how it spreads, and how to fight it. An individual scientist may be biased, but many scientists check each others\u2019 work and develop good protocols to give solid results. It\u2019s not a perfect process and one can always find dissenters, but scientists working together are far more accurate than one person\u2019s theory on YouTube. We are deeply concerned that many Christians are skeptical of well-established findings and not acting on them, at a time when thousands of lives are at stake. Because of our faith in Jesus Christ, we are committing ourselves to stand for the truth (1 Cor. 13:6) and to love our neighbors. Because of Jesus\u2019 command to care for \u201cthe least of these\u201d (Matthew 25:31-36), we are wearing masks and promoting vaccination. Because of God\u2019s passion for justice, we are caring not just for ourselves, but for the communities hardest hit by the pandemic. And we are committing to pray. To pray for the sick and the grieving. For elected leaders. For parents and teachers. For doctors and nurses. For researchers developing treatments and vaccines. And we pray for our cities and nation; may God bring healing, justice, and flourishing for all (Jeremiah 29:7). Will you join us? Please read the statement and prayerfully consider signing it. If you sign it, be sure to send it on to others and encourage them to do the same. As Christians, let us come together in unity, truth, and love in these pandemic times, and thus be a stronger witness to the world. They will know we are Christians by our love (John 13:35).",

The new 4000-square-foot Pierre Chevet Sports Center, just outside Paris, is France\u2019s first government-sponsored hempcrete building.

Additionally, hempcrete is virtually fireproof and stronger than concrete, even though it weighs about an eighth of what concrete weighs, making it easier to work with. Hempcrete is cheaper than wood, and would be cheaper than concrete too if governments didn\u2019t require special permits to grow it\u2026 especially since the planet is running out of sand thanks to all the concrete buildings.

Be sure to get the TRUTH by subscribing to our email list. It\u2019s free. Editor\u2019s Note: This article was originally published in the August 2022 edition of the TTAC Insiders Newsletter. I am honored to have the opportunity to contribute to TTAC\u2019s important work. I have benefited personally from TTAC\u2019s work on cancer, vaccines, and propaganda. Given my family history of vaccine injury, COVID and its hyped \u201cvaccines\u201d did not come as a shock. It was not hard to see that rushed experimental vaccines, with even less liability than licensed vaccines, were a disaster in the making. I knew about the horrific side effects and illnesses associated with vaccines\u2014the corrupt practices between regulators and industry\u2014and the fact that the corporate media and medical system would do the captive regulators\u2019 bidding. But there were major new wrinkles in the last two years. We\u2019d never seen such pervasive mandates by employers, schools, theaters, and restaurants\u2014particularly mandates of an emergency use authorized product that cannot be compelled under federal law. We\u2019d never seen such a media blitz\u2014not even the H1N1 swine flu or measles scares compared. And I\u2019d never heard such extraordinary lies about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, about the dangers of alternatives like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, about the numbers of cases and deaths, about the benefits of lockdowns, masks and testing. Even for those like myself who had been in the health freedom movement for years, the COVID nightmare was remarkable for its sheer enormity: the globally coordinated efforts to induce the whole global population to participate in a medical experiment. Although I considered myself reasonably well educated about vaccines before March 2020, having co-authored two books and many articles, my learning curve since then has been steep. I had not appreciated just how deeply involved governments worldwide had become in establishing a new biosecurity paradigm and how assiduously they had rehearsed pandemic exercises for decades. After watching Event 201, the coronavirus rehearsal that took place in October 2019, I learned that this was but one of a series of tabletop exercises for global leaders where the conclusion to solving a medical emergency always ended in the loss of human rights. Professor Paul Schreyer\u2019s video Pandemic Simulation Games\u2014Preparation for a new era? on the history of these simulation exercises was a revelation. Similarly, although I had learned something about ID 2020 and the desire to track every person on the planet, I had not appreciated the critical intersections between digital IDs or vaccine passports, central bank digital currencies, the World Economic Forum\u2019s \u201cGreat Reset\u201d and social credit scoring. James Corbett, Catherine Austin Fitts, Truthstream Media, John Titus, Corey\u2019s Digs, and others helped me piece together these parts of the puzzle. Working on CHD Films and Andy Wakefield\u2019s recent documentary, Infertility: A Diabolical Agenda, forced me to accept as a fact that the World Health Organization and parts of the U.S. government have been working on a depopulation agenda in the developing world for decades. As this vivid film depicts, the WHO designed and developed a vaccine to cause infertility in women under the guise of a tetanus vaccine and deceitfully deployed it in Kenya and elsewhere to sterilize women without their knowledge or consent. Forced sterilization, which the WHO clearly undertook, is a war crime under the treaty for the International Criminal Court. And now we are seeing a staggering death toll from the COVID shots emerge from scientific articles, VAERS data, insurance data, and reports of sudden unexplained deaths. This is a dystopia in real life. We are living a nightmare that global leaders taunt is far from over. President Biden says \u201cthere\u2019s going to be another pandemic.\u201d Likewise, WHO Director-General Tedros warns that the next plague could occur very soon. And the WHO, with the U.S. in the lead, is attempting to create a treaty giving itself unimaginable powers to declare and police pandemics worldwide as the fulcrum for a new global order. And yet\u2026the COVID paradigm is a bridge too far. Humans who want to stay human vastly outnumber the predatory cabal bent on the Fourth Industrial Revolution, with its blurring of the lines between human and machine, artificial intelligence, and the promise of a new global order with truncated individual rights. Make no mistake, despite all the bluster and ballyhoo, the predatory regime is crumbling: The U.S. government is throwing out unused stocks of COVID shots, 70% of U.S. citizens are not following CDC guidance to get all their shots and boosters, by any mainstream media definition this would make 70% of Americans anti-vaxxers; and only 18% of parents polled say they plan to give their children under 5 the shot. It\u2019s becoming clear that the shots don\u2019t work but rather kill and maim people. America\u2019s doctor himself, Dr. Fauci, got sick with COVID after 2 doses, 2 boosters, and Pfizer\u2019s patented Paxlovid. And despite the remarkable suppression of information about COVID deaths and injuries in the media, people talk; people see and hear their neighbors and family members speak about illness and death after COVID shots. As President Lincoln famously said, \u201cYou can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time but you can\u2019t fool all of the people all of the time.\u201d Trying to use this playbook a second time for \u201cthe next pandemic\u201d\u2014monkeypox or another infectious disease\u2014is simply a collapsed bridge. It won\u2019t work. While the same kinds of calamities have been occurring worldwide in the childhood vaccine program for decades, they were on a smaller scale; they didn\u2019t affect everyone around the globe all at once. Instead, those injured were isolated and gaslighted, the media disparaged and ridiculed the families, and the courts were closed. But now, billions have been directly and simultaneously affected by this man-made catastrophe. People are talking on social media, at rallies, at family gatherings, and in growing organizations like CHD. And even the mainstream media is starting to talk about vaccine injury, cautiously, but it is acknowledging injuries and deaths and the fact that there is no functioning compensation system for those harmed. And although there have been few grand slams, courts around the world are open and hearing cases related to vaccines\u2014the mandates, the exemptions, the suppression of treatments, the ingredients\u2014more than ever before. A few of the legal victories to date include: A Supreme Court decision to invalidate the mandate for companies with over 100 employees A Supreme Court decision to invalidate the CDC\u2019s suspension of housing evictions A Florida federal court\u2019s decision to lift the mask mandate in transportation A Texas federal court\u2019s decision to require Pfizer to release the documents it provided to the FDA for licensure of its COVID injection The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision to lift the COVID mandate for federal workers pending a hearing of the full panel of 17 judges An injunction against Washington, D.C. Minor Consent Act, allowing children as young as 11 to \u201cconsent\u201d to COVID and other vaccinations without parental knowledge or consent The Louisiana Governor\u2019s retraction of a school COVID mandate in light of pending litigation An Indian Supreme Court decision holding that the COVID shot may not be mandated An Uruguayan court\u2019s decision to withhold all COVID vaccines from children unless Pfizer answers tough questions and produces material documents An Austrian court\u2019s requirement that the Health Minister answer tough questions about a universal COVID mandate, which led to the mandate being shelved, among others During the last two years, I\u2019ve learned that courts follow culture. Judges are a cautious lot. Even when the law would permit them to make bold decisions against the government or corporate actors, they are often reluctant to do so. But as culture fast approaches the tipping point to say \u201cWe will not take this anymore!\u201d, judges are becoming bolder. I expect we will see more judicial decisions finding that government actors\u2014the FDA, CDC, NIH, Governors, and Mayors\u2014have exceeded their authority. We\u2019ll see more revelations about pharma fraud and government collusion. We\u2019ll see more winning cases on religious exemptions and mandates, as consensus science now acknowledges that the shots do not stop transmission or infection thus eliminating any legitimate rationale for mandates. If there is a change in control in the House of Representatives in January 2023, as is usually the case in midterm elections, we could see serious hearings about what has gone down since March 2020, and we could learn who knew what and when. We could see Congress lead investigations using its subpoena power. These hearings could culminate after a few years in tectonic political shifts, leading to legislative changes to end pharma\u2019s blanket liability protection, end conflicts of interest between industry and the FDA, CDC, and NIH; end direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising, and end usurious drug prices and taxpayer-funded pharma disasters. In short, with the sea change in public opinion that is likely in the next two years, massive changes await. Children\u2019s Health Defense is at the heart of the global effort to create the parallel world we will need as the existing power structures fail. With activities in science, education, advocacy, and litigation in CHD chapters around the world, we are creating the change we want to see; and shining a bright light on what\u2019s not working brings us hope to fix what\u2019s broken. Klaus Schwab recently told his buddies at the Davos 2022 Summit \u201cThe future is built by us.\u201d No, Mr. Schwab, the World Economic Forum does not build the future; we the people worldwide build the future.",

They are both recovering in the hospital and doing well. Please keep them both in your prayers as they continue to recover and heal. Carrie has been a good friend to us and is a hero in the world sounding the alarm about the COVID shots and the transhumanism agenda the globalists are rolling out without our express knowledge through the COVID shot. If it weren\u2019t for Dr Carrie and others like her, we would be in the dark about the science and ingredients and their very dangerous effects on the human body. Thank you, Carrie, for your service to humanity. Please enjoy this video presentation of Dr Carrie Madej speaking at our most recent TTAC Live Event 2021 in Nashville, Tn where she talks about \u201cThe COVID-19 Injections \u2013 A Gateway to Transhumanism?\u201d VIDEO TRANSCRIPT Ty Bollinger: Our afternoon keynote speaker was originally from Dearborn, Michigan. She received her medical degree from Kansas City University of Medical Biosciences. She then completed her traditional internship at The Medical Center in Columbus, Georgia, and internal medicine residency at Mercer University in Macon, Georgia. She served as a private clinician and medical director of multiple clinics in Georgia till 2015, also served as an attending physician for the Pennsylvania College of Osteopathic Medicine. Charlene Bollinger: She has served as a public speaker and has been featured in the documentary The Marketing of Madness about the overuse of prescriptions psychotropic medicines, and she has now dedicated her life in educating others about vaccine, nanotechnology, and human rights. She\u2019s become a good friend. I\u2019ve spoken with her on a few different occasions. She\u2019s a dear, dear soul, and I personally am looking forward to hearing our good friend, Dr. Carrie Madej. Ty Bollinger: Give it up for Carrie Madej. Dr. Carrie Madej: Thank you so much. It\u2019s so exciting for me to be here today. I\u2019m going to talk about obviously some ugly things that are happening in our world, but remember that we need to be wise as serpents and gentle as doves. And people get scared of the word apocalypse, right? But we shouldn\u2019t because literally the word apocalypse means lifting of the veil. We are seeing now what has been unseen. These ugly things that are going on right now are for a purpose. It is for us to finally remember who we are and what we are. It really is about returning back to who we are, which is we have a royal birthright, a divinity right with God, Yeshua, our savior. Dr. Carrie Madej: So, transhumanism. If you don\u2019t know this word, you need to know it. Everybody in the world should know this because it is my belief that these injections they falsely call vaccines are the gateway to transhumanism and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going through this chaos. You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free, right? So let\u2019s get started. Dr. Carrie Madej: The most important question you should ever ask yourself is what does it mean to be human? Because right now, the future of humankind is at stake. They want to turn us into something called human 2.0, and I personally am against it. So you need to know what is going on. So Ray Kurzweil, he\u2019s one of the big wigs of Google, he\u2019s a transhumanist. He says, we are all, not just a couple of people, we are all going to be a hybrid. This is the most pivotal point in human history. We are alive for this time. And I know I was born here to be for this moment, weren\u2019t you? Dr. Carrie Madej: So, transhumanism. What is that? That is literally the melding of artificial intelligence with the human body. Sounds pretty sci-fi, but it\u2019s doable and possible if we allow it to happen. It\u2019s also about manipulating the human genetics, that God-given code. So just so you know how precious your genome is, it is in one person, if you unraveled it, it would extend out to 10 billion miles, one human being. That is a wonderful living language. You can read it like a book. It can actually be read as a binary code. Dr. Carrie Madej: And so people now in this transhumanist field, they believe that the human body is broken and fragile. We\u2019re going to fix that. We\u2019re going to take evolving humanity into our own hands. These people right now think that and they are executing their plan. So this says scientists propose putting nanobots in our bodies to create a global super brain. Isn\u2019t it selling something from the worst sci-fi movie ever? We\u2019re living it right now, guys. So you can\u2019t get distracted by what the television is telling you. It\u2019s tell a vision. It\u2019s programming you. Turn it off, never turn it back on again and you will become smarter already. Dr. Carrie Madej: So again, Ray Kurzweil, we all know this man. He says, we\u2019re just a few breakthroughs from achieving eternal life. Again, what these people are doing, listen, they are atheists. They do not believe in God our Father in heaven. They will tell you that. Even Ray Kurzweil says, somebody asked him, \u201cIs there a God?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, but soon there will be one.\u201d Craig Venter, another transhumanist, they asked him, \u201cWhat is God?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, God creates. Now, I can create, we can create. Now we\u2019re gods.\u201d You need to know those are the pushers of this agenda. They are the pushers of these injections falsely called vaccines. Dr. Carrie Madej: So you have to know what they plan. They have a plan for human bodies as you can see here, avatar A, B, C, D. So this is an evolution of going up to 2045. They actually kind of pushed this agenda to 2030, eight years from now, guys. So they want to actually\u2026 They think a human being is only memories and dreams. That\u2019s it. Because again, they don\u2019t believe in God. So they think if they upload all of our memories and dreams into the cloud, then they can download them into a new body or robots or a digital avatar like a video game. You have to know what they\u2019re thinking. I know it sounds ludicrous, but you need to know. Dr. Carrie Madej: So who else is behind this? World Economic Forum, Davos. And if you really want to know what they\u2019re planning, look at the World Economic Forum\u2019s websites. So this is what they\u2019ll tell all of us that 2030 is their goal, guys. So in 2030, it says the average human will own nothing, have no privacy and life has never been better, right? They also say on the bottom paragraph here, they\u2019re giving you the description of now, this is their best sell. They\u2019re marketing this to you, okay? They say that in the future, everywhere you go will be registered, there\u2019s no privacy, and every thought and every dream is recorded and monitored. And you hope that none of those dreams, none of those thoughts go against the narrative or you\u2019re in trouble. You will be in trouble for what you dream of. These are these megalomaniacs behind this plan. They plan this for the future of humankind. Dr. Carrie Madej: So these are very outrageous ideas. So how in the world could they accomplish this really almost eight years now? So you have to know about DARPA. Very important organization to know, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. They\u2019re the black ops, the sci-fi kind of portion of the Pentagon. They have public and private funding. And so one of the things you need to know is this substance called hydrogel. Hydrogel is like the mother kind of formula. It\u2019s a sci-fi substance that can do many things. Actually it\u2019s very analogous to the human tissue. So we usually don\u2019t reject it in the body. It can assemble, disassemble, reassemble innumerable times. It can make more of itself in your body. It can meld with the human tissue and be a hybrid with your body, your brain, and your nervous tissue. They\u2019ve used it in military projects already. Dr. Carrie Madej: So just so you know, an example of that would be, there is a small group of Black Hawk helicopter. It was a project. And when they sat in the aircraft, they\u2019d have to wear a magnetic helmet. And at that moment, all their eye movements and everything they thought, the aircraft would know immediately to do in respond. The aircraft and the person, the pilot was one. And if they had an upgrade, they didn\u2019t have to study. They just sat in the cockpit and then it was downloaded into their brain. They\u2019ve been doing this for decades. So Neil deGrasse Tyson, he\u2019s an astrophysicist, is talking to Ray Kurzweil, the guy we\u2019ve been talking about. So listen to what he says. Neil deGrasse Tyson: In 20 years, plus or minus, and so the mid 2030s, we will have nanobots that we can feed into our brain that directly connect to the cloud rather than through anything we carry in our pocket. And in that way, wirelessly, we can basically download entire books, entire languages, and we will then know the\u2026 Dr. Carrie Madej: I\u2019m sorry. All right. Sorry, that cut off a little early, but you\u2019re talking about nanobots. So hydrogel, that magical substance can form nanobots. It can be a drug delivery system. It can be biosensor. It can be a biosensor in your body. So how in the world could they get nanobots in our body? How could they upload everything? How could they know our thoughts? How could they know our dreams? How could they monitor everything? How could this happen? Because they\u2019re doing it right now through these injections falsely called vaccines and they\u2019ve been lying to us from the beginning. Dr. Carrie Madej: So it is not a vaccine. Never call it a vaccine ever again any of these shots they\u2019re giving to anybody, all right? It\u2019s a brand new technology on the human race. It\u2019s nothing like an old vaccine. Old vaccine takes the actual virus and it\u2019s dead or alive with some toxins, puts it in your body, and your body\u2019s supposed to know how to fight it just a little bit amount, right? No, there is no virus at all that they have documented. There\u2019s over 70 freedom of information acts. Do you know we don\u2019t have the virus on file anywhere in the world? Nobody has it in their lab. This is a little crazy, right? So they couldn\u2019t make the normal way. They had to make a Frankenstein code so that your body produces this. They took proteins, they took this genetic code and mashed it together and had an artificial intelligence program fill in the missing gaps. So it\u2019s artificial intelligence, a synthetic thing that\u2019s not from nature and different kinds of parts of genetic material pushed into one and they are programming your body to make it like a factory. Dr. Carrie Madej: What\u2019s in the code? We know a little bit. We know that there\u2019s a human protein similar to the body so your body potentially could start attacking itself. It\u2019s so similar. Like autoimmune disorders. HIV-1, did anyone know that? Is that informed consent here? 18 sub-units of HIV-1 are in that code that your body will be producing. What will that do? Chromosome 8 is pretty important. It\u2019s in charge of intelligence and fertility. It\u2019s a potential damaging that. Most important, they\u2019re putting a fake amino acid in your body, not from this world. That beautiful symphony orchestra of how your body is created with that genome that twist and turns, it\u2019s beautiful from God, they\u2019re destroying it with a fake protein. It\u2019s like origami. It won\u2019t twist and fold together again. Dr. Carrie Madej: This guy you need to know, Dr. Craig Venter. Never forget that name. This man is behind this transhumanist movement. He\u2019s the brains behind it. And I want you to know that if we have a synthetic gene, which this vaccine has\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, injection has synthetic genes in it, if it gets taken up into our human genome, that\u2019s bad because in 2013 in this country, the Supreme Court justice has ruled that any human being can be patented and owned if there\u2019s a synthetic gene inside of them. What? Did you know that? Was that on your CNN, your Fox News? No. Literally overnight, you can be patented and owned. This guy is partly responsible for this. Dr. Carrie Madej: So they didn\u2019t want you to know there was a synthetic gene inside this injection because it\u2019s possible for it to take up into your body. And if it\u2019s taken up, they decided to get credit for their work. They\u2019re so proud of this. Again, they think they\u2019re little creators. They\u2019re gods, right? So they\u2019re putting their names branding you like a cow. 46 scientists are doing this. They\u2019re getting a secret email inside the genome. I guess that\u2019s who you belong to if someone finds you. Also three messages. Can\u2019t figure out those messages yet. Working on that. And also a brand new alphabet. Why alphabet? Dr. Carrie Madej: Remember they want to be gods or copying God, but it\u2019s a blasphemy, an inversion of God, okay? They want you to live forever. They want you to always be connected through a hive mind. And also we\u2019re connected with God, right? So frequencies. Like you\u2019re tuning on a radio, they want to switch the channel. They want to switch the station because words are powerful. Remember in the beginning there was the word. Yeah. It\u2019s powerful, guys. See what they\u2019re doing? We know what they\u2019re doing, right? So they\u2019re not going to get away with it. Dr. Carrie Madej: And so this is going back to, yes, the Supreme Court has ruled that a human being can be patented and owned if this synthetic gene gets taken up into your body. And they\u2019re telling us it can\u2019t happen. Absolutely it can happen. They\u2019re lying to you. Absolutely. Right here, this is the modified messenger RNA that they\u2019re using inside of these injections, and this is just one of many research articles showing that our body has the potential to use reverse transcriptase enzyme. Long word. It can take it up into the genome of our genome and then it becomes permanent. It\u2019s a Russian roulette. It\u2019s a chance. It\u2019s like playing Craps. We shouldn\u2019t be doing that with our sovereignty, with our human holy temple, right? Dr. Carrie Madej: So Moderna and Pfizer. So everybody tells me, \u201cOkay, I know some of those injections are bad. Okay. Well, what about this one? What about this one?\u201d No, they\u2019re all bad, guys. They\u2019re all putting a fake code inside of your body. Something not from nature that you are producing like a factory. And you know how they\u2019re doing that? They have to suppress your immune checkpoints. They have to suppress your immune system so your body accepts it. For how long will that happen? That means more cancers, more autoimmune disorders, all kinds of things. Do you think they cared? No. They just want their drug inside of your body. Dr. Carrie Madej: They also are putting artificial intelligence inside your body. Unbelievable. But it\u2019s just to get the drug delivery system in. So the hydrogel is part of this artificial intelligence system. And they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, well, we\u2019re not going to use it for bios and we\u2019re not going to do it to spy on you. Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re just going to put it inside your body just for the drug delivery. But once it\u2019s in your body, don\u2019t worry. We won\u2019t use it for anything else.\u201d Do you believe that? They are liars. They lied from the beginning. We know by Dr. David Martin that\u2026 We know where the coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, came from, right? It\u2019s patented 2002. There\u2019s a patent. That means it was made in a lab. Someone\u2019s making money off of it. We know where it came from. It\u2019s not from some bat soup shop, whatever, in China. It\u2019s a lie. Dr. Carrie Madej: So all of them are the same. Some of them say they\u2019re doing different things. Sometimes they\u2019re using a vector. Vector means they\u2019re using a cold virus that is infecting you purposely and then it\u2019ll inject this genetic material inside of you. Some are just using the hydrogel, right? They\u2019re telling us they\u2019re doing different ways. And I knew this, but I wanted to see it with my own eyes. I don\u2019t trust them, right? And I\u2019ll show you some photos. So Moderna also says that it\u2019s trying to put an operating system inside of you. An operating system just like Windows. We know Windows is terrible. Viruses all the time, right? They messed up on that. How are they going to make this one good? Impossible. And were you given informed consent? Have they told us about this? No. They\u2019re liars. Again, this is the theme. They\u2019re lying. Satan is the greatest of deceivers, right? Dr. Carrie Madej: So with this hydrogel, different things come under hydrogel, nanobots, graphing, magnetic particles, et cetera. But that\u2019s the mother of all of that substance. And just to FYI, hydrogel is the opposite of water life. We\u2019re over 90% water. Water gives life. It freezes when it\u2019s not supposed to freeze. When it freezes, it expands instead of condenses, something very strange. It boils when it\u2019s not supposed to boil. It makes different crystal structures depending on intention, where it comes from. It\u2019s beautiful. It has intelligence in life. Water\u2019s life. Hydrogel is water gel. It sucks the life out. It literally will dry out the water. That is not healthy for any human body. And they want to put nanobots inside of you just like this. Dr. Carrie Madej: And how could they do that? Well, one little syringe needle, one little syringe needle, 1 million can fit in there. And this is one of the symbols of hydrogel. You want to see how it moves inside? This could be assembling, disassembling, reassembling in your body to do innumerable tasks, do innumerable things. I want to show you another nanobot. This is called a TRAP bot, okay? I actually have seen images of this in the vial, somebody whose vials we\u2019re injecting into people. Speaker 5: Organization-based microrobots or TRAP bots which can capture and transport live cells to a desired location. Much like a spider weaving a web, these microbots can spit out thread-like gel to trap living cells and incorporate them in their hollow microcylinder. This microcylinder is about 200 micrometers in diameter. It also contains the ingredients for these cell trapping gel, which creates a long thread-like structure while [inaudible 00:19:17] allows for magnetic- Dr. Carrie Madej: Okay. So this is just giving you an example of how it can move through the body and what is directing the movement? A magnet or magnet force, a magnetic force. And it\u2019s very minuscule, but I don\u2019t know if you noticed what they\u2019re saying. There\u2019s a long string-like, hair-like substances gel, hydrogel, coming from it that builds, it can actually build and grow as it\u2019s squirming through the body. Hydrogel is also important to know because it can create its own electricity, okay? Think about to build a computer, you need some power. You need electricity. So we are powerful beings, A, and now the hydrogel can produce its own electricity. But remember computers when you have a laptop on your lap and it\u2019s been working for a while, it gets really hot. They have to cool down. So the problem is when something is generating a lot of computing power, how do we cool it down? Oh, don\u2019t worry. Hydrogel can cool itself down. They\u2019ve already thought about this. Dr. Carrie Madej: And just so you know, hydrogel in a injection with Moderna, Pfizer, et cetera, they\u2019re calling it nanolipid particle. So nanolipid particle is a creative way of saying the same word as hydrogel just so you know. Again, DARPA has their clarity project with hydrogel, and what they\u2019re saying is that they\u2019re so good at it when they inject it into the human body in some of their military experiments, they were able to mold it and make it a hybrid tissue with the brain and the nervous system of the military victim. And so when they did that, they could see through and feel and know what that soldier is thinking like an avatar. Use them as computer simulation game. And they think this is great. So this guy you need to know, he\u2019ll explain about the technology. Speaker 6: [crosstalk 00:21:23] the sensory cortex of the second animal and that animal acquires the knowledge. From the human drone technology standpoint, you can attach the human brain to another human brain, you can direct motor activity, or you can send communication and information. Dr. Venter\u2019s work is in my view, the equivalent of the development of nuclear weapons when you realize that he created life in a cell. He programmed yeast cells to produce anything he wanted. These can be inserted into you through the hypospray needles. You put in a specific gene slicing, you program what you like, you put it in the cell and it can reproduce and make as much as you like. It sends a signal and it tells which portion of the DNA should unwrap, unfold, and produce a product. Speaker 6: Related to this is an idea called DREADDs. These are designer receptors that can be remotely controlled. You can create a cell, you can put it somewhere in the body and you can remotely activate it. So you have the capacity to create any product as long as you know the DNA sequence, you can insert it into a living system and you can remotely control it. That may affect the way you think, the way you act. So once you know that the technology is there to edit, splice, and program the cell and the technology currently exists to administer to somebody and have it go park anywhere you program it to go park proliferate and do its function, you can have things activated in other people\u2019s brains. Speaker 6: These people have figured out how to hide imagery in the DNA of bacteria. You can have the information reproduced in a string form as a form of a protein. The new way to hide information is going to be in DNA. This is the first experiment showing what imagery you can hide in bacteria. This is the latest. It\u2019s a GIF file. Well, this is what the Chinese are doing with DNA. Merging DNA systems with quantum computing will be really quite an amazing and both lethal threat. The next thing I wanted to mention to you is memory. Can we erase memory? Can we modify memory? Can we change memory? Of course the short answer is yes. Dr. Carrie Madej: So I want you to know the brief thing of this this guy works with is bioweapons with this kind of nanotechnology. And he\u2019s saying what they can is do this kind of substance like the hydrogel, okay? And they can use it for multiple purposes. They\u2019re so good at it with these nanobots. They can rewrite your memory. They can erase your memory, put a new memory inside of you. If you have this substance inside of you that they could do all these things, do you trust them when they say it\u2019s just a drug delivery system. Don\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t trust them. I don\u2019t trust them at all. They can make new memories. They can send an impulse into the body and make you feel something, make a toxin produced, make a neuropeptide produced. There\u2019s no good thing. There\u2019s no God-given reason why anybody would do that to another human. Dr. Carrie Madej: And just so you know, you might\u2019ve seen this, patent 2020\/060606. Do you think they picked 666 by accident? People have marketing departments, I know, and they know that we have a visceral reaction to 666. We have a contact tracing act, 6666, right? Moderna has ingredients with a number 0.666 or 6.666. This is not accident guys. Symbolism is everywhere. Pay attention. They use symbolism and they will tell you who they serve. And here they\u2019re showing the person as a little tiny speck, that\u2019s you or me, and then there\u2019s a device, which is your cell phone or my cell phone, and then you are wirelessly connected to your cell phone. How does that happen? They have to have a substance inside of you to make you wirelessly connected to everything. It\u2019s called the internet of bodies, the internet of things. And so how do they do that? You have to ask yourself. They want to do it by 2030. They have to make you a walking Wi-Fi electronic device. They can do it with the hydrogel or the nanolipid particle. Dr. Carrie Madej: And just so you know, Gates loves this kind of thing because they can hijack your brain when you\u2019re sleeping or just reading the magazine because they can do computing power in the background like a computer and they\u2019re going to make money off of you and you didn\u2019t know it, right? If you accept this technology inside of you. They also want to use it with social credit system of China. I\u2019m kind of speeding through some of these things just because I want to get to the pictures of what I saw inside the microscope. Dr. Carrie Madej: But let\u2019s say you don\u2019t believe what I say. That\u2019s fine. Just know that Bill Gates does. His company in West Africa, along with MasterCard, along with Trust Stamp and artificial intelligence program have combined forces. Since July, 2020, they\u2019ve been experimenting on the people there. Giving them the same shots we have here. Same technology. They are giving them a barcode or a numeric number. Each one is unique. Everything\u2019s downloaded, their medical records, their vaccination records, and their ability to do commodity is also downloaded, downloaded into their body. Doesn\u2019t that sound like something from the book of Revelation? And if they don\u2019t accept it, they\u2019re locked out. It\u2019s a war on cash. Dr. Carrie Madej: So since they have this technology inside the people, what Bill Gates said, he\u2019s like, \u201cWell, since we already have the hydrogel nanolipid particle inside of you, we\u2019re also going to start using it for surveillance and predictive policing.\u201d Just like I warned you about. They\u2019re doing it to the people right now like the Tom cruise Minority Report. They say once it\u2019s perfected there, all developed countries will get it. That\u2019s you and me too guys. What do they call it? Wellness pass or a vaccine passport. This is why we fight, this is why we say no, this is why we do not comply. Dr. Carrie Madej: And so I talked a lot about this, right? And how did I even get to know about this? Well, if some of you heard my story, you\u2019ll know that at some point of my career, I was recruited. They thought I would be a good person on their side. I was recruited to business owners meetings in Metro Atlanta, as well as scientific meetings where I got to meet Dr. Craig Venter, okay? And so in these meetings, they talked about this whole transhumanist movement and how it was great. We would be the controllers in the room. Don\u2019t worry. We would be exempt. Everybody else would be controlled. I was horrified. I was horrified to see everybody standing ovation and clapping for this. Like who are they? And I asked, \u201cHow could you be for this?\u201d They said, \u201cOh, well, it does sound a little bad, but you know what? Carrie, soon it\u2019s going to be us or them. And so we have to. You\u2019re going to want to be on our side. You don\u2019t want to be on the other side. It\u2019s going to be bad.\u201d Dr. Carrie Madej: I said, \u201cI would never do that. And you\u2019re a fool. You\u2019re a fool to think that this technology wouldn\u2019t be turned back on you because we are human beings, right?\u201d And they have a super computer that wants to guide all of this. A computer doesn\u2019t care who you are. It has an algorithm. You have a dollar sign in your head. Sound like the Marines, all for one, one for all. Computers sees it as foolish, frivolous, right? So I had all this knowledge. That\u2019s how I got to know how to research for it, but I was still not happy. I\u2019m a person. I have to know, right? So I decided I\u2019m going to look at inside of these vials, even though it\u2019s not legal, I don\u2019t care because if something goes against my God-given rights and my human rights, it is my duty to break that law. Dr. Carrie Madej: This is our world, our planet, our children, our bodies. Don\u2019t give it away. It\u2019s ours, right? So this is one of the pictures of Moderna. I put two drops on a glass slide. I had a compound microscope. That\u2019s it guys. You could get it easily. 300 bucks. And I had a white light going up on the middle and a glass top on the very top. And that\u2019s it. I waited two hours and it was translucent at first then all of a sudden colors appeared. Vibrant purples, blues, reds, greens. I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this chemical reaction.\u201d There was no chemical reaction, right? So I ended up finding out all these colors, actually, when they appear under a white light, that\u2019s a sign of a super conducting material inside these injections. All the manufacturers have that. What that means, it\u2019s proof they\u2019re putting an injectable computing system inside every single one of these vials. An injectable computing system. Did they say anything to any of us? No. Dr. Carrie Madej: There\u2019s little cubes on this one. Were just showing some of these photos. Here\u2019s another one. It\u2019s hard to see on this photo, but at the very edge, there\u2019s a cube-like structure. We\u2019re not quite sure exactly what that is right now. So also I saw a lot of metallic flex fragments. I didn\u2019t see anything about metal fragments on the ingredient list again. And these metallic fragments to me look a little more exotic. It\u2019s not like your typical aluminum, et cetera, right? This one is strange. It\u2019s so opaque. It leaves its own shadow. Some of these pictures are between 100 times magnification, which is nothing, to 400 up to 600 times magnification. This is not nanotechnology. This is not looking at nanotechnology. This is at a much grander scale. This is crazy. Dr. Carrie Madej: So this picture kind of has been going around I think. I\u2019m going to give you a close-up of him. This was on the first slide I did and there\u2019s the cover slip, right? So everything gravitated to the very edges of the cover slip. That\u2019s where I saw a lot of action. There was a lot of aggregation. There is self-assembling. This is two hours. It\u2019s not like 12 hours. Two hours time. I also saw this thing. I was shocked. It actually was able to lift itself up off of the glass slide. You can\u2019t see it? Okay. It was able to lift itself up off of the glass slide. It had tentacles like you see here. It was able to move. It is my opinion and it is my interpretation that it was self-aware. I\u2019ve never encountered anything like that. I\u2019ve done slides, I\u2019ve done all kinds of preparation of slides of biologic materials, et cetera. Never have I witnessed anything like that. Dr. Carrie Madej: And so I did cry. I cried. And then I thought, well, okay, perhaps that was a fluke. Surely maybe some contamination, right? So two months later, I get another Moderna vial and I look at it under the microscope and here\u2019s\u2026 What is that? Still trying to figure it out guys, but we shouldn\u2019t have unidentified objects inside of these injections. Another of these string-like material, I\u2019m like looking I\u2019m like, \u201cThis almost looks like some kind of a living organism.\u201d And then I see another one. And then I cried hard. You may not know what that means. I do. These are parasites better made to meld with your nervous tissue. Imagine a child that is forming their neural network. I want you to feel what I feel. I want you to get that righteous anger. We need it now. No more. Dr. Carrie Madej: Just on a side, if you know the book of Revelation, does it kind of look like a scorpion? Guess what else it can do. The tentacles, it\u2019s called Hydra vulgaris. The tentacles have the ability to give a paralyzing, a venomous or a toxic reaction. Wow, it sounds like something else that I read, right? Why would they want that? Well, Hydra vulgaris is actually a organism, and I don\u2019t know what that is, it\u2019s an organism that is immortal in the lab. It can continually renew itself. If you chop it up into tiny pieces, put in a petri dish, it will actually self-assemble itself back over and over and over again innumerable times. It\u2019ll make itself anew. If you chop off a tentacle, three more will grow. And the transhumanists love this organism. They think it\u2019s fantastic. Again, that was 100 magnification, I\u2019m sorry, the last one. So this is the edge of the cover slip. There\u2019s a lot of debris kind of grapheme-like material. And then we start to see a lot of ring structures in here. Dr. Carrie Madej: Now, this one is with the Johnson & Johnson vial. Let me get to the\u2026 So, again, ring-like structures. What they are is they appear to be delivery systems. So they\u2019ll start like this and they get bigger, bigger, bigger. They fend themselves out. A gelatinous material extrudes from it like a hydrogel, okay? And then this was like a bundle of cells growing. What are those cells? We don\u2019t know. We need to analyze them. What kind of cells are being injected into people? A crystalline structure, little crystals. Like literally, this is like a kitchen sink, dirty kind of a experiment going on. These are iridescence silicone-like wafers. If they pile on top of each other, they can make their own circuitry boards. Hydrogel it\u2019s a gelatinous material here. Again, more hydrogel with more of these spheres, these rings. So I saw them at all the manufacturers, all of them. So no one is different than another. I don\u2019t care if they come up with a new one, guys. Don\u2019t ask me if it\u2019s safe to take it. They\u2019re all bad. Dr. Carrie Madej: So I was very fortunate to work with Project Veritas recently. So bravo, right? They\u2019re amazing patriots. Another round of applause. So they will be releasing their findings soon. I worked with them. And so we were looking under the microscope at Pfizer vial and they have documentation to share too from a brave whistleblower. So anyway, this is a Pfizer vial. You see a lot of these dark particles. These are like graphene oxide particle material. So what we were witnessing over time under the microscope was something called Teslaphoresis. Have you heard of that? So what that means is that you can put all these little tiny beads, let\u2019s say, that have the potential to make their own wiring in the body. And what you do is you could just have an external magnetic force or another kind of electric force, let\u2019s say, or frequency, and they will start to form and coalesce into a string-like spider web all by themselves. Dr. Carrie Madej: So you just have to put the junk in somewhere, turn on a frequency and voila, it starts to make its own neural network, a string-like consistency. We were seeing it here inside of this vial starting to coalesce, starting to form structures. It\u2019s a little bit difficult to see, but up there, if I can do a pointer. Can\u2019t see my pointer. Anyhow, there\u2019s a [inaudible 00:37:55] kind of figure in the middle. So if you knew what a human nerve cell looked like, a dendrite, it would look just like this, but this isn\u2019t from a human guys. This is from whatever they\u2019re injecting inside of you. Literally, this is my opinion, they\u2019re trying to put another kind of nervous system inside of you, but an AI kind, or they\u2019re hijacking this parasite to put inside of you. These are my hypotheses. I encourage you to do your own research. And for the people who don\u2019t believe me, under the microscope, you can get a $300 microscope and you can put the drops on there and you can look and see the pictures too, right? Dr. Carrie Madej: So this is another organism. We see this over and over. This would be like a Polypodium or a Hydra vulgaris organism. Again, we see this over, over, over. It\u2019s not a mistake. It\u2019s in different states, multiple vials, multiple batches, multiple times. There\u2019s no mistake. Another one. This is very similar to some ectoderm of a parasite. We could go on and on, parasite after parasite looking\u2026 And let me back up. They appear to be parasites, right? If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, it probably is, right? Again, more ring-like structures. Dr. Carrie Madej: How is this in the betterment of humanity? Is this why ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine are so banned from everybody? Right? Now we know. I want you to see this guy. This guy is another organism that we saw. This was in a Johnson & Johnson vial. Watch closely the translucent thing that moves around the edge of the ring. Do you see that? At first I thought it was another\u2026 Let me back up and do that again so you can see. Okay. Oops, I\u2019m going to try to do this properly. Okay. All right. Play. Ah, sorry guys. Anyway, it\u2019s a translucent\u2026 I thought it was like a larvae, like another life form, but the way it moved was more robotic to me. This could be a nanobot. We don\u2019t know. I\u2019m showing you pictures. And I think you don\u2019t have to have a science degree. You don\u2019t have to have a medical degree to know that should not be in any human body injected into to our children, our babies, and us. Dr. Carrie Madej: I want to show you this. We had a healthy blood of a young man, put a drop under the slide. It moved normally, right? Every time we added a drop of the injection from the Pfizer vial, this organism formed, which looked just like the coronavirus. You know what? It wasn\u2019t in the vial by itself. It wasn\u2019t in the blood. Only when the blood and the injection, or I\u2019m sorry, the contents of the vial hit together, that formed. I want to hypothesize that this structure they\u2019re calling the coronavirus is inside these vials. It\u2019s a hypothesis that\u2019s saying, we need to look into it. Dr. Carrie Madej: I want you to see how much\u2026 This is one drop of Moderna. One drop. One drop. Look at the movement. It\u2019s not normal. They tell you they\u2019re putting living organisms inside of you. This is just more graphing kind of a substance. Hydra vulgaris, look it up. UC Davis loves this against the transhumanist movement because of all of this. And it\u2019s kind of funny they like to say hail Hydra. Have you heard of that before? Symbolism is everywhere. Watch for it then you\u2019ll know who they serve. Just more about the hail Hydra and its life forms, but I like to always see symbolism, right? So the grown version of this Hydra is called a medusa and the Hydra also means many headed serpent. Wow, I read that before on the book of Revelation. This is just showing how they can chop it up and put it into a vial and then it can grow itself again once it\u2019s in its host. Dr. Carrie Madej: I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t hear you. I\u2019ll go back. Sorry about that. Okay, got it. Is that good? Okay, got it. Okay, this slide was just to show you that maybe one may not be Hydro vulgaris. Maybe it\u2019s Nematostella or Acropora. Okay, my point is it comes from the same family. They all can do the same things, okay? We can go into splicing hairs later, but this is just to show you that they all can do this. And so my warning to you is this is a picture. It says a thousand words, right? And I want to shock you. I want to make you have emotion and passion because that\u2019s what we need right now. Dr. Carrie Madej: And people ask me, \u201cWell, how did this happen and how do we get out of it?\u201d Why we got here it\u2019s one reason. We disconnected ourselves from God, our Father in heaven. God did not leave us. We love God. We need to make that right. These are praying and worshiping and putting God first in everything and remembering who you are and what you are. You are royal birthright. You have a divinity inside of you, a light that God gave every single one of us if you choose to connect with it because we have free will, right? Dr. Carrie Madej: If you haven\u2019t read on Jesus Christ, you should because he gave us the instructions on what to do right now. With God we are unstoppable. We are powerful beings. We don\u2019t have to be afraid of any of this technology because with God, we have this force that in a blink of an eye, we change it all. And you just don\u2019t know who you are yet. And I\u2019m here with you because I\u2019m here to remind you who you are. And for my last breath on this earth, I will fight with you and for you and for the world and for our children. There\u2019s nothing greater in this world. Thank you. [inaudible 00:45:01]. Ty Bollinger: Dr. Carrie Madej. Wow, that was amazing. That was amazing. I was watching that for quite a while from the back and blown away with a lot of that stuff. A lot of the stuff I was not even aware of though. Thank you Dr. Madej.

        "text":"Since late last year, messenger RNA for Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccines, including its recently reformulated Omicron booster, has been exclusively manufactured by a little known company with significant ties to US intelligence. by WHITNEY WEBB Unlimited Hangout Earlier this week, the United Kingdom became the first country to approve Moderna\u2019s reformulated version of its COVID-19 vaccine, which claims to provide protection against both the original form of the virus and the significantly less lethal but more transmissible Omicron variant. The product was approved by the UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) with the support of the UK government\u2019s Commission on Human Medicines. Described by UK officials as a \u201csharpened tool\u201d in the nation\u2019s continued vaccination campaign, the reformulated vaccine combines the previously approved COVID-19 vaccine with a \u201cvaccine candidate\u201d targeting the Omicron variant BA.1. That vaccine candidate has never been previously approved and has not been the subject of independent study. The MHRA approved the vaccine based on a single, incomplete human trial currently being conducted by Moderna. The company promoted incomplete data from that trial in company press releases in June and July. The study has yet to be published in a medical journal or peer reviewed. No concerns have been raised by any regulatory agency, including the MHRA, regarding Moderna\u2019s past history of engaging in suspect and likely illegal activity in past product trials, including for its original COVID-19 vaccine. The approval comes shortly before several Western countries, including the UK, plan to conduct a massive COVID-19 booster vaccination campaign this fall. Moderna has also noted that approval for its Omicron booster vaccine are pending in the US, EU, Australia and Canada \u2013 all of which are also planning fall vaccination campaigns focused on COVID-19. The company\u2019s CEO, St\u00e9phane Bancel, has called the reformulated vaccine \u201cour lead candidate for a Fall 2022 booster.\u201d Moderna CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel, Source: ClockworkOrange However, unlike the company\u2019s original COVID-19 vaccine, the genetic material, or messenger RNA (mRNA), for this new vaccine, including the newly formulated genetic material meant to provide protection against the Omicron variant, is being manufactured, not by Moderna, but by a relatively new company that has received hardly any media attention, despite its overt links to US intelligence. Last September, it was quietly announced that a company called National Resilience (often referred to simply as Resilience) would begin manufacturing the mRNA for Moderna COVID-19 vaccine products. Under the terms of the multi-year agreement, \u201cResilience will produce mRNA for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at its facility in Mississauga, Ontario, for distribution worldwide.\u201d \u201cReinventing Biomanufacturing\u201d National Resilience was founded relatively recently, in November 2020, and describes itself as \u201ca manufacturing and technology company dedicated to broadening access to complex medicines and protecting biopharmaceutical supply chains against disruption.\u201d It has since been building \u201ca sustainable network of high-tech, end-to-end manufacturing solutions with the aim to ensure the medicines of today and tomorrow can be made quickly, safely, and at scale.\u201d It furtherplans to \u201creinvent biomanufacturing\u201d and \u201cdemocratize access to medicines,\u201d namely gene therapies, experimental vaccines and other \u201cmedicines of tomorrow.\u201d In pursuit of those goals, the company announced it would \u201cactively invest in developing powerful new technologies to manufacture complex medicines that are defining the future of therapeutics, including cell and gene therapies, viral vectors, vaccines, and proteins.\u201d It was founded with the reported intention \u201cto build a better system for manufacturing complex medicines to fight deadly diseases\u201d as a way to improve post-COVID \u201cpandemic preparedness.\u201d The company initially marketed its manufacturing capabilities as \u201cthe Resilience platform\u201d, and offers principally \u201cRNA Modalities\u201d, including RNA development for vaccines, gene editing and therapeutics; and \u201cVirus Production\u201d, including viral vectors, oncolytic viruses (i.e. a virus engineered to preferentially attack cancer cells), viruses for use in vaccine development and gene-edited viruses for unspecified purposes. It is worth noting that, to date, many controversial \u201cgain-of-function\u201d experiments have justified modifying viruses for the same purposes as described by National Resilience\u2019s Virus Production capabilities. In addition, National Resilience offers product formulations and other modalities, such as biologics and cell therapies, to its clientele and the \u201cVirus Production\u201d of its website has since been removed. Resilience CEO Rahul Singhvi, Source: Resilience National Resilience, being such a young company, has very few clients and there is little publicly available information on its manufacturing capabilities aside from the company\u2019s website. The firm only acquired its first commercial manufacturing plant in March 2021, located in Boston, MA and purchased from Sanofi, followed shortly thereafter by the acquisition of another separate plant located in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Makeovers were announced for the plants, but little is publicly known about their progress. Prior to the acquisitions, the company had been subleasing a Bay area facility in Fremont, California. Reporters were puzzled at the time as to why a company with roughly 700 employees at the time had acquired a total of 599,00 square feet of manufacturing space after having only emerged from stealth less than 6 months prior. In April 2021, National Resilience acquired Ology Bioservices Inc., which had received a $37 million contract from the US military the previous November to develop an advanced anti-COVID-19 monoclonal antibody treatment. This acquisition also provided National Resilience with its first Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory and the ability to manufacture cell and gene therapies, live viral vaccines and vectors and oncolytic viruses. Despite being in the earliest stages of developing its \u201crevolutionary\u201d manufacturing capabilities, National Resilience entered into a partnership with the Government of Canada in July of last year. Per that agreement, the Canadian government plans to invest CAD 199.2 million (about $154.9 million) into National Resilience\u2019s Ontario-based subsidiary, Resilience Biotechnologies Inc. Most of those funds are destined for use in expanding the Ontario facility that Resilience acquired last March and which is now manufacturing the mRNA for Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 products. Canada\u2019s Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne, asserted at the time that the investment would \u201cbuild future pandemic preparedness\u201d and help \u201cto grow Canada\u2019s life science ecosystem as an engine for our economic recovery.\u201d More recently, in 2022, the company has announced a few new clients \u2013 Takeda, Opus Genetics and the US Department of Defense. According to National Resilience\u2019s executives, the company\u2019s ambitions apparently go far beyond manufacturing RNA and viruses. For instance, Resilience CEO Rahul Singhvi has claimed that the company is seeking to build \u201cthe world\u2019s most advanced biopharmaceutical manufacturing ecosystem.\u201d Yet, Singhvi has declined to offer much in the way of specifics when it comes to exactly how the company plans to become the planet\u2019s most elite biomanufacturing company. In an interview with The San Francisco Business Times, Singhvi states that Resilience is looking to fill its massive manufacturing plants with \u201ctechnologies and people that can set and apply new standards for manufacturing cell therapies and gene therapies as well as RNA-based treatments.\u201d Prior to Resilience, Singhvi was CEO of NovaVax and an operating partner at Flagship Pioneering, which played a major role in the creation and rise of Moderna. Singhvi has further insisted that National Resilience is \u201cnot a therapeutics company, not a contractor and not a tools company\u201d and instead aims \u201cto boost production using the new therapeutic modalities\u201d such as RNA-based treatments, which have become normalized in the COVID-19 era. Whereas contract manufacturers \u201care like kitchens, with pots and pans ready for any recipe,\u201d \u201cwhat we\u2019re trying to do is fix the recipes,\u201d Singhvi has explained. One member of Resilience\u2019s board of directors, former FDA Commissioner and Pfizer Board member Scott Gottlieb, has described the company as seeking to act as the equivalent of Amazon Web Services for the biotechnology industry. Essentially, Resilience bills itself as offering solutions that will allow \u201cfuturistic\u201d medicines, including mRNA vaccines, to be produced more quickly and more efficiently, with the apparent goal of monopolizing certain parts of the biomanufacturing process. It also appears poised to become the manufacturer of choice for mRNA vaccines and experimental therapeutics in the event of a future pandemic, which some public health \u201cphilanthropists\u201d like Bill Gates have said is imminent. Perhaps the company\u2019s most noteworthy ambition relates to their claims that they support clients through the government regulatory process. Given the company\u2019s emphasis on speedy mass production of experimental gene therapies, its stated intention of getting the \u201cfuturistic\u201d medical products it manufactures to market as quickly as possible seems at odds with the slower, traditional regulatory processes. Indeed, one could easily argue that the approvals of mRNA vaccines for the first time in human history during the COVID-19 crisis were only possible because of the major relaxing of regulatory procedurse and safety testing due to the perceived urgency of the situation. Resilience seems intent on seeing that phenomenon repeat itself. As previously mentioned, the company claims to allow for the setting and application of \u201cnew standards for manufacturing cell therapies and gene therapies\u201d and also says it plans to become a \u201ctechnology-aggregating standards bearer that helps therapies come to market more efficiently.\u201d It previously offered on its website \u201cregulatory support\u201d and \u201cstrategy consulting\u201d to clients, suggesting that it would seek to mediate between clients and government regulators in order to fulfill its goal of having the products it manufactures taken to market more quickly. In addition, upon launch, the company claimed it planned to obtain unspecified \u201cregulatory capabilities.\u201d If so, it is certainly notable that former top Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials are either on the company\u2019s board or, as will be noted shortly, played a major role in the company\u2019s creation. The People Behind Resilience Resilience was co-founded by Biotech venture capitalist Robert Nelsen, who is known for listening \u201cto science\u2019s earliest whispers, even when data are too early for just about anyone else.\u201d Nelsen was one of the earliest investors in Illumina, a California-based gene-sequencing hardware and software giant that is believed to currently dominate the field of genomics. As mentioned in a previous Unlimited Hangout investigation, Illumina is closely tied to the DARPA-equivalent of the Wellcome Trust known as Wellcome Leap, which is also focused on \u201cfuturistic\u201d and transhumanist \u201cmedicines.\u201d Nelsen is now chairman of National Resilience\u2019s board, which is a \u201cWho\u2019s Who\u201d of big players from the US National Security State, Big Pharma and Pharma-related \u201cphilanthropy.\u201d Bob Nelsen of ARCH Venture Partners, Source: ARCH Venture Partners However, while Nelsen has been given much of the credit for creating Resilience, he revealed in one interview that the idea for the company had actually come from someone else \u2013 Luciana Borio. In July of last year, Nelsen revealed that it was while talking to Borio about \u201cher work running pandemic preparedness on the NSC [National Security Council]\u201d that had \u201chelped lead to the launch of Nelsen\u2019s $800 million biologics manufacturing startup Resilience.\u201d At the time of their conversation, Borio was the vice president of In-Q-tel, the venture capital arm of the CIA that has been used since its creation in the early 2000s to found a number of companies, many of which act as Agency fronts. Prior to In-Q-Tel, she served as director for medical and biodefense preparedness at the National Security Council during the Trump administration and had previously been the acting chief scientist at the FDA from 2015 to 2017. Borio is currently a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, a consultant to Goldman Sachs, a member of the Bill Gates-funded vaccine alliance CEPI, and a partner at Nelsen\u2019s venture capital firm ARCH Venture Partners, which funds Resilience. Nelsen\u2019s ARCH previously funded Nanosys, the company of the controversial scientist Charles Lieber. Around the time of her conversation with Nelsen that led to Resilience\u2019s creation, Borio was co-writing a policy paper for the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security that recommended linking COVID-19 vaccination status with food stamp programs and rent assistance as a possible means of coercing certain populations to take the experimental vaccine. Borio is hardly Resilience\u2019s only In-Q-Tel connection, as the CEO of In-Q-Tel, Chris Darby, sits on the company\u2019s board of directors. Darby is also on the board of directors of the CIA Officers Memorial Foundation. Darby was also recently a member of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI), where members of the military, intelligence community and Silicon Valley\u2019s top firms argued for the need to reduce the use of \u201clegacy systems\u201d in favor of AI-focused alternatives as a national security imperative. Among those \u201clegacy systems\u201d identified by the NSCAI were in-person doctor visits and even receiving medical care from a human doctor, as opposed to an AI \u201cdoctor.\u201d The NSCAI also argued for the removal of \u201cregulatory barriers\u201d that prevent these new technologies from replacing \u201clegacy systems.\u201d Resilience Board Member Drew Oetting, Source: 8VC Another notable board member, in discussing Resilience\u2019s intelligence ties, is Drew Oetting. Oetting works for Cerberus Capital Management, the firm headed by Steve Feinberg who previously led the President\u2019s Intelligence Advisory Board under the Trump administration. Cerberus is notably the parent company of DynCorp, a controversial US national security contractor tied to numerous scandals, including scandals related to sex trafficking in conflict zones. Oetting is also part of the CIA-linked Thorn NGO ostensibly focused on tackling child trafficking that was the subject of a previous Unlimited Hangout investigation. Oetting is also the co-founder of 8VC, a venture capital firm that is one of the main investors in Resilience. 8VC\u2019s other co-founder is Joe Lonsdale and Oetting \u201cstarted his career\u201d as Lonsdale\u2019s chief of staff. Lonsdale is the co-founder, alongside Peter Thiel and Alex Karp, of Palantir, a CIA front company and intelligence contractor that is the successor to DARPA\u2019s controversial Total Information Awareness (TIA) mass surveillance and data-mining program. In addition, Oetting previously worked for Bill Gates\u2019 investment fund. Also worth noting is the presence of Joseph Robert Kerrey, former US Senator for Nebraska and a former member of the conflict-of-interest-ridden 9\/11 Commission, on Resilience\u2019s board. Kerrey is currently managing director of Allen & Co., a New York investment banking firm which has hosted an annual \u201csummer camp for billionaires\u201d since 1983. Allen & Co. has long been a major player in networks where organized crime and intelligence intersect, and is mentioned repeatedly throughout my upcoming book One Nation Under Blackmail. For instance, Charles and Herbert Allen, who ran the firm for decades, had considerable business dealings with organized crime kingpins and frontmen for notorious gangsters like Meyer Lansky, particularly in the Bahamas. They were also business partners of Leslie Wexner\u2019s mentors A. Alfred Taubman and Max Fisher as well as associates of Earl Brian, one of the architects of the PROMIS software scandal \u2013 which saw organized crime and intelligence networks cooperate to steal and then compromise the PROMIS software for blackmail and clandestine intelligence-gathering purposes. Allen & Co. was a major investor in Brian\u2019s business interests in the technology industry that Brian used in attempts to bankrupt the developers of PROMIS, Inslaw Inc. and to market versions of PROMIS that had been compromised first by Israeli intelligence and, later, the CIA. In addition to these intelligence-linked individuals, the rest of Resilience\u2019s board includes the former CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Susan Desmond-Hellmann; former FDA Commissioner and Pfizer board member, Scott Gottlieb; two former executives at Johnson & Johnson; former president and CEO of Teva Pharmaceuticals North American branch, George Barrett; CalTech professor and board member of Alphabet (i.e. Google) and Illumina, Frances Arnold; former executive at Genentech and Merck, Patrick Yang; and Resilience CEO Rahul Singhvi. To Boost or Not to Boost It is certainly telling that the normally publicity hungry Moderna has said so little about its partnership with Resilience and that Resilience, despite its ambitious plans, has also avoided the media limelight. Considering Moderna\u2019s history and Resilience\u2019s connections, there may be more to this partnership that meets the eye and concerned members of the public would do well to keep a very close eye on Resilience, its partnerships, and the products it is manufacturing. Given that we now live in a world where government regulatory decisions on the approval of medicines are increasingly influenced by corporate press releases and normal regulatory procedures have fallen by the wayside for being too \u201cslow,\u201d there is likely to be little scrutiny of the genetic material that Resilience produces for the \u201cmedicines of tomorrow.\u201d This seems to be already true for Moderna\u2019s recently retooled COVID-19 vaccine, as there has been no independent examination of the new genetic sequence of mRNA used in the Omicron-specific vaccine candidate or its effects on the human body in the short, medium or long term. For those who are skeptical of the outsized role that intelligence-linked companies are playing in the attempted technological \u201crevolution\u201d in the medical field, it is best to consider Resilience\u2019s role in the upcoming fall vaccination campaign and in future pandemic and public health scenarios before trying its \u201cfuturistic\u201d products.

        "text":"by Matt Agorist The Free Thought Project As TFTP has reported, Sen. Richard Pan, D-Sacramento, who has sponsored a slew of mandatory vaccine laws throughout his career came out in 2019 to threaten the speech of those who question forced vaccination. Throughout the pandemic, Pan has been staunchly opposed to free speech and advocated for silencing anyone and everyone who doesn\u2019t worship at the alter of Big Pharma and TheScience(TM). Now, with the passage of Assembly Bill 2098, this tyrannical state senator has finally gotten his way and even doctors who question the safety of a product from a company with a known history of criminal behavior \u2014 will be punished by the state for doing so. TFTP predicted this was coming after a letter Pan wrote to the Attorney General of the United States, claiming that the \u201cdeliberate spread of vaccine information discouraging vaccination\u201d requires the surgeon general to \u201cstop this attack on our nation\u2019s health by addressing the spread of vaccine misinformation.\u201d He literally advocated for people to be jailed for questioning vaccines \u2014 and now he\u2019s gone even further. The prediction wasn\u2019t hard to make given that this totalitarian likened \u201cantivaxxers\u201d to terrorists and was given a platform in WaPo to do it. \u201cThis campaign to deny potentially life-saving vaccines to those seeking them, and to poison public opinion against vaccinations, could result in countless American deaths. That is akin to domestic terrorism,\u201d Pan wrote. Pan has also criticized Facebook and other social media groups for allowing vaccine skeptics to post their views when he was given a platform in the NY Times. \u201cThis movement not only puts out mis- or disinformation about vaccines or lies about vaccines, which in itself can be harmful, but they are also aggressively bullying, threatening and intimidating people who are trying to share accurate information about vaccines,\u201d Pan told the New York Times. But is questioning the safety of the COVID-19 jab really misinformation? According to the bill\u2019s text: THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS: SECTION 1.The Legislature finds and declares all of the following: (a) The global spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, or COVID-19, has claimed the lives of over 6,000,000 people worldwide, including nearly 90,000 Californians. (b) Data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that unvaccinated individuals are at a risk of dying from COVID-19 that is 11 times greater than those who are fully vaccinated. (c) The safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines have been confirmed through evaluation by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the vaccines continue to undergo intensive safety monitoring by the CDC. Aaron Kheriaty, a licensed medical doctor in the state of California points out, all three of these statements are demonstrably false:(a) The death count figures cited are grossly overestimated by hospitals failing to distinguish dying from covid vs. dying with covid and the financial incentives from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to overestimate covid deaths; (b) the efficacy of vaccines has declined with time and new variants, so the statistic cited here is no longer true of the vaccines against omicron; (c) the CDC has consistently failed to follow-up on serious safety signals, apart from myocarditis, and the post-marketing surveillance data acquired from our FOIA request showed serious safety issues in the first three months of vaccine rollout. Now, however, any physician who raises these or other inconvenient scientific facts or study findings could be disciplined by the medical board, as the text of the bill explains: \u201cIt shall constitute unprofessional conduct for a physician and surgeon to disseminate misinformation or disinformation related to COVID-19, including false or misleading information regarding the nature and risks of the virus, its prevention and treatment; and the development, safety, and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.\u201d If this is the case and they will apply this equally, will they go back and punish all the doctors who told the country for months that the vaccines are 100 percent effective? Will those who claimed that should you receive a COVID-19 vaccine you will not catch the virus and will not get sick, which is now a demonstrably false statement, be punished? According to former CDC director Dr. Deborah Birx, this was a statement which they knew was false from the beginning. In early 2021, CDC director Rochelle Walensky had no problem going on national television and declaring to the world that if you took the covid-19 vaccine \u201cyou will not get or spread covid.\u201d Within weeks, this was found to be entirely untrue. The CDC also changed positions on masks several times, claimed you can catch covid from touching surfaces, and continues to recommend cloth masks, despite the massive pile of data showing they do absolutely nothing. Dr. Anthony Fauci also spread the exact same misinformation, telling Americans that they had nothing to worry about once they took the shots. Yet hundreds of thousands of people who took the shots, got sick and died. Does this apply to all the state-funded doctors who told the country that if you get poked you can't spread or contract COVID-19? OR does it only apply to doctors who share peer-reviewed data showing the adverse effects of the poke? Asking for the Ministry of Truth. pic.twitter.com\/Xxpqc9CEz2 \u2014 Matt Agorist (@MattAgorist) August 30, 2022 Instead of holding these state actors and mass purveyors of misinformation accountable, this bill and others like it will target the folks responsible for proving these state actors wrong and getting us out of this mess. This is as shameful as it is dangerous. This bill will inevitably stifle medical progress by silencing anyone who challenges The Science(TM). But as we\u2019ve seen over the last two-and-a-half years, those who challenged the consensus on COVID-19 have helped usher in new treatments, policies, and programs that have saved lives. It was the establishment \u201cconsensus\u201d who refused to change and adapt, especially when it came to children \u2014 causing immeasurable suffering \u2014 the likes of which we are only just realizing. As Dr. Kheriaty noted in a letter to the California Assembly, urging them not to pass this bill in June, \u201cAllowing the free interchange among competing perspectives is absolutely necessary for scientific and medical progress. Good science is characterized by conjecture and refutation, lively deliberation, often fierce debate, and always openness to new data. The censorship of free speech in AB 2098 spells not only the demise of civil liberties and constitutional rights, but the end of the scientific enterprise when it comes to dealing with Covid in CA.\u201d Unfortunately, the thought police in California did not listen. RIP scientific method and freedom of speech. If history has taught us anything it\u2019s that the government declaring what is truth and what is not, is far more detrimental to a free society than any misleading or inaccurate information ever could be.

        "text":"Comments by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News A presentation recently made by Dr. Christof Plothe, a German Doctor of Osteopathy who is also a member of the World Council for Health, reveals the most startling evidence yet that COVID vaccines are causing massive cases of infertility, not just among women, but men also. Combined with the record volume of deaths and disabilities among the COVID-19 vaccinated, the future implications of what this vaccine has done to the human population and labor pool, is almost unfathomable. This information is NOT being reported in the corporate media, and to reference it is to be labeled as someone providing \u201cdisinformation\u201d by most. The presentation was made on the Iron Will Report. I will embed the video below. Show notes: Christof Plothe has done an in-depth study on the effects of the Covid \u2018vaccines\u2019 on pregnant women. His findings are truly disturbing. In just one example, the University of Chicago asked for women who had experienced post-injection menstrual irregularities to volunteer for a study. They hoped to find 500 women. To date, they have received over 140,000 applications! Mr. Plothe\u2019s data is shocking. He shares slides of his charts on a wide range of \u2018vaccine\u2019 affects, including drops in fertility around the world, accumulation of lipid nanoparticles and spike proteins in the various organs of the body, and the fact that the risk of miscarriage with the Covid \u2018vaccines\u2019 is over 1500 times higher than with the flu vaccine. How many safety studies were done on pregnant women? (Spoiler: the answer is \u2018none\u2019) How many of the \u2018scientists\u2019 involved in Pfizer\u2019s safety trial own shares in Pfizer? (Spoiler: the answer is \u2018all of them\u2019) To what degree have birth rates dropped around the world since the start of the \u2018vaccine\u2019 rollouts? Could the children of injected mothers be born sterile? Why were no human studies done on the effects of the lipid nanoparticles, which are known to be toxic? The lipid nanoparticles collect in the highest concentration in the reproductive organs. Is this intentional to produce infertility? What other side effects do the lipid nanoparticles produce? For how long do the spike proteins remain active (and damaging) in the human body? Highlights by Dr. Mark Trozzi: Pregnancy last 9 months, yet these \u201cvaccines\u201d were approved in in just 108 days. How can any claim of safety in pregnancy be made? Normally vaccine approval takes ten years. Pregnant women were excluded from clinical trials, yet the injections were declared safe for pregnant women. Based therefore on nothing! 270 women did get pregnant during the Pfizer trial ; of those 238 were not reported, and only one normal birth was reported. Polyethyleneglycol which is a component of the pegylated nanoparticle used to deliver the genetic material into the human cells was known to be a fetal toxin before since before covid was launched. Moderna and Pfizer-biotech studies on 44 rats for just 42 days demonstrated a doubling of preimplantation loss of pregnancy, and 295% increased rate of birth defects. There was no evaluation of next generation effects, and the researchers were riddled with conflicts of interest that they tried to hide. Fertility requires long term studies. These have not been done. By sept 2021 tens of thousands of menstrual problems in women were reported following the jabs, with heavy bleeding 8000 times normal! Japan study of biodistribution showed extensive distribution with profound concentration in women\u2019s ovaries. Potential mechanisms of fertility harm include pegylated nanoparticle toxicity, spike protein toxicity , immune response to SP , autoimmune attack on SP producing ovaries, and immune attack on an essential reproductive protein syncytin-1 which is structurally similar to SP. Moderna \u201cvaccine\u201d uses a higher dose of 100 mcg than Pfizer\u2019s 30 mcg dose. Pfizer stopped the higher dose due to even higher toxicity, but moderna still uses it. The injected mRNA persists in most victims for 2 months, and stimulates spike protein production with SP persisting 15 months. SP damages male testes with dramatic reduction in spermatogenisis An Israel study showed sperm count and male fertility decreased with just one shot, then the study was ended. So what happens with repeat doses? USA VAERS reveals massive infertility issue reports, accounting for 95% of all infertility reports in the 30 years of reporting for all vaccines combined. Around the world, wherever the \u201cvaccines\u201d are rolled out, birth rates drop dramatically nine months later. This is unprecedented, and includes Ireland, Germany, Australia, UK, Switzerland, Sweden, Canada, Hungary and others. The most injected countries have the biggest drops in birth rates. In comparison with influenza vaccines, these injections have a 1500% higher associated miscarriage rate. Some studies show polyethylene glycol causing next generation infertility. Perhaps injected people will have sterile children. We need long term controls, but drug companies injected the control subjects after the brief study periods, thus eliminating long term controls. The closest thing we have is the countries where people have best resisted the forced injections. Stop the Vaccines. Stop suppressing ivermectin and promote safe covid treatment. Stop the persecution of the doctors who have been scientifically and ethically correct from the beginning. These doctors must be exonerated and returned to serving the people who need us now more than ever. Dr Plothe explores the possibility of this genetic modification of humans to produce toxic viral spike proteins, being inherited and the implications that may have for the children. Presentation ends at 24 min and Will\u2019s questions start: Iron Will raises issues of malpractice, intention, misrepresentation, fraud, compromised journals, persecuted good doctors, and the CDC hiding deaths having removed 50,000 deaths from the VAERS data base and reclassifying them. Unknowns include: will this genetic experiment result in inheritable poison SP production in humans? Will there be future generations? Dr Plothe is seeing many covid \u201cvaccine\u201d damaged patients daily in his practice and he relates some of these experiences. Dr Plothe reminds us how science really works, and calls to end the suppression and have open forums. \u201cLets go back to science; today, not tomorrow.\u201d Comment by Dr Trozzi: Thanks to Iron Will and Dr Plothe. The reality is tragic; but this interview and content is exceptional. There should be no question about stopping these injections immediately, as well as investigating and prosecuting the many high profiting perpetrators and accomplices to unprecedented crimes against humanity. Imagine, even at this time, the Universities of Western Ontario and Toronto are demanding that students be injected and subjected to this sterilization, or forfeit their education. Government officials who are mandating this are at war with innocent unsuspecting men, women, and children. Comment on this article at HealthImpactNews.com. See Also: Over 11 MILLION Views!

Potential mechanisms of fertility harm include pegylated nanoparticle toxicity, spike protein toxicity , immune response to SP , autoimmune attack on SP producing ovaries, and immune attack on an essential reproductive protein syncytin-1 which is structurally similar to SP. Moderna \u201cvaccine\u201d uses a higher dose of 100 mcg than Pfizer\u2019s 30 mcg dose. Pfizer stopped the higher dose due to even higher toxicity, but moderna still uses it. The injected mRNA persists in most victims for 2 months, and stimulates spike protein production with SP persisting 15 months. SP damages male testes with dramatic reduction in spermatogenisis An Israel study showed sperm count and male fertility decreased with just one shot, then the study was ended. So what happens with repeat doses? USA VAERS reveals massive infertility issue reports, accounting for 95% of all infertility reports in the 30 years of reporting for all vaccines combined. Around the world, wherever the \u201cvaccines\u201d are rolled out, birth rates drop dramatically nine months later. This is unprecedented, and includes Ireland, Germany, Australia, UK, Switzerland, Sweden, Canada, Hungary and others. The most injected countries have the biggest drops in birth rates. In comparison with influenza vaccines, these injections have a 1500% higher associated miscarriage rate. Some studies show polyethylene glycol causing next generation infertility. Perhaps injected people will have sterile children. We need long term controls, but drug companies injected the control subjects after the brief study periods, thus eliminating long term controls. The closest thing we have is the countries where people have best resisted the forced injections. Stop the Vaccines. Stop suppressing ivermectin and promote safe covid treatment. Stop the persecution of the doctors who have been scientifically and ethically correct from the beginning. These doctors must be exonerated and returned to serving the people who need us now more than ever. Dr Plothe explores the possibility of this genetic modification of humans to produce toxic viral spike proteins, being inherited and the implications that may have for the children. Presentation ends at 24 min and Will\u2019s questions start: Iron Will raises issues of malpractice, intention, misrepresentation, fraud, compromised journals, persecuted good doctors, and the CDC hiding deaths having removed 50,000 deaths from the VAERS data base and reclassifying them. Unknowns include: will this genetic experiment result in inheritable poison SP production in humans? Will there be future generations? Dr Plothe is seeing many covid \u201cvaccine\u201d damaged patients daily in his practice and he relates some of these experiences. Dr Plothe reminds us how science really works, and calls to end the suppression and have open forums. \u201cLets go back to science; today, not tomorrow.\u201d Comment by Dr Trozzi: Thanks to Iron Will and Dr Plothe. The reality is tragic; but this interview and content is exceptional. There should be no question about stopping these injections immediately, as well as investigating and prosecuting the many high profiting perpetrators and accomplices to unprecedented crimes against humanity. Imagine, even at this time, the Universities of Western Ontario and Toronto are demanding that students be injected and subjected to this sterilization, or forfeit their education. Government officials who are mandating this are at war with innocent unsuspecting men, women, and children. Comment on this article at HealthImpactNews.com. See Also: Over 11 MILLION Views!

        "text":"Share this... It\u2019s really hard to believe it\u2019s happening \u2013 today \u2013 in Europe. Germany returns to darkness. Police randomly target, pick off peaceful demonstrators and strollers. Symbol photo. Source: Freie Niedersachsen As Germany scrambles to stifle the growing grassroots movement against COVID restrictions and vaccine mandates, authorities are resorting to ever more extreme tactics to snuff out the people\u2019s right to dissent. One retired German professor recounts his own experience. =========================== By Prof. Dr. Stefan Homburg Originally published at Reitschuster.de [Hanover] Yesterday, the Monday after New Year\u2019s Day, 2022, I wanted to watch for the first time one of the \u201cwalks\u201d now taking place by the thousands all over Germany as the authorities have banned demonstrations. I know from the newspaper that the police have issued a general order on FFP2 masks to make it easier to take tougher action against walkers. The medical bogus arguments are no longer used, so I put a mask in my pocket. At the Town Hall, the designated meeting place, I can only see a huge police contingent. I stroll alone to the state parliament, where a large group of people are being detained and requested to assign a leader of the meeting. I stay away from that and continue to Hanover\u2019s Kr\u00f6pcke central square, where on this mild January evening several hundred people can be found, most of them on their way to or from the shops. Keeping an eye out for possible walkers, I stop for a moment and a lady standing next to me abruptly says she hasn\u2019t been downtown for ages because of lockdowns and masks. As I feel the same way, we admire the Christmas decorations together for half a minute. As I want to move on, there are suddenly five police officers in front of us and, as I turn around, about ten to fifteen behind us, forming a ring around the lady, myself and maybe eight other, mostly older people. Asked what this means, a blonde policewoman answers me that she hereby declares us an [illegal] assembly. I immediately put on my FFP2 mask, am honestly shocked and reply that this is probably a civic prank. As a result of the police presence and the crowd that has formed, there are now many spectators in the square, and basically any group of people could be surrounded from behind and declared an \u201cassembly\u201d. An acquaintance who happens to be passing by wants to join me, but she is not allowed into police-surrounded group, and I am not allowed out. More and more police officers arrive, also spectators, and the whole scene is getting filmed many times over. I also receive shouts from people who recognize me and express their surprise at this strange measure. The term \u201cfascism\u201d gets used, and the police officers are verbally attacked harshly by the bystanders. After about a quarter of an hour, things get serious: I am taken away by three men, and when I ask what I am accused of, I get the answer: violation of the obligation to wear a mask. I reply that I am wearing one, even FFP2, and have been since the group formed. But it is of no use: I should have been wearing the mask before the group formed, and that they have photos to prove that this was not the case. Now that I am away from the others, I only notice out of the corner of my eye that the others who are not wearing masks are far worse off. Maybe because they just wanted to walk through the city and for that reason didn\u2019t have one with them. In any case, I hear commotion and screams, but as a detained person I cannot investigate. After taking my personal details, the police tell me that proceedings will be taken against me and that I am banished from the entire city center. Yet, the police officer in charge is unable to define the boundaries of the area. Instead, he threatens me with imprisonment in case of a violation. Two conclusions Firstly, the police can, through underhanded singling out, pin a case on anyone who is outside their home, and that is probably the point of the action. Secondly, if this cannot be called fascism, where does it actually begin \u2013 or to put it another way, what more do we actually want to put up with?

        "text":"Judge Rules COVID Vaccine Mandate for DC Government Workers Is Unconstitutional A health care worker prepares to administer a vaccine for the prevention of monkeypox in Wilton Manors, Fla., on July 12, 2022. (Joe Raedle\/Getty Images) A D.C. Superior Court judge ruled Thursday that the COVID-19 vaccine mandate imposed on city employees is unlawful. An order that was handed down by Judge Maurice A. Ross was a response to a lawsuit filed by the D.C. Police Union and other groups that opposed Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s mandate. Bowser in August of last year ordered city government employees to provide proof of vaccination although some workers could seek a medical or religious exemption to the shot. \u201cA vaccine mandate is not an everyday exercise of power,\u201d Ross wrote in his 17-page ruling (pdf). \u201cIt is instead a significant encroachment into the life\u2014and health\u2014of an employee. It is strikingly unlike any other workplace regulations typically imposed, as it \u2018cannot be undone at the end of the workday.\u2019 Thus, there is an expectation that a vaccine mandate must come from a legislative body.\u201d Ross also argued that the legal \u201csystem does not permit the Mayor to act unlawfully even in the pursuit of desirable ends,\u201d including curbing COVID-19, adding that \u201cthe Mayor lacks legal authority to impose a vaccine mandate on Plaintiffs.\u201d The judge rejected city lawyers\u2019 arguments that Bowser could impose a vaccine mandate in her capacity to regulate occupational and workplace hazards. The Biden administration made a similar claim to the U.S. Supreme Court last year on its vaccine mandate for private businesses before the court struck the rule down in January. \u201cAlthough COVID-19 is a risk that can occur in many workplaces, it is not an occupational hazard in most,\u201d Ross wrote in his order. Response It means the city can\u2019t enforce the COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Meanwhile, disciplinary actions that were taken to enforce compliance can be reversed, according to Ross\u2019s ruling. The DC Police Union praised the decision and said it will ensure that its officers won\u2019t be terminated or forced to take the vaccine. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser attends March for Our Lives 2022 in Washington on June 11, 2022. (Paul Morigi\/Getty Images for March For Our Lives) \u201cHad the Mayor just engaged the Union in good faith bargaining, we would have reached a reasonable compromise that protected everyone\u2019s interests,\u201d Gregg Pemberton, the chairman of the union, said in a statement. \u201cNow, all of our members can go back to do the necessary work of trying to protect our communities from crime and violence without unlawful threats of discipline and termination.\u201d The office of Bowser, a Democrat, issued a statement Friday to WUSA9 in response to the ruling. \u201cWe are reviewing the Court\u2019s ruling, and believe that the judge misunderstood the strength and diversity of the authorities we relied upon in issuing the employee vaccination mandate,\u201d the statement said, adding that \u201cgoing forward, we will comply with the Court\u2019s orders as we continue encouraging our community to access life-saving vaccines.\u201d Bowser\u2019s statement further claimed that her office believes that \u201cCOVID-19 vaccines work\u201d and \u201csave lives.\u201d Some recent studies, however, have suggested the opposite may be true.",

        "text":"The National Guard is a unique branch of the U.S. military that holds both state and national responsibilities ranging from responding to domestic natural disasters to supporting overseas operations. But tens of thousands of National Guard troops are at risk of being discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine, worrying lawmakers on Capitol Hill that the Guard will be left crippled. Approximately 40,000 National Guard and 22,000 Reserve troops did not receive their COVID vaccines by the June 30 deadline that was set in place by the Biden administration and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. Those who failed to comply were cut off from some benefits and barred from participation in certain military duties. As of July 27, the total number of unvaccinated members of the Guard and Reserve hovers at 39,600.1 Due to both the state and international duties of the Guard, federal officials and governors have argued over who has the final legal say on the vaccine mandates. This has allowed for Guard and Reserve troops to have an extended deadline of seven months longer than other service members. Military Facing Lowest Recruiting Numbers Since Vietnam War Every branch of the military is already facing recruiting difficulties. Military recruitment numbers are the lowest they have been since the Vietnam War. The Army is expecting to reach only 40 percent of its recruitment target for the fiscal year\u2014missing its recruiting goal by 40,000 individuals.2 \u201cWe\u2019re talking about states potentially losing up to 20 percent to 30 percent of their guardsmen and women, replacing them in a very difficult recruiting environment, much less getting them trained to the capability they once were\u201d said Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida. \u201cWhen the next crisis comes to our shores the U.S. will lack the number [of] Guardsmen and women to come to our rescue.\u201d1 Over 1,000 members of the Marine Corps have been discharged for refusal to comply with the vaccine mandate; 469 discharged from the Navy, 287 from the Air Force, and 345 from the Army.3 Pentagon Refuses to Budge on COVID Vaccine Mandates Despite lawmakers, governors, and others pushing back against the mandates, Austin has refused to budge, citing national security. Defense Secretary Austin argues that service members who get COVID disease are not able to work, which jeopardizes the ability to meet combat mission requirements. Secretary Austin wrote to governors that vaccination is key to maintain a healthy military force and to protecting the American people.4 Katherine Kuzminski, director of the Military, Veterans, and Society program, stated: The whole foundation of military action and conflict is based upon the ability to follow through with a lawful order\u2026they don\u2019t necessarily want to retain people who have indicated that they won\u2019t follow a lawful order when it comes to vaccination.1 Several Republican governors are fighting the vaccine mandate for their National Guard troops, with governors from Alaska, Oklahoma, and Texas filing lawsuits over the mandate.3 Rep. Waltz, a 26-year veteran, said: I fully understand\u2026 good order and discipline and \u2018an order is an order\u2019. You order the platoon to charge the machine gun on the top of the hill, they\u2019ve got to follow it. But I also think it\u2019s incumbent on us as leaders to constantly evaluate the cost and the risk of our orders. Maybe charging that hill is going to be too costly to that unit.1 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

        "link":"https:\/\/thevaccinereaction.org\/2022\/08\/most-american-parents-rejecting-covid-vaccine-for-young-children\/",
        "text":"Despite the recommendation by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that young children between the ages of six months and four years get vaccinated for COVID-19, only four to five percent of children in this age group have received the controversial mRNA COVID vaccines distributed by Pfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna for administration to young children under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). The COVID vaccine uptake rate for infants and young children is in stark contrast to that for older children between the ages of five to 11, which started at 18 percent a month after the shots were approved for that age group and is currently at 38 percent.1 According to Vaccine Monitor published by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), as of July 2022, only 17 percent of parents with children between the ages of six months and four years old have had their children receive COVID shots or have indicated they plan to give them \u201cright away.\u201d This number has slightly declined from KFF\u2019s Vaccine Monitor survey conducted in April, which showed that 18 percent\u2014or one in five parents\u2014planned to vaccinate their young children \u201cright away.\u201d2 3 More than four in ten parents (43 percent) say that they will \u201cdefinitely not\u201d give COVID shots to children under age four, including babies as young as six months old.4 In April, only 27 percent of parents with children in that age group said that they would \u201cdefinitely not\u201d give the shots to their infants and children.5 Parents cited the following reasons for not getting their young children the mRNA COVID biologic: concerns about the vaccine being so new with little testing and research (19 percent); potential side effects (14 percent); safety (13 percent) and not worried about COVID\/doesn\u2019t need it (11 percent).6 Seven in ten parents admitted that they are \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d concerned that the COVID shots are not effective in preventing infections and their child would get sick, regardless of being vaccinated.7 When surveyed, parents of all ethnicities and political parties expressed concerns over the new COVID vaccine. A White, Independent politically leaning father in Wisconsin said the vaccine, \u201cHas not been around long enough for adequate research,\u201d while a Black Democrat leaning mother in California said, \u201cI think it\u2019s still too new and I\u2019m worried about any long-term side effects.\u201d A White Democrat mother in Maine admitted, \u201cI don\u2019t really trust the FDA. The Pfizer vaccine efficacy is so low, it makes me wonder about everything\u201d and an Hispanic Republican mother in Iowa said, \u201cWe haven\u2019t followed \u2018guidelines\u2019 for safety and are just fine, have no case of COVID, and continue our daily lives, and have not ever been affected. The vaccine does not prevent COVID.\u201d8 According to Marty Makary, MD, a surgeon and public policy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, the sweeping vaccine recommendations by the CDC were based on extremely weak and inconclusive data by the vaccine manufacturers. He said: Parents are not falling for it. After nearly a month of the government heavily pushing vaccines for kids under 5, only 3% have chosen to get their kids under 5 vaccinated. More parents believe in UFOs, I think.9 COVID Vaccination Rates Vary by State Parents have been hesitant to vaccinate young children, even in California, a state that mandates all CDC-recommended childhood vaccines for school attendance with few exceptions10 and plans to mandate the COVID vaccination for all school children by 2023.11 As of Aug. 2, 2022, only 6.4 percent of the 2.2 million children aged five and younger in California have been vaccinated. Fifty-three percent of parents in California believe the COVID shots are more of a risk to their young child\u2019s health than contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus.12 In New Jersey, 4.5 percent of young children have received at least one does of COVID vaccine; in Arkansas 1.8 percent have gotten one dose,;4.3 percent have been vaccinated in Kansas; 8.8 percent have had the shot in Washington state; whereas in Massachusetts, 11 percent have had one dose.13 14 15 Florida did not preorder any COVID shots for children under five, but the state allows doctors to order the shots through a state-run portal.16 States with the lowest vaccine uptake rate are ordering fewer doses than other states, which reportedly concerns health officials. A CDC spokesman concluded that the low vaccine uptake was due to the shots being rolled out over two holiday weekends.17 Since parents are hesitant to give their young children COVID vaccine, the CDC has taken to encouraging doctors to vaccinate more children, especially doctors enrolled in the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. VFC is a federal program that gives free shots to children without health insurance, those on Medicaid, and American Indians and Alaskan natives. As many as three-quarters of VCF providers plan to administer COVID shots to their youngest patients.18 Parents Were Hesitant Vaccinate Their Young Children Before the Shots Were Approved Another nationwide study by the University of Iowa showed that less than half of the 2,031 parents surveyed intended to give their very young children COVID shots. The parents answered an online questionnaire in February about their intention to vaccinate their young children once the COVID shots received approval from the FDA. Some 47.3 percent of the parents said they wanted to wait at least three months after the COVID shots were approved for infants and young children, while 45.6 percent said that they would \u201cdefinitely\u201d or \u201cprobably\u201d give their child the shot. About 30.5 percent of the parents wanted more information about the safety of the COVID shots, while 28.3 percent wanted more information on effectiveness.19 Despite the lukewarm reception of parents to the CDC\u2019s recommendation to give COVID vaccine to very young children, public health officials were eager to announce the approval of the vaccine for infants and young children in June. Jack Resneck, MD and president of the American Medical Association (AMA), said, To unanimously recommend use of both the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines for children as young as six months of age is a vital step in protecting many more children from COVID-19. Many parents across the U.S. have anxiously awaited a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine for their children\u2014having foregone normal daily activities for the past several years to protect their youngest children from the virus. Parents will breathe a sigh of relief knowing these vaccines will very soon be available.20 U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said: A vaccine for children under five would mean we would have vaccines available for essentially all age groups in America. This would be a major milestone. I\u2019m hopeful that we may be one step closer to having an added layer of protection for our younger children, and one less worry for their parents.21 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

        "text":"Techniker Krankenkasse, Germany\u2019s largest health insurance company, reported that 437,593 of 11 million (1 in 25) insured individuals in 2021 had to undergo medical treatment as a result of adverse reactions from COVID-19 shots.1 COVID shots currently approved for use in Germany include Novavax\u2019s Nuvaxovid, Moderna\u2019s Spikevax, Pfizer\/BioNTech\u2019s Comirnaty, Johnson & Johnson\/Janssen\u2019s Ad26.COV2.S, AstraZeneca\/Oxford University\u2019s Vaxzevria, and Valneva\u2019s VLA2001.2 Ministry of Health Acknowledges One in 5,000 COVID Shots Cause Serious Reactions The German Ministry of Health officially acknowledged that 1 in every 5,000 COVID Shots given will cause serious adverse reactions that lead to hospitalization, permanent disability or death. The Ministry of Health said a person who gets four shots has a one in 1,250 chance of developing a severe adverse reaction.3 Following this announcement by the German Ministry of Health, the German Federation of Hospitals called for the vaccine mandate for healthcare personnel to be revoked. Henriette Neumeyer, vice chairwoman of the board for the German Federation of Hospitals said: According to the current findings, it is not sensible and not transferable to continue.4 Techniker Krankenkasse reported that in 2019, out of 11 million insured people, 13,777 medical treatments were required as a result of vaccine side effects. In 2020, 15,044 medical treatments were carried out as a result of vaccine reactions. In 2021, the figure significantly grew to 437,593 medical treatments following vaccine reactions, an increase of more than 3,000 percent. Based on the Techniker Krankenkasse data, as many as 1 in 500 COVID shots causes a serious reaction.5 Company Board Member Fired for Revealing COVID Shot Reaction Data In February 2022, Andreas Sch\u00f6fbeck, a board member of BKK ProVita, one of Germany\u2019s oldest health insurance companies, revealed that he noticed that the number of doctor visits as a result of COVID shot reactions among the millions of insured customers was no less than ten times higher than the official figures. According to Sch\u00f6fbeck , no less than three million Germans would have had to visit a doctor as a result of COVID vaccinations.6 Sch\u00f6fbeck said that he began to be concerned when BKK ProVita\u2019s case management increasingly came across diagnoses of adverse reactions from COVID vaccination. He began investigating the data, which revealed that from the start of 2021 through the middle of the third quarter of 2021, 216,695 BKK ProVita policyholders had been treated for adverse reactions to COVID shots. Sch\u00f6fbeck was then fired from his position at BKK ProVita for releasing the data.7 In comparison, the Paul Ehrlich Institute, Germany\u2019s medical regulatory body and research institution for vaccines and biomedicines, had only registered 244,576 reports of adverse reactions due to COVID shots based on 61.4 million vaccinated people by the end of 2021. At the beginning of July 2021, the National Association of Physicians of Statutory Health Insurance (KBV) confirmed that Sch\u00f6fbeck\u2019s estimates were probably correct. KBV revealed that nearly 2.5 million German ctizens went to the doctor in 2021 due to adverse reactions to COVID shots.8 BKK ProVita, KBV and Techniker Krankenkasse\u2019s data shows that the actual number of severe adverse reactions from COVID shots is much higher than originally predicted.9 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

        "text":"Pediatrician Paul Halczenko, MD awaits a decision in an appeal he filed against Ascension Health, his employer for the last ten years. Dr. Halczenko and four other health care workers, were put on leave from their job at Peyton Manning Children\u2019s Hospital at Ascension St. Vincent Hospital after refusing to be vaccinated for COVID-19 for religious reasons when it was mandated as a condition of employment for 14,700 employees in Indiana.1 2 Dr. Halczenko is one of only three pediatric intensive care unit doctors in Indiana. He and four other health care workers sued Ascension and St. Vincent Hospital for violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act \u201cby systematically and callously failing to accommodate their religious beliefs and denying their requests for exemption without giving individualized consideration of, or individualized responses to, each request.\u201d3 Doctor Alleges Religious Discrimination The four other health care workers who filed suit along with the doctor were allowed to return to work when Ascension repealed the vaccine mandate in December 2021. However, Dr. Halczenko, who works in critical care for pediatric patients, was told that he was not allowed to return to work.4 William Bock III, attorney for the doctor, points out that no reason was given as to why the doctor was singled out and prevented from returning to work along with the other previously suspended workers. He said: We have no explanation for why Dr. Halczenko is treated differently. We believe that it\u2019s religious discrimination.5 Dr. Halczenko argued that, should he not be granted a preliminary injunction and be allowed to return to work, his skills as a highly specialized pediatric intensive care doctor as well as his reputation would suffer irreparable harm. However, Judge James Patrick Hanlon denied the doctor\u2019s request for a temporary injunction stating that he found that the doctor, \u201chas failed to make a \u2018substantial showing\u2019 of irreparable injury\u201d that would necessitate him being reinstated in his position by way of a temporary injunction.6 The court stated that, should he prevail on the Title VII claims, Dr. Halczenko could ultimately be made whole without the court issuing a preliminary injunction.7 At the same time, the court noted that Ascension provided almost no supporting evidence as to the reason why the doctor\u2019s religious exemption was denied, but concluded that the defendant\u2019s motivation behind the denial of the accommodation is not a matter to be resolved at a preliminary injunction hearing. Doctor Argues the COVID Vaccine Does Not Prevent Transmission of Infection The judge, failing to find that the doctor\u2019s reputation would suffer an irreparable injury as a result of being put on administrative leave due to his religious beliefs, wrote: And, here the claimed reputational injury\u2014and corresponding impediment to finding a comparable job\u2014would arise from the undisputed, truthful fact that Dr. Halczenko\u2019s employment was terminated because he did not get vaccinated against COVID-19\u201d8 Dr. Halczenko defended his position, saying: Well, first I would say I am following the science. The preponderance of the evidence suggests and even as we know no \u2014not necessarily at the time of the lawsuit, but certainly in the intervening weeks and months\u2014that vaccination does not actually prevent transmission. So, the best protection that I can offer to my patients is to use the personal protective equipment and the other measures that are employed by health care workers across the world and have been demonstrated to be effective.9 Ascension responded to these allegations\u2026 It is in the public\u2019s interest to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and reduce the risk of serious illness to St. Vincent\u2019s patients, employees, and visitors. This public interest in reducing the risk of transmission among patients and employees outweighs any interest asserted by Halczenko.10 This matter was heard before the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals on May 31 and a decision is pending.11 Ascension Health Faces More Lawsuits Due to Its COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate A group of 64 health care workers are also suing Ascension Health and St. Vincent Hospital in a class action lawsuits for having been suspended without pay after they refused to take the COVID-19 vaccine. The employees objected to the vaccine on religious grounds and filed religious exemption to the vaccine mandate. The employees argue that Ascension failed to properly assess each individual religious exemption application.[12] The lawsuit alleges: Ascension Health established a coercive process calculated to force healthcare workers and staff to abandon their religious objections to the COVID-19 vaccination and receive the vaccination against their will.13 The employees were suspended without pay beginning Nov. 12, 2021 and told that, if they failed to get the vaccine by Jan. 4, 2022, they would be fired. In December, Ascension repealed the vaccine mandate and allowed the employees who filed a religious exemption to return to work. The employees are requesting that Ascension be found guilty of violating federal discrimination laws and be ordered to pay them for the time they were suspended, as well as other compensation.14 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

        "text":"NorthShore University HealthSystem (NorthShore), which operates six hospitals in the Chicago area, agreed to pay approximately $10.3 million to employees who were discriminated against and denied religious exemptions from the Biden administration\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine mandate in an historic class action settlement against a private employer.1 2 3 Liberty Counsel filed a class action lawsuit against the healthcare provider in federal court, together with a motion for a temporary restraining order and injunction after Northshore refused to comply with an October 2021 demand letter requesting religious exemptions for about 523 employees. Approximately 204 of the employees agreed to take the COVID vaccine despite their religious beliefs and 269 resigned or were fired for their refusal to violate their religious beliefs and take the shot.4 5 The employees alleged that almost all COVID vaccine religious exemption requests were initially denied and, when a few religious exemptions were eventually granted, only remote work was offered as an accommodation, which is not suited for many healthcare positions. NorthShore ignored the employees offers to be regularly tested, wear masks and report if they had symptoms instead of getting the vaccine.6 7 Class Action Settlement Agreement Signed The class action settlement agreement signed by both parties stipulates that employees who were fired or forced to resign when they refused to take the novel vaccine will receive approximately $25,000 each, while employees who took the shot in order to keep their jobs despite their religious beliefs, will get about $3,000 each. The 13 lead plaintiffs expect to get an additional $20,000.8 Employees who lost their jobs for failing to take the controversial vaccine may apply to be rehired with their religious exemption request granted and all previous benefits and seniority intact, as long as they reapply within 90 days.9 While NorthShore has not admitted to any wrongdoing, the hospital agreed to end their policy of denying all religious exemptions and will no longer discriminate or retaliate against employees who request religious exemptions or accommodations to vaccination. Rather, NorthShore will evaluate religious exemption requests and if approved, offer accommodations in compliance with federal law.10 11 Liberty Counsel Vice President Horatio G. Mihet said: We are very pleased with the historic, $10 million settlement achieved in our class action lawsuit against NorthShore University HealthSystem. The drastic policy change and substantial monetary relief required by the settlement will bring a strong measure of justice to NorthShore\u2019s employees, who were callously forced to choose between their conscience and their jobs. This settlement should also serve as a strong warning to employers across the nation that they cannot refuse to accommodate those with sincere religious objections to forced vaccination mandates.12 Title VII Protections Do Not Pause for COVID-19 Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which is enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, protects employees from religious discrimination in the workplace. Employees who inform their employer that their sincerely held religious beliefs prevent them from complying with a mandatory work requirement are protected from discrimination and retaliation in the workplace under Title VII. Employers have an affirmative obligation to seriously consider the request, enter into good faith talks and offer appropriate accommodations.13 Liberty Counsel alleges that NorthShore\u2019s actions violated Title VII when they did not consider each religious exemption individually and provide reasonable accommodations to workers with sincerely held religious beliefs.14 15 In response to the settlement, labor and employment attorney Margo Wolf O\u2019Donnell said: \u201cIf there is a vaccine mandate, it\u2019s important that requests for exemptions, whether they be religious or medical exemption requests, they be considered on a case-by-case basis. Employers still can have vaccine mandates. I just think they need to be implemented appropriately.16 The plaintiffs also alleged that NorthShore\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine policy was contrary to the Illinois Health Care Rights of Conscience Act17 and federal law regarding vaccines approved for Emergency Use because employees were not allowed to decline the vaccine. Federal law provides: [A]s a condition of receiving authorization for Emergency Use, all individuals to whom the product may be administered are given the right to accept or refuse administration of the product.18 NorthShore said of the settlement, \u201cWe continue to support systemwide, evidence-based vaccination requirements for everyone who works at NorthShore\u2014Edward-Elmhurst Health and thank our team members for helping to keep our communities safe.19 Founder and Chairman of Liberty Counsel Matt Staver warned: This settlement should be a wake-up call to every employer that did not accommodate or exempt employees who opposed the COVID shots for religious reasons. Let this case be a warning to employers that violated Title VII. It is especially significant and gratifying that this first classwide COVID settlement protects health care workers. Health care workers are heroes who daily give their lives to protect and treat their patients. They are needed now more than ever.20 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

        "text":"On Aug. 4, 2022, the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) reported the death of an individual in South Africa shortly after receiving Johnson & Johnson\/Janssen\u2019s adenovirus vectored Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine. The agency stated that the death was causally linked to the vaccine.1 2 3 4 5 The name and age of the person who died was withheld for reasons of confidentiality, and death occurred after the polio-like neurological disorder Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) developed soon after the vaccination. The individual was placed on a ventilator and subsequently died.2 \u201c[GBS] can be mild but it can also lead to either rapid or progressive weakness and has the potential to affect the respiratory system,\u201d said Marc Blockman, MBChB, MMED, professor of clinical pharmacology at the University of Cape Town and Groote Schuur Hospital. \u201cIt could be caused by bacterial or viral infections and certain medicines or vaccines could predispose patients to develop the syndrome. We were acutely aware of it and it was part of the vigilance plan.\u201d1 7 Other Possible Cases of GBS in South Africa After J&J COVID Shot This GBS case developing after COVID vaccination is one out of about 160 deaths possibly associated with Ad26.COV2.S vaccinations in South Africa. It was the only one reviewed by SAHPRA and determined to be caused by the vaccine. In the other cases, the deaths reportedly were believed by health officials to have been coincidental.1 5 \u201cAt the time of illness no other cause for the Guillain-Barre syndrome could be identified,\u201d said Professor Hannelie Meyer, MSc, PhD, head of the South African Vaccination and Immunisation Centre (SAVIC) at Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University in Pretoria. \u201cThe person presented with the symptoms shortly after vaccination and this had led to prolonged hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and further infections.\u201d1 2 7 FDA Warns of GBS Risk With J&J COVID Vaccine The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine has also been associated with GBS in the United States. On July 12, 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a warning to the fact sheet for Ad26.COV2.S following reports of 100 cases of GBS among those who received the vaccine. Nine-five of those cases were apparently severe enough to require hospitalization, and one of those individuals died. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most of the cases were \u201creported about two weeks after vaccination and mostly in males, many aged 50 years and older.\u201d8 9 10 The head of SAHPRA, Boitumelo Semete-Makokotlela, PhD, MMFI, said that investigations of other deaths in South Africa that may be linked to the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine are ongoing. Nicholas Crisp, MD, the deputy director-general of South Africa\u2019s National Department of Health, said that a government compensation fund for people harmed by COVID-19 vaccinations has received 75 claims and additional cases are being investigated.1 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

        "text":"America First Legal (AFL), a non-profit organization based in Washington, DC that works to defend American citizens from unconstitutional government overreach, released documents from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealing evidence of collusion between the CDC and major social media corporations to censor free speech on the COVID-19 pandemic and promote a COVID narrative set forth by federal government agencies.1 2 White House Admitted To Working With Facebook to Limit \u201cMisinformation\u201d in 2021 In 2021, former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that the Biden administration was working in collaboration with Facebook to limit misinformation on COVID vaccines.3 Psaki stated: So we\u2019re regularly making sure social media platforms are aware of the latest narratives, dangerous to public health that we and many other Americans are seeing across all of social and traditional media. And we work to engage with them to better understand the enforcement of social media platform policies.4 Psaki also said that if a user is banned for spreading \u201cmisinformation\u201d on one social media platform, they should be banned from all other social media platforms as well.5 She noted that the federal government does not directly get involved in controlling information on social media sites but that social media companies make those decisions. Psaki said: We don\u2019t take anything down. We don\u2019t block anything, Facebook, and any private sector company makes decisions about what information should be on their platform. Our point is that there is information that is leading to people not taking the vaccine.6 America First Legal Sues CDC to Release Records on Censorship Following Psaki\u2019s press conference in 2021, AFL submitted Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for documents, records and communications relating to the Biden administration decision to direct social media companies to censor speech pertaining to the COVID pandemic on their platforms.7 Stephen Miller, President of AFL stated: Jen Psaki has unwittingly confirmed a shocking truth: the White House is using massive Big Tech companies as a censorship arm of the federal government. If true, this means that Big Tech censorship is state censorship and thus facially unconstitutional. There is no dividing line between government and big tech\u2014it is an incestuous union, and you cannot tell where one ends and one begins\u2026 AFL is filing these urgent FOIA requests so the full scope of this earth-shaking scandal will be revealed\u2014and so that, in turn, this unconstitutional behavior can be ended.8 The FOIA requests were delayed, after which AFL took further action and filed a lawsuit against the CDC on Apr. 8, 2022 to the release all information in order to assess CDC\u2019s collaboration with social media companies in determining what it deemed as COVID \u201cmisinformation\u201d.9 Gene Hamilton, Vice President and General Counsel of AFL said: What is surprising is that it took litigation to pry these records loose from the federal government, and that the Administration apparently has no qualms about violating the First Amendment in pursuit of its ideological goals. The federal government is not the arbiter of truth for the American people.10 High Level Coordination Between CDC and Social Media Corps to Censor COVID Information After filing the lawsuit, AFL was able to obtain 286 pages of documents revealing communications between federal agencies and social media companies on how to censor information on COVID on their platforms. The documents can be found here.11 The documents reveal that CDC worked very closely with Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Google to control information about COVID. An e-mail between CDC and Todd O\u2019Boyle, Senior Manager of Public Policy at Twitter and other Twitter officials showed a chart of tweets deemed to be \u201cmisinformation\u201d. The same email mentions regular BOLO (Be On the Look Out) meetings where CDC would share what they categorized as \u201cmisinformation\u201d with various social media companies.12 In another e-mail, CDC stated to Twitter officials that any contextual information should be added to posts about Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) such as \u201cVAERS accepts reports from anyone, including patients, family members, healthcare providers and vaccine manufacturers. VAERS is not designed to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event. A report to VAERS does not mean the vaccine caused the event.\u201d13 Facebook Offered DHHS Millions in Free Ads to Promote COVID Vaccines, Social Distancing The CDC also emailed a list of links to Facebook officials to flag as \u201cmisinformation.\u201d The agency said that it observed considerable \u201cmisinformation\u201d on topics relating to COVID vaccine shedding and microchips that they wanted to censor.14 The documents also show an e-mail in which Facebook officials offered $15 million worth of Facebook advertisement credits as a \u201cnon-monetary gift\u201d to HHS and CDC for messages relating to vaccines, social distancing and travel.15 In another e-mail, the CDC asked Google officials to promote their new website on COVID vaccines to appear first on their search engine. In another e-mail, the CDC requested Google to post an advertisement for a job position at the CDC.16 Request for Investigation Into CDC & Big Tech\u2019s \u201cCovert Propaganda\u201d Campaign On Aug. 2, 2022, AFL wrote a letter to Christi A. Grimm, Inspector General of HHS requesting an investigation into the collaboration between the CDC and social media companies. The letter states: Accordingly, we now write to request that your office investigate the U.S. Department of Health Human Services (\u201cDepartment\u201d) to determine whether the Department, through its agency the Centers for Disease Control (\u201cCDC\u201d), has colluded with social media companies, including Facebook, Google, and Twitter, and digital marketing firms, including Reingold, to unlawfully disseminate covert propaganda.17 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

        "text":"Pfizer and BioNTech will have to answer in court to legal claims by Moderna that they copied its innovative messenger RNA (mRNA) technology in the making of their COVID-19 biologic, Comirnaty. The patent infringement lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts and the Regional Court of Dusseldorf in Germany alleges that Moderna filed patents from 2010-2016 for its mRNA technology, which the company ultimately used to create the COVID biologic, Spikevax, and that that Moderna\u2019s technology was unlawfully copied by Pfizer and BioNTech.1 The lawsuit demands that Moderna be financially compensated for the allegedly stolen technology but does not ask that their competitor\u2019s vaccine be removed from the market. Moderna contends that Pfizer and BioNTech stole two critical pieces of technology from Moderna and used it to produce Comirnaty. They allege that Pfizer and BioNTech copied Moderna\u2019s mRNA chemical modifications that \u201cencode for the full-length spike protein in a lipid nanoparticle formulation for a coronavirus.\u201d2 Moderna states that it developed this technology when Moderna researchers first worked on developing a biologic for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2015 and 2016, long before the SARS-CoV-2 virus appeared in 2020.3 Moderna Announced in 2020 That It Would Not Enforce Its mRNA Technology Patent Rights Moderna has only been operating for a decade-old, but it has been a leader in mRNA technology. BioNTech had also been actively developing biologics using mRNA technology prior to partnering with Pfizer to fast track the development of Comirnaty in response to the declaration of a global coronavirus pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in early 2020. In December 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to the Pfizer\/BioNTech team and then to Moderna a week later to distribute the experimental COVID shots.4 Initially, Moderna announced that it would not enforce its mRNA technology patent rights in order to assist other drug companies with the development of COVID vaccines that could curtail the pandemic. However, in March 2022 the Massachusetts-based company declared that they would be enforcing their intellectual property rights after all. The Moderna lawsuit does not seek damages for Pfizer sales activity prior to Mar. 8, 2022 or for sales made to 92 lower and middle-income countries.5 Moderna\u2019s CEO, St\u00e9phane Bancel, said: We are filing these lawsuits to protect the innovative mRNA technology platform that we pioneered, invested billions of dollars in creating, and patented during the decade preceding the COVID-19 pandemic\u2026 This foundational platform, which we began building in 2010, along with our patented work on coronaviruses in 2015 and 2016, enabled us to produce a safe and highly effective Covid-19 vaccine in record time after the pandemic struck.6 Pfizer Will \u201cVigorously\u201d Defend Against the Allegations Pfizer and BioNTech deny all patent infringement claims by Moderna.7 Jorge Contreras, law professor at the University of Utah and expert on patents, believes that Moderna\u2019s original announcement that it would not enforce its patent was a binding commitment and may protect Pfizer and BioNTech from liability. Moderna\u2019s March announcement that it was rescinding part of its offer to share their patented technology did not overrule its initial pledge. Contreras said: This was a public, formal statement from a public company through a press release, so it\u2019s reasonable for other companies to rely on it.8 Moderna\u2019s lawsuit is not the only lawsuit contending that Pfizer and BioNTech infringed on other company patents when developing Comirnaty. CureVac of Germany has also sued BioNTech for patent infringement.9 Pfizer claims it was surprised by the lawsuit and contends it will \u201cvigorously defend against the allegations.\u201d10 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

        "text":"The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, Louisiana, in a change of heart from its Apr. 7, 2022 decision, agreed to hear arguments against the Biden administration\u2019s vaccine mandate for federal workers. The court will hear the matter en banc which means that there will be a full panel of judges convened. This decision vacates the court\u2019s previous ruling which reinstated the vaccine mandate for federal workers. Therefore, the COVID-19 vaccine mandate for federal workers has once again been paused.1 2 3 Implementation of the COVID vaccine mandate will be delayed until at least September when the full court will hear arguments. The Biden administration has announced that they will not process or make any decisions regarding medical or religious exemptions to the mandate or suspend or fire any workers for failing to comply with President Biden\u2019s mandate pending the court\u2019s decision.4 The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals previous decision reinstated the vaccine mandate for federal workers based on the court\u2019s conclusion that the president of the United States has the power to order to federal employees to get vaccinated, while federal judges do not have jurisdiction to interfere. Because the court found that they did not have authority to override the president in matters like this, the judges did not rule on the merits of the case. In September, the same court en banc may be more likely to consider all arguments and make a decision on the merits of the case.5 History of the COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate for Federal Workers In September 2021, the Biden administration ordered that all federal workers receive a COVID vaccination as a condition of employment. In January 2022, however, a Federal District Court in Texas issued a preliminary injunction against the mandate, which halted the vaccine requirement for federal workers. The court blocked the mandate, finding that it exceeded the President\u2019s authority and required Congressional approval.6 The judges ruled: \u2026 no legal remedy adequately protects the liberty interests of employees who must choose between violating a mandate of doubtful validity or consenting to an unwanted medical procedure that cannot be undone.7 The Biden administration appealed the decision. In February, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Texas District Court\u2019s temporary injunction pending the outcome of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals final ruling.8 On Apr. 7, however, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found for the Biden administration and held that the federal vaccine mandate must be reinstated, and the case dismissed. The court held that a federal judge does not have jurisdiction over federal employees challenging the vaccine mandate and redress is found exclusively under Civil Service Law.9 The court said that the President, as CEO of the executive branch, has proper authority to issue a mandate on federal employees.10 Advocacy Group Feds for Medical Freedom Presses On The ruling reinstating the mandate effective May 23, faced a challenge when an advocacy group called Feds for Medical Freedom and other interested parties filed a petition seeking to overturn the decision and requested that the full 17-member court hear new arguments in the matter.11 Feds for Medical Freedom, which has over 6,000 members, argues that the President\u2019s unilateral decision to affect the lives of millions of federal employees is, \u201ca matter of exceptional importance,\u201d which necessitates a hearing en banc. The group also contends that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s April opinion contradicts previous court precedent with regard to pre-enforcement challenges.12 Marcus Thronton, president of Feds for Medical Freedom, pointed out the high stakes of this case stating: A policy that threatens to derail or end the careers of dedicated public servants who do not consent to take a COVID vaccine is both unconstitutional and immoral.13 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

        "text":"Officials in some cities in China have ordered all indoor pets belonging to SARS-CoV-2 patients to be killed due to fear that the animals could transmit the virus to other humans.1 Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, which reportedly originated in a wet food market or biohazard lab in Wuhan, China in late 2019, government officials in China have been implementing a zero-transmission policy in an attempt to eradicate the virus. Chinese public health officials believe the zero-COVID policy will stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 but,2 despite taking more and more extreme measures to prevent transmission of the virus.3 4 U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials have stated that the risk of animals spreading SARS-CoV-2 to human beings is low but that the virus can spread from people to animals during close contact.5 Public Health Officials Tell Anci District to Kill Pets of SARS-CoV-2 Patients On the morning of Mar. 30, 2022, Anci District Prevention and Control Office issued a notice stating: In order to ensure the safety of positive patients returning home, after communicating with the Langfang City Center for Disease Control and Prevention, it is necessary to comprehensively and thoroughly kill the animals domesticated by positive patients as soon as possible.6 The Office of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau of Anci District, which is responsible for designating professional culling teams, confirmed that it had received the notice from public health officials at the Anci District Prevention and Control Office.7 By 5:00 pm on Mar. 30, 2022, reportedly the \u201corder\u201d had been halted due to public outrage. It is not known how many pets had been killed before the order was suspended.8 Pets Reportedly Killed While Owners Were in Quarantine A Chinese woman who identified herself as Ms. Fu said that she was asked to quarantine in the city of Shangrao after government contact tracers said she had been in close contact with someone who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. She tested negative for the virus.9 She was not able to quarantine with her dog. However, community workers assured her the corgi would be taken care of in her home while she was away. Home security camera showed community workers taking Ms. Fu\u2019s dog away, after which he was killed. The video went viral on China\u2019s social media platform known as Weibo, causing public outrage.10 Another woman from the city of Harbin said that her three cats were killed in September 2021 while she was in quarantine. It has been also reported that authorities in cities of Chengdu and Wuxi have entered homes of people that are in quarantine and killed their pets.11 During the course of the coronavirus pandemic, authorities in China have killed pets on several occasions, resulting in conflicts between local governments and citizens.12 Metal Barriers Go Up in Shanghai Apartment Complexes Associated Press reported on Apr. 24 that Chinese officials were erecting metal barrier fences in neighborhoods around buildings and apartment complexes in Shanghai, where they believe people are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Apparently, public health officials have identified more than 21,000 new COVID-19 cases with most of the cases being asymptomatic and driven by the omicron variant circulating in Shanghai.13 According to the AP story, many residents in the city have had trouble getting groceries and access to medical care because of the barriers and strict controls on movement. A video circulated on the internet earlier in April heard Chinese people subjected to draconian lockdown measures screaming from their apartments \u201cSend us food!

        "text":"Jacob Puliyel, MD, a pediatrician in India for more than 40 years, brought suit in the Supreme Court of India against the Union of India and COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers in a legal challenge to the country\u2019s COVID vaccine program.1 Dr. Puliyel, who has served as Director of Research and Projects at Holy Family Hospital in Delhi and is a former member of the National Technical Advisory Group (NTAG) on immunizations in India, sued the government and COVID vaccine manufacturers seeking release of information related to the COVID vaccine approval process, as well as arguing for a policy change that allows unvaccinated persons to enter public spaces and access resources. Specifically, Dr. Puliyel asked the Supreme Court of India for the release of each phase of clinical trial data for the COVID vaccines administered in India; disclosure of minutes from the meeting of the Subject Expert Committee and the NTGAI with regard to vaccines; release of information surrounding the approval or rejection of emergency use applications of vaccines by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI); and disclosure of post vaccination data related to COVID. He also asked the court to declare that all COVID vaccine mandates are unconstitutional and a violation of h2citizen\u2019s rights. Dr. Puliyel: COVID Vaccines Do Not Prevent Infection or Transmission In support of his request, Dr. Puliyel submitted affidavits to the court stating that natural immunity from SARS-CoV-2 is superior to vaccine acquired immunity and that vaccines do not prevent infection or transmission of COVID. News articles were submitted to show that two-thirds of the population in India had already been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have antibodies to the virus, and that the vaccinated were susceptible to breakthrough infections. Dr. Puliyel also argued that vaccine mandates and restrictions on the unvaccinated are meaningless because the virus is transmitted by the vaccinated and unvaccinated alike. The government maintained that the COVID vaccines administered in India, Covaxin and Covishield, are needed to combat the global pandemic threat. They also maintained that trial data cannot be released to the public due to privacy concerns; that information regarding adverse events has already been released; that vaccination remains voluntary for all citizens, and that restrictions on the unvaccinated were necessary to protect the public health. Respondent COVID vaccine manufacturers argued that they followed strict guidelines for government approval of their COVID vaccines. The Union of India strongly opposed this lawsuit, claiming that the publicity could increase vaccine hesitancy and endanger the public health, and that public health matters should not be interfered with by the court. However, because Dr. Puliyel brought this lawsuit in the interest of the public and because he is considered a subject matter expert, the Court determined the case would be heard for the welfare of the public. The Supreme Court of India Looked to High Courts in Other Countries The government made their argument relying on prominent cases in India, as well as U.S. cases, such as Jacobson v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Zucht v. King; Biden vs. Missouri, and Roman Catholic Diocese v. Cuomo. The court also looked to New South Wales for guidance, finding that the Supreme Court in Assam v. Hazzard held that it was not the court\u2019s role to determine the effectiveness of the government\u2019s regulations or whether the regulations were the best response to the risks COVID posed to the public, instead the New South Whales Supreme Court emphasized that their only role was to determine the legal validity of the Minister\u2019s orders. Reviewing India\u2019s case history, the Court summarized its role in reviewing policy decisions: to check whether it violates the fundamental rights of the citizens or is opposed to the provisions of the Constitution, or opposed to any statutory provision or manifestly arbitrary\u201d but not to, \u201csubstitute their own views as to what is wise, safe, prudent or proper. 2 In Distribution of Essential Supplies & Services during Pandemic, the Court determined that it would not, \u201csecond guess\u201d the policy experts, but would \u201cexercise jurisdiction to determine if the chosen policy measure conforms to the standards of reasonableness, militates against manifest arbitrariness and protects the right to life of all persons.\u201d3 Court Found Forced Vaccination Violates the Constitution of India In considering the global pandemic, the court said that it could not find fault with the government\u2019s vaccination drive, citing the highly transmissible Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2; the approximate loss of 5,23,843 lives from the virus in India; and the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), TAG-CO-VAC and SAGE that vaccination would provide strong protection against serious illness, hospitalization and death. However, regarding the issue of the right of individual privacy verses the government restricting individual rights in the name of public health, the Supreme Court of India found that forced vaccination is a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The Court previously found in Article 21 a right to personal autonomy, which extends to the right to refuse medical treatment. In balancing the state\u2019s interest in public health and an individual\u2019s right to personal autonomy, the court found that Article 21 of the Indian Constitution grants individuals the right to determine how they should live their own life, which includes the right to refuse medical treatment such as vaccination. However, when there is a likelihood that an individual could spread the virus to other people, the state\u2019s interest in protecting the public allows the government to impose certain restrictions on individual rights, as long as such restrictions are reasonable, in proportion to the objective sought, and reviewable by the courts. Accordingly, the Court found that the government\u2019s restrictions are a valid exercise of power, despite evidence that an unvaccinated person is no more likely to spread the Delta or Omicron variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus than a vaccinated person. The Court: COVID Vaccination Policy in India Not Unreasonable In support of his case, Dr. Puliyel presented scientific journals showing that patients who recovered from COVID still had antibodies 11 months after infection. He also pointed out that countries with a higher percent of the population vaccinated have a higher rate of COVID per one million people. He said that a vaccine surveillance report in the United Kingdom showed that, in week 40, there was a negative efficacy of the vaccine in those over the age of 30. The court confirmed that its only role is to determine whether the Union of India took into consideration scientific research when establishing its policy advocating COVID vaccination for the entire country. The court acknowledged that large portions of the public cannot be considered healthy because they suffer from chronic disease and lack of nutrition, especially the elderly population, and that the Union of India\u2019s vaccination policy was rightly centered around large segments of more vulnerable people, rather than a minority who are healthy as the subjects in the scientific articles that Dr. Puliyel presented to support the efficacy of natural immunity. Accordingly, the court found that the COVID vaccination policy of India was made in the interest of public health and is not unreasonable. The Court: Vaccinated Population a Source of Virus Transmission Considering the fact that the vaccinated and the unvaccinated pose nearly the same risk of transmitting the virus, the court looked at whether the Union of India\u2019s vaccination policy of restricting unvaccinated persons from accessing public resources amounted to discrimination. Dr. Puliyel presented a letter published in the Lancet finding that peak viral load of COVID did not differ either by vaccination status or by variant; that the secondary infection rate of vaccinated and unvaccinated households only differed by two percent, and that four of the five most vaccinated countries were categorized by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as high transmission countries. In addition, he submitted a study conducted in Massachusetts in July 2021 demonstrating that, after attending public gatherings, 346 out of 469 COVID cases (74 percent) were among vaccinated persons. Presented with this data, the court concluded: It appears to be grossly negligent to ignore the vaccinated population as a possible and relevant source of transmission when deciding about public health control measures.4 The court admitted that vaccine mandates may have been found to be constitutional prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that do not appear to respond to COVID vaccines. However, now that vaccinated persons present nearly the same risk of transmission as unvaccinated persons, the court said that restrictions placed on the unvaccinated are not in proportion to the risk they pose to public health.4 The court wrote: While there is abundant data to show that getting vaccinated continues to be the dominant expert advice even in the face of new variants, no submission nor any data has been put forth to justify restrictions only on unvaccinated individuals when emerging scientific evidence appears to indicate that the risk of transmission of the virus from unvaccinated individuals is almost on par with that from vaccinated persons. To put it differently, neither the Union of India nor the State Governments have produced any material before this court to justify the discriminatory treatment of unvaccinated individuals in public places by imposition of vaccine mandates\u201d5 The court suggested that all authorities, public, private and educational, review their current orders that restrict an unvaccinated person\u2019s access to public services and resources. The Court: Government Followed Approval Process for COVID Vaccines Dr. Puliyel asserted that the government rushed the approval of COVID vaccines in, \u201ca hurried and opaque manner.\u201d6 He said that the trial data, regulatory approvals, and minutes from meetings approving the vaccine have not been publicly disclosed, which demonstrates a lack of transparency in the approval process, and that, while the complete data sets may not be available yet, releasing preliminary COVID vaccine adverse event data would allow individuals to make an informed vaccination decision. The court disagreed, finding that the government\u2019s approval for emergency use of the COVID-19 vaccines was properly made in accordance with the statutory regime in place. In India, all new drug trials must follow a certain protocol with stringent statutory requirements as set forth in the Good Clinical Practices guidelines and be approved by the Ethics Committee and the Central Licensing Authority. The Ethics Committee, which is comprised of medical, scientific and non-medical and nonscientific members, is an independent review board that is tasked with providing an objective and independent review of the clinical trials. The Union of India claimed that these strict clinical trial guidelines were followed for COVID vaccine clinical trials and that the main findings of trials have been published in a peer reviewed journal, in accordance with WHO requirements. The Court: Ongoing COVID Vaccine Trial Data Must Be Publicly Available The court agreed with the government and declined to mandate the disclosure of segregated clinical trial data, citing privacy reasons, and also declined to declare that COVID vaccine approvals were granted without proper review of clinical trial data. However, the court ordered that relevant data, which must be published under statutory regimes and WHO requirements for ongoing clinical trials, along with data from COVID vaccine post-marketing trials, be made available to the public without delay. Dr. Puliyel advised the court that, because clinical trials are made up of a small subset of the population, not all adverse events may be seen during trials and, instead, may only be noticed once the vaccine is available to the public at large. He pointed out that, in 2018, the WHO changed the way it classified adverse events after vaccination to only consider adverse events as vaccine related when that same adverse reaction also occurred during previous smaller, limited clinical trials. In other words: Reactions observed during post-marketing surveillance are not considered as \u2018consistent with causal association with vaccine\u2019, if a significant increase in such reactions during Phase III trials had not been recorded.7 In the case of the COVID vaccine trials, phase III trials were cut short and then control subjects were offered the vaccine, which had the effect of diluting the control group and ultimately making it impossible to evaluate potential differences in long term health outcomes between the vaccinated and control groups. At the same time, it makes it more possible for doctors to dismiss adverse events that occur post COVID vaccination, as adverse events are less likely to be considered vaccine related events. Therefore, Dr. Puliyel asked that all post marketing adverse event data be made available to the public. However, the court declined to act, finding that the Phase III trials were cut short on the advice of the SEC, and stating that the government has protocols in place to consider and investigate adverse reactions to COVID vaccine, which only occur during the post-marketing phase. Dr. Puliyel: India\u2019s Adverse Event Reporting System Should Be More Like VAERS Dr. Puliyel contended that the vaccine adverse events reporting system in India is not transparent and complete data as on serious adverse events should be published like in the United States though the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The court pointed out that the National AEFI Surveillance Secretariat, which has been in place for a decade, has a protocol in place for identifying and monitoring adverse events to vaccination. However, Dr. Puliyel argued that the vaccine adverse event reporting system in India needs to be changed to allow individuals, as well as private doctors, to report adverse events like is done in the U.S. with VAERS. The court agreed and directed the Union of India to facilitate the reporting of vaccine adverse events by individuals, as well as private doctors, on a public on-line platform. The court said: Information relating to adverse effects following immunisation is crucial for the purpose of understanding the safety of the vaccines that are being administered, apart from being instrumental in further scientific studies around the pandemic. There is an imminent need for collection of requisite data of adverse events and wider participation of people in reporting the adverse events is necessary for the purpose of gathering correct information.8 The Court: Pediatric COVID-19 Vaccination Program Will Stand Dr. Puliyel presented evidence that children are not at high risk of severe illness from COVID and argued that the risk from COVID vaccination outweighs the risk of getting seriously ill from the virus, pointing out that a large number of children in India have already recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The court sided with the government, stating that it would not second-guess expert opinion as to the safety of pediatric COVID vaccinations. However, the court ordered the Union of India to immediately release the key findings and clinical trial results of Corbevax, the COVID vaccine that does not use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which is being given to children, if that data has not already been released. The Supreme Court of India acknowledged that citizens have a liberty interest that prohibits forced vaccination; that restrictions placed on unvaccinated persons should be reviewed in light of the fact that the COVID vaccine does not prevent infection and transmission; that ongoing COVID vaccine clinical trial data should be publicly released, and that the government\u2019s vaccine adverse event reporting system should be improved. However, the court did not fully recognize and adequately respond to all of Dr. Puliyel\u2019s legitimate complaints about the government\u2019s COVID vaccination program.

        "link":"https:\/\/thevaccinereaction.org\/2022\/07\/canadians-may-have-to-get-covid-booster-shot-every-nine-months\/",
        "text":"On July 4, 2022, Canadian Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said Canadians may be required to get a COVID-19 booster shot every nine months to protect themselves against new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Duclos said, \u201cThe virus evolves and Omicron made us aware we will never be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. We have to maintain our vaccinations up to date.\u201d1 Currently in Canada, \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d is defined by Health Canada as having two doses of any of the public health agency\u2019s approved COVID vaccine.2 \u201cFully Vaccinated\u201d Makes No Sense Anymore Says Canadian Health Minister Minister Duclos\u2019 message may be directed to people who have not received their first booster.3 Government officials in Canada have said that, as of June 19, 2022, almost 81 percent of the total population has received the first two COVID shots but only 49 percent of the population has received a booster shot.4 Colin Furness, PhD, an epidemiologist from the University of Toronto and Nazeem Muhajarine, PhD, an epidemiologist from University of Saskatchewan, said that uptake for the third dose of a COVID shot has been slow in comparison to that of the first and second doses due to the fact that the vaccine was initially presented to the public as being comprised of two doses, giving people the idea that was all they needed to do to prevent having a serious case of COVID disease.5 Dr. Furness said: That\u2019s the mental model that most people had. So when we started to say you kind of need a third dose now \u2026 [they] said, \u2018You sold us an idea that there was a two-dose vaccine and I signed on, now you\u2019re changing the deal and I don\u2019t like that, I\u2019m walking away.\u20196 When asked if the COVID vaccine mandate would return in the fall of 2022, Minister Duclos responded: We must continue to fight against COVID. We want to be prepared for next fall, and that requires an up-to-date vaccination, which is based on the nine months.7 Minister Duclos also made it clear that no one is \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d anymore. He said: Nine months is very clear and will help people understand why \u2018up-to-date\u2019 is the right way to think about vaccination now. Fully vaccinated\u2019 makes no sense now. It\u2019s about \u2018up-to-date.\u2019 So am I up-to-date in my vaccination? Have I received a vaccination in the last nine months?\u201d He added that, \u201cUp-to-date\u2019 means you have received your last dose in the past nine months. If you\u2019ve already received a first booster, that\u2019s great. Please see if you\u2019re eligible for a second or third booster to remain up-to-date.8 Majority of Canadians Willing to Get a COVID Booster According to the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) conducted in the fall of 2021, 86 percent of Canadians aged 12 and older reported that they were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat likely\u201d to get a COVID booster shot.9 The survey showed differences across different populations with respect to willingness to receive a COVID booster dose. From September to mid-November 2021, women were slightly more likely than men to report being willing to get a booster dose (87 percent versus 85 percent). Among youth aged 12 to 17.84 percent reported a willingness to get a booster, which was similar to adults aged 18 to 49 (83 percent). Older Canadians aged 50 and older reported higher booster dose willingness (89 percent) compared with the younger age groups.10 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

        "link":"https:\/\/thevaccinereaction.org\/2021\/08\/texas-gov-abbott-joins-growing-club-of-coronavirus-breakthrough-cases\/",
        "text":"Opinion | It is interesting to observe the mainstream media\u2019s reporting of the recent news that Governor Greg Abbott of Texas has tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. For example, the headline of an article by CNBC reads, \u201cTexas Gov. Abbott, who banned mask and vaccine mandates, tests positive for Covid.\u201d Another headline by Yahoo! News reads, \u201cTexas Gov. Greg Abbott, who opposes vaccine and mask mandates, tests positive for COVID-19.\u201d Another one by The Guardian reads, \u201cTexas governor Greg Abbott, who fought mask mandates, tests positive for Covid.\u201d1 2 3 A CNN headline reads, \u201cGov. Abbott tests positive for Covid-19 after months of blocking mask mandates.\u201d One more\u2014this one by BuzzFeed News: \u201cTexas Gov. Greg Abbott Tested Positive For COVID-19, As He Fights Mask Mandates.\u201d4 5 There appears to be an orchestrated effort by the mainstream media of trying to convey a subtle message of poetic justice that goes something like this: \u201cThat\u2019ll teach Abbott for being such an obstructionist on mask mandates in his state. Serves him right.\u201d It is a message that is consistent with a disturbing and growing tendency by some Americans to shame and vilify fellow Americans who do not share their enthusiasm for every government COVID-related mandate that comes along. Media Tries to Tie Abbott\u2019s Coronavirus Infection to His Stance on Mask Mandates All of these articles are supposed to be news articles, but from the start they already betray a clear political bias. Gov. Abbott and Gov. Rick DeSantis of Florida have been taking a lot of heat lately from government officials and the media for prohibiting cities and school boards in their states from passing mask mandates for children attending schools. Both Abbott and DeSantis believe that parents should decide whether or not their children wear masks in schools.6 7 8 In a statement on July 29, 2021 about the Executive Order he signed on May 18 prohibiting government entities in Texas from mandating masks,9 Gov. Abbott said: [Parents] have the individual right and responsibility to decide for themselves and their children whether they will wear masks, open their businesses, and engage in leisure activities. Vaccines, which remain in abundant supply, are the most effective defense against the virus, and they will always remain voluntary\u2014never forced\u2014in the State of Texas7 In other words, Gov. Abbott\u2019s order doesn\u2019t prohibit children from wearing masks in schools, it simply prohibits Texas state authorities from forcing them to do so. On Aug. 15, the Texas Supreme Court upheld Gov. Abbott\u2019s mask mandate prohibition by granting a request for a \u201ctemporary, emergency stay\u201d of an appellate court ruling that would have allowed schools in Dallas and Bexar counties to require masks. In another case involving Travis county, the Texas Supreme Court on Aug. 19 denied Gov. Abbott\u2019s request to \u201cblock temporary restraining orders\u201d on his mask mandate prohibition. That decision effectively allows schools that require students to wear masks, in defiance of Gov. Abbott\u2019s mask mandate prohibition, to proceed.10 On Aug. 3, President Joe Biden called out Gov. Abbott, Gov. DeSantis and other governors for \u201cpassing laws or signing orders that forbid people from doing the right thing.\u201d Biden noted, \u201cAs of now, seven states not only banned mask mandates, but also banned them in their school districts, even for young children who cannot get vaccinated.\u201d7 He added: Look, we need leadership from everyone. If some governors are not willing to do the right thing, then they should allow businesses and universities who want to do the right thing, to be able to do it. I say to these governors, please help. If you\u2019re not going to help, at least get out of the way of the people trying to do the right thing. Use your power to save lives.6 7 11 More recently, U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona admonished Gov. Abbott and Gov. DeSantis for their executive orders on mask mandates. In a letter to Gov. Abbott, Secretary Cardona wrote that his order \u201cmay infringe upon a school district\u2019s authority to adopt policies to protect students and educators as they develop their safe return to in-person instruction plans required by federal law.\u201d12 Cardona added: The Department [of Education] stands with these dedicated educators who are working to safely reopen schools and maintain safe in-person instruction.12 Abbott Received Three COVID Shots and Still Got Coronavirus The bias that is evident in some of the media coverage about Gov. Abbott\u2019s positive test for coronavirus seems aimed at pressuring Abbott to see the error of his ways by seeking to remind him how contagious is the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the need for requiring people to abide by the federal government\u2019s masking recommendations. But perhaps the media bias is also meant to distract from a more noteworthy detail of this story, which is that Gov. Abbott is fully vaccinated. Gov. Abbott received the first dose of Pfizer\/BioNTech\u2019s experimental messenger RNA (mRNA) biologic (known as BNT162b2 or Comirnaty vaccine) on Dec. 22, 2020 and likely received the second dose in January 2021. He reportedly received a third shot\u2014a booster dose\u2014as well. \u201cGovernor Abbott is fully vaccinated against COVID-19, in good health, and currently experiencing no symptoms,\u201d said Mark Miner, the governor\u2019s communications director.13 14 15 16 17 So even with three Comirnaty shots in less than one year, Gov. Abbott still tested positive for coronavirus? That would seem to be the most relevant and concerning point on which to focus. Not his stand on mask mandates. Gov. Abbott can now be added to the growing club of so-called \u201cbreakthrough cases\u201d of Americans who contracted coronavirus despite being fully vaccinated. The latest rough estimate of the number breakthrough cases in the United States is 193,204, as reported recently by The Wall Street Journal.18 That figure, however, is based on data provided by only by 44 state health departments and a lack of understanding of how many vaccinated Americans have been asymptomatically infected, so you can bet that the estimate is woefully low.18 19 20 21 It is worth noting that there are some media sources that have at least made an effort to highlight the relevance of Gov. Abbott\u2019s vaccination status. NBC affiliate WAVY-TV in Portsmouth, Virginia reported, \u201cGov. Greg Abbott tests positive for COVID despite being fully vaccinated.\u201d Similar examples, though, are rare If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

        "title":"A Gratitude Script for the COVID Vaccinated But Infected",
        "link":"https:\/\/thevaccinereaction.org\/2022\/08\/a-gratitude-script-for-the-covid-vaccinated-but-infected\/",
        "text":"\u201cI would like to let you know that I have tested positive for #COVID19. I am thankful to have received four doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and I am feeling well while experiencing very mild symptoms. I am isolating and have started a course of Paxlovid.\u201d These were the words of Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla on Aug. 15, 2022 shortly after discovering he had tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and developed symptoms of COVID-19.1 2 \u201cI guess you heard, this morning I tested positive for COVID. But I\u2019ve been double vaccinated, double boosted. Symptoms are mild and I really appreciate your inquires and concerns. But I\u2019m doing well, getting a lot of work done. Going to continue to get it done and in the meantime, thanks for your concern and keep the faith. It\u2019s gonna be OK.\u201d These were President Biden\u2019s words on July 21, 2022 soon after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and showing COVID symptoms.3 President Biden was prescribed Pfizer\u2019s antiviral therapy Paxlovid, which is advertised as reducing the risk of hospitalization and death. After completion of the five-day regimen of Paxlovid, he tested positive again for SARS-CoV-2 several times and experienced a recurrence of COVID symptoms\u2014a phenomenon known as \u201cCOVID-19 rebound\u201d (or \u201cPaxlovid rebound\u201d).4 5 6 On June 15, 2022, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued a news release stating that Anthony Fauci, MD, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and chief medical advisor to President Biden, had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and developed symptoms of COVID.7 According to the release: He is fully vaccinated and has been boosted twice. He is currently experiencing mild symptoms. Dr. Fauci will isolate and continue to work from his home.7 Dr. Fauci went on to take Paxlovid. He experienced COVID-19 rebound and subsequently took a second round of Paxlovid before eventually testing negative for SARS-CoV-2.8 A lot of people still do not know that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only required the vaccine manufacturers to demonstrate that COVID shots were at least 50 percent effective in preventing severe symptoms of disease, hospitalization and death, rather than preventing infection and transmission, which has always been the purpose of vaccination.9 Stoking the public\u2019s belief that getting a COVID shot would protect against getting infected with SARS-CoV-2, President Biden confidently stated during a July 2021 CNN town hall meeting that, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.\u201d10 The Irony of Getting Four Shots and Still Getting COVID It is ironic that all three of these high-profile, influential players in the COVID saga\u2014Bourla, Biden and Fauci, who have consistently been promoting COVID vaccinations and have each gotten four shots\u2014have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and come down with COVID. But what is perhaps most interesting is how each of them has gone out their way to put a positive spin on their common experience. Rather than express a sense of frustration that, despite all those shots, they still managed to get infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and develop COVID, all three of these individuals actually emphasized the fact that they were fully vaccinated and boosted and doing well, implying that their wellness was directly due to all those shots. \u201cMild symptoms\u201d being the operative phrase. But how do they know the mildness of their symptoms was attributable to the shots they got? After all, there are vaccinated people who have suffered from severe COVID symptoms and been hospitalized, and even died. And there have been unvaccinated people who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 but never developed any COVID symptoms or only mild ones. In the case of Bourla, the symptoms were \u201cvery mild.\u201d In the case of President Biden, the symptoms were so mild that he was \u201cgetting a lot of work done.\u201d No need to stay in bed and rest. The symptoms for Dr. Fauci were also so mild and the spin was that he would \u201ccontinue to work from his home.\u201d No need to do what sick people normally do and take it easy. Taking Paxlovid to Prevent Serious COVID Illness? It\u2019s also interesting to note that all three of these individuals opted to take Paxlovid. Twice, in Dr. Fauci\u2019s case. But why? Isn\u2019t the primary selling point of the COVID shots that they protect against serious COVID illness, hospitalization and death? Some might say that prescribing Paxlovid indicated a lack of confidence in the shots. Others might argue that the antiviral drug simply provides an added measure of insurance against a really bad outcome from the \u201cbreakthrough\u201d infection. Others might just call it overkill, an act of desperation. The Thankfulness Refrain from the COVID Vaxxed While there are similarities in the statements by Bourla, Biden and Fauci confirming their coronavirus infections and COVID conditions, they pale in comparison to the statements of other well-known Americans who were fully vaccinated and boosted for COVID. For example, here\u2019s the statement from former President Barack Obama: I just tested positive for COVID. I\u2019ve had a scratchy throat for a couple days, but am feeling fine otherwise. Michelle and I are grateful to be vaccinated and boosted, and she has tested negative. It\u2019s a reminder to get vaccinated if you haven\u2019t already, even as cases go down.11 The following is the statement from U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts: I regularly test for COVID & while I tested negative earlier this week, today I tested positive with a breakthrough case. Thankfully, I am only experiencing mild symptoms & am grateful for the protection provided against serious illness that comes from being vaccinated & boosted.12 Here\u2019s the statement from former First Lady and former U.S. Senator from New York Hillary Clinton: Well, I\u2019ve tested positive for COVID. I\u2019ve got some mild cold symptoms but am feeling fine. I\u2019m more grateful than ever for the protection vaccines can provide against serious illness. Please get vaccinated and boosted if you haven\u2019t already!13 The statement from U.S. Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia reads: Late this afternoon after a routine test, I tested positive for COVID-19. I\u2019m so thankful to be both vaccinated & boosted, and at the advice of the Attending Physician I plan to isolate. If you haven\u2019t gotten your shot yet, I encourage you to do so.14 I could go on and on. There is no scarcity of nearly identical remarks from members of Congress, members of President Biden\u2019s Cabinet, foreign government officials, TV celebrities and professional athletes. But for the sake of not beating a dead horse\u2026 just one more. This one from U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut: Unfortunately, I\u2019ve tested positive for COVID. So this week, I\u2019ll be working remotely. I\u2019m not experiencing symptoms & am thankful to be fully vaccinated & boosted. If you haven\u2019t gotten your shot or booster yet, make an appointment today!15 The commonality is striking. It\u2019s almost as if they were auditioning for a role in a Broadway show and reading from the same script. Despite being fully vaccinated, fully boosted and fully infected, they were all doing fine and thankful to have gotten the shots. All but one of them felt the need to market COVID products. A mere coincidence? Perhaps. Or maybe there is a script. If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

        "text":"As the debate continues surrounding the issue of bodily autonomy being violated by school and workplace COVID-19 vaccine mandates, a new research study that analyzed more than one million people has found that natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2 offers longer lasting protection than vaccination.1 The study, which was published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), found that vaccine-induced artificial immunity waned rapidly, whereas individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infections were moderately protected from the Omicron strain with little decline in protection even a year after infection.2 The case-control analysis found that a combination of full vaccination and prior infection was maximally protective. However, the study found that three doses of Pfizer\u2019s Comirnaty or Moderna\u2019s Spikevax messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID biologics offered no significant protection against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 variant, Omicron.2 FDA to Use Mice Instead of Humans to Approve Boosters The NEJM study was released in June 2022 Meanwhile, media outlets are reporting that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to grant Pfizer and Moderna an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to distribute their Omicron booster shots the week of Labor Day, which reportedly offers protection against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.3 The FDA is utilizing a controversial strategy to evaluate the boosters, relying on old testing data using mice instead of data from human clinical trials for the first time.4 Pfizer\u2019s new COVID booster shot is being approved under an EUA for those aged 12 years and older, while Moderna\u2019s shot is approved for adults. Weill Cornell Medicine immunologist John Moore, PhD stated: For the FDA to rely on mouse data is just bizarre, in my opinion. Mouse data are not going to be predictive in any way of what you would see in humans.4 Others argue that the U.S. has had enough experience with the safety and efficacy of the COVID vaccines in humans and that \u201cthere\u2019s not enough time to wait for data from human studies.\u201d4 Other Studies Demonstrate Natural Immunity is More Robust More than a dozen additional studies have demonstrated the power of the human immune system, finding that natural immunity offered greater protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.1 Perhaps the most well-known of these was a study out of Israel published in 2021, which examined the medical records of tens of thousands of Israelis and found o that individuals with prior infection were less likely to get the Delta variant and more thoroughly protected.5 Israel is one of the most highly vaccinated countries in the world. Upon publication of the NEJM study, U.S. Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky tweeted: Among the most fraudulent messages of the CDC\u2019s campaign of deceit is to force the vaccine on those with prior infection, who have a greater degree of protection against all versions of the virus than those with any of the vaccines.1 COVID Boosters Developed by Guessing the Upcoming Strain Scientists believe that the future of COVID vaccine development may be similar to influenza vaccines, which are changed yearly in a best-guess attempt by public health officials to match the seasonal influenza vaccine to strains that are likely to be circulating.6 It was once believed that flu vaccine efficacy was 70-90 percent. However, those studies were later found to only have measured the initial antibody spike after vaccination, which did not always confer long lasting artificial immunity. More accurate flu vaccine efficacy numbers range anywhere from 10 to 60 percent, depending on the year.7 In an article describing why flu vaccines are \u201clackluster\u201d and so often fail, the journal Science writes: They\u2019re learning instead that the vaccine may falter even when the right strains were used to make it, perhaps because of how it is produced or quirks of individual immune systems. It\u2019s much more complicated than we thought.7 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

        "title":"Journal Article Questioning COVID Vaccination Protocols Retracted",
        "link":"https:\/\/thevaccinereaction.org\/2021\/07\/journal-article-questioning-covid-vaccination-protocols-retracted\/",
        "text":"A scholarly article published in a medical journal, in which authors concluded that a \u201clack of clear benefit should cause governments to rethink their vaccination policy,\u201d has been retracted less than two weeks after publication. The article entitled \u201cThe Safety of COVID-19 Vaccinations\u2014We Should Rethink the Policy\u201d was published by MDPI (Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute) on June 24, 2021 and analyzed the information from international databases. The article was retracted on July 2.1 The article\u2019s authors used a large Israeli field study that included approximately one million people to calculate the number of individuals needed to vaccinate in order to prevent one infection and death caused by COVID-19. They then extracted numbers of side effects reported to the Dutch National Register for the Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines to calculate risk. Their findings indicated that \u201cfor three deaths prevented by vaccination, we have to accept two inflicted by vaccination\u2026 thus placing risks and benefits on the same order of magnitude.\u201d1 Underplaying Adverse Reactions by National Authorities and Media Outlets The article\u2019s authors suggested that \u201cperhaps it might be necessary to dampen the enthusiasm with sober facts,\u201d1 stating the need for independent science case reviews of severe reactions, reconsideration of national policies, and evidence-based recommendations for vaccination on an individual case-by-case basis. This stance is echoed in a recent Wall Street Journal opinion article, which criticizes the lack of media representation about the potential risks of the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as the politicization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the vaccine. The authors state that public health authorities are risking the public\u2019s trust by not being forthcoming about potential harms from the vaccine, and that \u201cthe battle to recover scientific honesty will be an uphill one in the U.S.\u201d2 Researchers Resign Following Widespread Criticism and Article Retraction The website Gizmodo was quick to publish an article entitled \u201cJournal Retracts Terrible Study that Claimed Widespread Covid-19 Vaccine Deaths\u201d two days following retraction of the journal article.3 The Gizmodo author states that the article was condemned as flawed and irresponsible by other scientists and that the well-respected researchers have since resigned from association with the journal. Following criticism, the journal article was retracted after the journal\u2019s editors said they found \u201cseveral errors that fundamentally affect the interpretation of the findings.\u201d3 Mainstream Media Alleges VAERS is Source of \u201cMisinformation\u201d Gizmodo reports that adverse reporting systems such as the one used by the researchers who published the retracted article are designed to report any health problem or death after using a new drug or vaccine, but that the reports don\u2019t necessarily indicate the drug or vaccine caused the health problem or death. The Gizmodo article author states: But caution should be warranted if someone starts making extraordinary claims about safety or lack thereof\u2014especially if those claims are based on adverse event reporting systems.3 Vaccine adverse event reporting systems, which many people did not know existed prior to the dissemination of experimental COVID-19 vaccines under an emergency use authorization (EUA) granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2020,4 increasingly have been criticized by the media as the numbers of serious health problem have been reported following COVID-19 vaccinations. Despite being credited for identifying the blood clots associated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine5 and myocarditis associated with the mRNA vaccines,6 many news outlets report that the U.S. based system VAERS (the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) is a tool used by those opposed to mandatory use of COVID-19 vaccine to emphasize vaccine risks and that the system is \u201cripe for abuse, misuse, and plain misunderstanding.\u201d5 The CDC\u2019s website describing VAERS clearly identifies limitations of using VAERS data to make conclusions about causal relationships between an adverse event report filed in VAERS and the vaccination(s) received. However, CDC officials also urge vaccine providers and recipients to report adverse events following vaccination to VAERS as required under the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act.7 There have been more adverse events, including deaths, reported to VAERS following COVID-19 vaccinations than for any other vaccine.8 Most mainstream media outlets promoting the use of COVID-19 vaccine are critical of VAERS and minimize the significance of adverse event reports filed in VAERS. As ABC News states: \u201cAlthough VAERS contains millions of reports of injuries following vaccinations, the vast majority of those injuries are coincidental.\u201d5 If you would like to receive an e-mail notice of the most recent articles published in The Vaccine Reaction each week, click here.

But, as Ruchir Sharma recently warned, \"don't be fooled\" by the recent dollar strength. The currency may look strong but its weaknesses are mounting... Today, as in the dotcom era, the dollar appears to be benefiting from its safe-haven status, with most of the world\u2019s markets selling off. But investors are not rushing to buy US assets. They are reducing their risk everywhere and holding the resulting cash in dollars. This is not a vote of confidence in the US economy, and it is worth recalling that bullish analysts offered the same reason for buying tech stocks at their recent peak valuations: there is no alternative. That ended badly. Tina is never a viable investment strategy, especially not when the fundamentals are deteriorating. So don\u2019t be fooled by the strong dollar. The post-dollar world is coming.

The NYPD is searching for two teenagers suspected of hate crimes after they attacked two Orthodox Jews in Williamsburg this past Saturday night. In one incident, a perp can be seen spraying a fire extinguisher at an elderly man on his way to pray.https:\/\/t.co\/V7DwyMiyfi pic.twitter.com\/u3PftYAxxE \u2014 Moshe Schwartz (@YWNReporter) August 21, 2022 The arrests come amid reports of increased attacks targeting Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn. New York City Police Commissioner Keechant L. Sewell identified Carrington Maddox, a 31-year-old black man from East Williamsburg, as suspected of slapping a 27-year-old Hasidic Jewish man in the face on a Brooklyn street last Monday. Maddox was charged with aggravated harassment and menacing as a hate crime. Police also arrested a juvenile for two separate incidents that took place before and after that attack. On August 21, two Jewish men were sprayed with a fire extinguisher while walking to morning prayers in separate incidents minutes apart. One of the victims was 72, and the other was 64. A 14-year-old black youth was charged with the assault as a hate crime, assault, and aggravated harassment. On Thursday, the NYPD\u2019s hate crimes unit said it had arrested three juveniles from Staten Island for grand larceny after they allegedly snatched the yarmulke off the head of a 13-year-old. \u203c\ufe0fWANTED- Grand Larceny\u203c\ufe0f These individuals are wanted for a Grand Larceny where a Kippah was taken off the head of a 13-year-old Jewish boy in front of CVS at 2690 Hylan Boulevard.

Earlier this month, the word \u201cHitler\u201d was painted on the wall of a Brooklyn synagogue used by Holocaust survivors, and antisemitic leaflets were distributed in residential areas of Long Island. On July 13, 31-year-old Yossi Hershkop was in his idling car at a Brooklyn intersection while his 5-year-old child sat in the back seat when he was attacked by four young men. Two of the men punched him through the open window. The attack was recorded on a security camera which also recorded the license plate of the attackers\u2019 car. No arrests were made during the two weeks after the attack. After Hershkop publicized the event on social media, an arrest was made, but the suspect was released on a bond of $10,000. Hershkop identified all of the assailants as young black men. Police said they were stepping up patrols around synagogues and other sensitive sites, increasing coordination with community safety groups, and preparing for the upcoming High Holiday season. \u201cIn the wake of these senseless attacks, we deployed round-the-clock house of worship cars to visit synagogues routinely,\u201d NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell said in a press conference on Monday evening. \u201cWe increased patrols to visit sensitive locations.\u201d Hate crime arrests rose by 103% this year across New York City, with most of the increase being accounted for by an increased attacks on Jews. Attacks on Jewish New Yorkers up by 43% compared to last year, Inspector Andy Arias of the Hate Crimes Division said last week. In February, a 409% rise in anti-Jewish hate crimes over the same period last year. The NYPD has confirmed 149 anti-Jewish hate crimes between the start of the year and June 28, representing an incident every 29 hours on average. But it should be noted that in a study released this past July, the New York-based group Americans Against Antisemitism found that of the 118 adults arrested for anti-Jewish hate crimes in New York City since 2018, only one has been convicted and sent to prison.",

        "text":"The ongoing so-called \u2018pandemic\u2019 has hit everyone hard, no one has escaped the grip of the tyrannical reaction from Governments around the World, but there is a group of the population which is suffering in silence, in plain view, this group are the future of human society and parents are unknowingly through their own ignorance, destroying them both physically and mentally. Let\u2019s talk about the Children. Another Brick in The Wall Witnessing children going to school was a shocking sight to behold, as the bused loaded with fully masked children parked up outside the school gates, children were ushered off the bus by a team of teachers who ensured social distancing was achieved as the children made their way to their new pandemic modified classrooms. With all over 12-year-olds now expected to wear Face Masks throughout the day, social distancing maintained where possible and the constant reminder of the big bad scary COVID-19 lurking around every corner; School is quite the little house of horrors. But it doesn\u2019t end there. Parents are shamefully allowing their children, and likely encouraging them either directly or indirectly to wear face masks out in public, when shopping or at the park. Virtue Signalling While shopping the other day at my local supermarket, I witnessed multiple parents with children as young as 5 fully masked, in one case they had matching pink face masks. Ugggh! Using your children as part of your ridiculous virtue signalling games is disgusting. Under any other circumstances, this unquestionably would be considered as \u2018Child Abuse\u2019. Covering a child\u2019s airways and thus restricting airflow to the child\u2019s lungs is clearly an issue. Where are those lovely child-snatchers over at social services now? But the physical abuse is just a very small part of the problem. It is the ongoing psychological abuse on children that really is at a scale never witnessed before. Fear is the Mind Killer For over a year, children have been placed in a perpetual state of fear, the fear of the killer bug, the fear for their own lives, but even more so, the fear of killing those they love \u2013 their parents, their grandparents. \u201cStay Safe!\u201d. When people I deal with say this to me in closing our conversation I want to scream. It\u2019s everywhere, from billboards to motorway information displays. Everywhere I go, \u201cStay Safe\u201d, \u201cStay Safe!\u201d, \u201cStay Safe!\u201d. Please enough, if it makes me feel like I\u2019m loosing my sanity, god only knows how young children are feeling right now. Filthy Little Rats! We live in unprecedented times, a time where social division is promoted and human contact is condemned. For the first time in history, a child is now made to feel guilty for cuddling up to their parents, a time when a hug is needed more than ever. Britons should not hug their children even once they\u2019ve been vaccinated, an expert has stressed \u2013 The Evening Standard[1] And keep away from your much loved Grandparents, don\u2019t touch them \u2013 you might kill them: Grandparents who have received the Covid vaccine should not yet hug their families, a professor has warned, amid fears that those who have had the jab will abandon the lockdown rules. \u2013 The Telegraph[2] \u201cKeep those filthy little child hands to yourself, you are a potentially deadly weapon and you wouldn\u2019t want to kill your own loved ones, would you? Stay Safe!\u201d Mental Abuse I cannot begin to imagine how all this feels for children right now, but new data is emerging and it doesn\u2019t look pretty. Dr. Richard Delorme heads the psychiatric department at one of the largest children\u2019s hospitals in France and what he is seeing is devastating: \u201cWe are very surprised by the intensity of the desire to die among children who may be 12 or 13 years old,\u201d Delorme said. \u201cWe sometimes have children of 9 who already want to die. And it\u2019s not simply aprovocation or a blackmail via suicide. It is a genuine wish to end their lives.\u201d \u2013AP News[3] Depression in children grew exponentially just through the UK\u2019s first lockdown: \u201cTo give an indication of how large this effect is, imagine ranking the children into 100 \u2018centiles\u2019 depending on their scores,\u201d explained Dr Duncan Astle from the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit and senior author of the study. \u201cA child in the 50th centile would be exactly at the middle of the distribution. But a child at this position before the pandemic, could expect to be at the equivalent of the 77th centile during the lockdown. \u201cPut differently, if you randomly selected a child from the sample there is a 70% chance that their depression symptoms were worse during lockdown than before the pandemic.\u201d \u2013 University of Cambridge[4] That was the observation of children just after a few months of the pandemic. What are the effects a year on? Ignorance is Bliss In many cases parents play a large part of this abuse, by participating in this pandemic fiasco, reinforcing the lies and fears presented by the Government and media, they are validating fear and confusion in their children. It\u2019s disgusting and unforgiveable. There is no excuse for lack of research and critical thinking, particularly when this neglect to one\u2019s own knowledge results in the abuse of your own children. Parents who pander to these false fears in front of their children should be shamed, they should be held accountable. Not by Government, they\u2019ve done quite enough damage, but by society. Good is Bad; Black is White But in this topsy-turvy World it is I that is shamed; shamed for taking my children out shopping; shamed for failing to sanitize my children\u2019s hands and my own at every entry and exit point; failure to wear a mask or prevent my children from running around like lunatics as if there was nothing to fear. We are the lepers, the freaks, the odd ones out. We who have ensured our children remain free, happy and emotionally satisfied both mentally and physically. We are the parents of concern, simply for loving our children first and foremost. Take this piece from the teen propaganda publication Teen Vogue entitled \u2018Young People on Holiday Risks With Parents Who Ignore COVID-19 Restrictions'[5] for example: Selena\u2019s mom hasn\u2019t tempered her activities because of COVID-19restrictions \u2014 she\u2019s still going on out-of-town trips and gambling in casinos. Selena\u2019s aunt, a nurse, doesn\u2019t wear her mask dependably. She says her mother\u2019s side of the family doesn\u2019t know anyone who has gotten sick or died from COVID, so it\u2019s easy for them to pretend it isn\u2019t real. Plus, she says, they don\u2019t listen to reliable news sources \u2014 \u201csome of them still claim that the election was a fraud, so it\u2019s one of those situations.\u201d \u2013 Teen Vogue[5] This shameful piece of propaganda continues to vilify the parents while validating and indeed amplifying children\u2019s fears using unconfirmed science: But there are now reports of people contracting the virus twice, suggesting immunity may not last. Teen Vogue[5] It is true that there are cases of people contracting the virus twice, but we are talking about a small handful of cases from the millions that have contracted the virus. The article intentionally fails to elaborate on this topic, they simply make the statement that you can catch it twice, and leave it there. This article is just one of thousands designed to turn children against their parents. Its psychological warfare against your children, you and the family unit as a whole. Please, I urge you, no matter what your views on the pandemic are, please put your children first, second and third. There is nothing more important in this world than our children, they are our future, our legacy. Please leave your comments below.",

        "text":"(Natural News) A study performed in Taiwan found that two kinds of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulations significantly reduced disease progression in patients infected with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). The study, whose findings are set to be published in Pharmacological Research in October 2022, was a joint effort by multiple researchers from different Taiwanese institutions. It ran from May 1, 2021 to July 26, 2021 and involved 548 patients. The study participants were given the TCM formulations NRICM101 and NRICM102, which were both developed by the Taiwanese National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine. NRICM101 was formulated in 2020 and became the first TCM treatment to be legally sold in more than 50 countries as a COVID-19 treatment. Ten herbs comprise NRICM101, namely: Scutellaria root Heartleaf houttuynia (Houttuynia cordata) Mongolian snakegourd (Trichosanthes kirilowii) fruit Indigowoad (Isatis tinctoria) root Magnolia (Magnolia officinalis) bark Peppermint (Mentha \u00d7 piperita) Fine leaf Nepeta Mulberry (Morus) leaf Saposhnikovia divaricata root Baked liquorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) root NRICM102 was later formulated based on the earlier NRICM101, with the former\u2019s additional ingredients supporting the respiratory and immune systems. According to the Taiwanese institute, NRICM102\u2019s revised formulation specifically focuses on patients severely ill with COVID-19. The October 2022 study found that COVID-19 patients treated with both NRICM101 and NRICM102 \u201cwere at significantly less risk of [intensive care unit] admission or death, compared to those who were not treated with the herbal formulas.\u201d The researchers chose 246 patients without hypoxia (low oxygen levels in the blood) and 302 patients with normal blood oxygen levels. They then divided both into two groups, and observed them for a period of 30 days. Half of the patients with normal blood oxygen levels received NRICM101, while the remaining 151 received normal care only. Meanwhile, 123 patients with hypoxia were given the NRICM102 formulation while the other half did not. In the normal blood oxygen level group, none of the patients given the TCM formulation progressed to severe COVID-19. Meanwhile, 14 patients from the group who did not receive NRICM101 saw their COVID-19 infections worsen. A similar observation was noted in the hypoxia group. Following the observation period, the use of the later NRICM102 was associated with a 74 percent reduction in the relative risk of death. (Related: Medicinal herbs effectively treat thousands of covid-19 patients in Chinese hospitals.) Herbal medicine can be used as preventative treatment for high-risk individuals According to NRICM Deputy Director Chiou Wen-Fei, two herbs used in the NRICM101 formulation play a key role in addressing COVID-19 infections. She explained that H. cordata and Scutellaria root serve to eliminate SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen responsible for COVID-19. Chiou emphasized, however, that these two herbs taken by themselves alone are not as effective as the multi-herb formula. Back in August 2021, the institute issued several clarifications regarding the use of NRICM101. According to the NRICM, the herbal medicine can be used as a preventative treatment for high-risk individuals. It explained: \u201cDue to COVID-19\u2019s highly infectious nature, proactive prevention in high-risk individuals is recommended. NRICM101 can be prescribed both as a treatment for patients with COVID-19 \u2013 asymptomatic, mild or severe \u2013 and as prevention for high-risk individuals from infection or to reduce symptoms if infected.\u201d The institute also stated that NRICM101 \u201cshould not be consumed by healthy individuals or those who are at low risk of COVID-19 infection.\u201d It warned of \u201cminor side effects \u2013 such as indigestion, diarrhea and fatigue \u2013 in children with [a] weaker body constitution, [the] elderly and those with sensitive digestive tracts.\u201d NRICM Director Dr. Su Yi-Chang lauded TCM during the 14th Taipei Traditional Chinese Medicine International Forum. According to him, TCM differs from its Western counterpart for two reasons. First, its formulations are designed to be multi-targeted compared to Western drugs that target one symptom at a time. Second, Chinese medicine uses lower dosages \u2013 resulting in fewer side effects and a smaller chance of drug resistance. Watch this video explaining the three concepts of \u201cjing,\u201d \u201cqi,\u201d and \u201cshen\u201d that play a huge role in TCM. This video is from the NinjaAlex420 channel on Brighteon.com.

        "text":"(Natural News) Efforts to stop New York City politicians from forcing city employees to get \u201cvaccinated\u201d for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) are seeing another setback after Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a Barack Hussein Obama appointee, turned down a request by New York Police Department (NYPD) detective Anthony Marciano to reinstate a temporary restraining order against the mandate. The order was issued in late 2021 by a New York judge, only to later be dissolved by a federal court. An appeals court also rejected a request for a stay pending appeal, which ultimately led to Sotomayor receiving Marciano\u2019s request. (Related: Kathy Hochul dropped the mandate for MTA workers after hordes of them quit in protest.) A lawyer for Marciano stated that the mandate is causing his client irreparable harm as his due process rights are being infringed. The covid jab mandate is also a violation of both state and federal law, the lawyer argued. \u201cA majority of this Court would likely agree the Mayor of the City of New York has no executive authority that permits him to mandate an EUA Covid 19 vaccination, that is prohibited under existing NYS and federal laws from being imposed on any adult in NYC, employee or otherwise,\u201d the brief reads. \u201cNonetheless, the challenged adult-vaccination-mandate requires all NYC municipal workers receive an EUA Covid 19 vaccination, with or without requisite informed consent, and \/ or with or without a Judicial Order of Quarantine PHL \u00a72120 (3), required by state and federal law, or be fired.\u201d In her rejection of Marciano\u2019s request, Sotomayor did not provide any explanation as to her decision. It simply went to her because she happens to be in charge of the United States Court of Appeals 2nd Circuit, which includes the state of New York. Marciano, who has worked for the NYPD for more than 10 years, had applied for a religious exemption to the citywide mandate, only to have it turned down by his superiors. He is still employed by the department. Forcing people to get jabbed for covid aligns with NYC\u2019s charter, courts decide In 2021, New York Supreme Court Judge Frank Nervo entered the temporary block, only to soon after dismiss Marciano\u2019s suit. Nervo decided that NYC health officials have the authority to impose jab mandates. Marciano\u2019s next step was to take the matter to federal court, which ended up being presided over by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, a Bill Clinton appointee. Like Nervo, Rakoff ruled that NYC authorities have the authority to issue jab mandates, citing the decision in Garcia v. New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene. This court found that NYC\u2019s charter \u201cempowers the Department with \u2018jurisdiction to regulate all matters affecting health in the city of New York and to perform all those functions and operations performed by the city that relate to the health of the people of the city,\u2019 including in matter relating to the \u2018control of communicable and chronic disease and conditions hazardous to life and health.'\u201d \u201cA very direct connection\u201d was also found between flu shot requirements and the city\u2019s new covid jab requirements, both of which aim for \u201cthe preservation of health and safety,\u201d according to the courts. \u201cThe same can be said about Board\u2019s requirement that City employees and contractors be vaccinated against COVID-19,\u201d Rakoff declared. The Second Circuit later denied a request for a stay pending appeal, deciding that Marciano had failed to meet the standards for a stay. The appeals court is still overseeing Marciano\u2019s case, and it could end up ruling in his favor.

        "link":"https:\/\/www.naturalnews.com\/2022-09-01-nature-study-triple-vaccinated-clots-long-covid.html",
        "text":"(Natural News) The Nature journal published a new feature highlighting an epidemic of \u201clong covid\u201d that is afflicting the triple-vaccinated. People like Lara Hawthorne, a British illustrator who took three shots and \u201cfelt quite protected,\u201d are now suffering strange illnesses linked to clots caused by the injections. Hawthorne told Nature that she has been sick for months now with a variety of \u201coften debilitating symptoms\u201d including constant earaches, tinnitus, congestion, headaches, vertigo, heart palpitations and muscle pain, to name just a few. Many days, Hawthorne feels so debilitated that she can barely get out of bed, which her doctors are blaming on \u201clong covid\u201d as opposed to the shots she received. (Related: It was Tony Fauci\u2019s wife Christine who pulled the strings to get children enrolled in clot shot trials.) Fearful about how tiny blood clots throughout the body are often to blame for long covid symptoms such as these, Hawthorne reached out to a physician in Germany who specifically treats people like herself using blood thinners and a dialysis-type process to filter and cleanse the blood. Since there are now so many people sick and dying from the injections, Hawthorne has yet to hear back. There is apparently a waiting list a mile long with names of people who took the jabs, thought they were \u201cprotected,\u201d and are now suffering day in and day out from all kinds of illnesses. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait on my health when I\u2019m feeling so dreadful,\u201d Hawthorne complained to Nature. How long will science be \u201cbaffled\u201d by what are clearly post-injection adverse events? Researchers are reportedly \u201cbaffled by long covid\u201d because they cannot figure out what is causing it \u2013 since they refuse to even consider the possibility that the shots are to blame. An increasing number of people who took the jabs are experiencing ever-growing clots inside their bodies that are slowing and halting blood flow, eventually leading to death. There is even a movement on Twitter called \u201c#teamclots\u201d that is raising awareness about the issue, but of course denying the elephant in the room known as the injections, which are the only logical cause of these clots. Some desperate folks are resorting to their own remedies for these clots, to which the scientific establishment is already screaming stop! because such treatments are supposedly unproven. \u201cWe\u2019ve now got little scattered bits of evidence,\u201d says Danny Altmann, an immunologist at Imperial College London, about so-called long covid. Altmann, like his colleagues, will not dare to call out the jabs. \u201cWe\u2019re all scuttling to try and put it together in some kind of consensus. We\u2019re so far away from that. It\u2019s very unsatisfying.\u201d Nature is still referring to the clots as blood clots, even though evidence has emerged to suggest that the clots forming inside the bodies of the \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d are metallic, among other strange, non-blood substances. It is almost as if the jabs are causing people\u2019s bodies to form non-lifeform clots out of foreign substances that are contained within or produced by whatever is inside the \u201cvaccine\u201d vials. Under a microscope, Nature admits, these clots resemble \u201ca nice plate of spaghetti\u201d with a \u201chorrible, gunky, and dark\u201d appearance \u201csuch as you might get if you half-boiled the spaghetti and let it all stick together,\u201d to quote Douglas Kell, a systems biologist at The University of Liverpool. Kell and his colleagues have put together material suggesting that the fibrin in the clots has misfolded, creating a glue-like \u201camyloid\u201d version of itself. \u201cIf the first one changes its conformation, all the others have to follow suit,\u201d Kell says, noting that the process is much like the misfolding of prions, which can lead to conditions such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

        "text":"(Natural News) After years of silencing the truth, Google is revising their \u201cmisinformation policy.\u201d For two and a half years, Google and YouTube banned anyone who criticized masks and covid-19 vaccines. Now, Google and YouTube are tweaking their censorship algorithms to allow debate on some issues related to mask mandates and the infamous clot-shot covid-19 vaccines. With this move, the Google elite are admitting that they lied about masking and covid-19 vaccines. Big Tech is complicit in withholding critical medical information that is essential in the informed consent process. By dispensing faulty and sometimes deadly medical advice and by silencing the truth, Google and the Big Tech elite are also liable for the crimes against humanity taking place all around the world. Google\/YouTube censors the harms associated with COVID-19 vaccines and lies about treatments In January 2022, YouTube\u2019s rules on COVID disinformation forbid all criticism of masks. Claims that masks do not play a role in preventing covid-19 were barred, even though it had become obvious by the end of 2020 that masks were theater and could not stop the advertised virus. Claims that masks were dangerous and were harmful to one\u2019s physical health were also barred, even though the harms were obvious, especially in children. To this day, the long term mental and social health issues are apparent in those who bought into lockdowns, masks and medical tyranny. The YouTube rules also prohibited any claims about the mRNA vaccines being unable to reduce contraction and\/or transmission of COVID-19. YouTube banned users for stating obvious facts about the failure of covid-19 vaccines earlier in the year. Today, Google and YouTube still have a covid-19 misinformation policy that bans a variety of truthful discussions about the vaccines, treatments and the associated medical tyranny. Among the topics still barred from discussion include: \u2022 Claims that COVID-19 vaccines do not reduce risk of serious illness or death. Individuals who speak out about serious illness and death in their family following the covid-19 vaccine are banned from the platform. Just as Alex Jones was sued for defamation for stating that no children died at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Google should also be sued for defamation for claiming that the covid-19 vaccines have not killed a single person. The Big Tech elite are in denial of mass murder, but they refuse to apologize to the public and the victims. \u2022 Claims that an approved COVID-19 vaccine will alter a person\u2019s genetic makeup. Scientists who have proven various aspects of this process are banned from the discussion. \u2022 Claims that ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine are safe to use in the prevention of COVID-19. Doctors who use cheap, effective medicines for the treatment of covid-19 are banned from the discussion. \u2022 Claims that any vaccine causes contraction of COVID-19. People who got sick after being vaccinated are banned from commenting, even though the CDC admits that breakthrough infections occur after vaccination. \u2022 Claims that an approved COVID-19 vaccine will contain substances that are not on the vaccine ingredient list, such as biological matter from fetuses or animal products. Anyone who dares mention the truth of fetal cell lines used in the development of vaccines is banned from the platform. \u2022 The censorship list goes on and on, reprimanding individuals for thinking, feeling, speculating, experiencing, studying, testifying, and\/or reporting on issues related to covid-19, the government\u2019s response, the so-called vaccine and all related fraud, abuse and medical tyranny. Google and YouTube are used as weapons of mass mind control and delusion Throughout the covid-19 scandal, Google has been used as a mind control device, directing the flow of information to maximize the public\u2019s compliance with insidious edicts put forth by the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and the World Economic Forum. Algorithms are designed for social engineering \u2014 to bury the truth and promote the lies, brainwashing the public with virtue-signaling ignorance and delusion, while instilling submissive traits and group think. Over time, some of this mass formation psychosis and programming will wear off, as human strength rises to the occasion. The expression of truth cannot be denied for long. Not even cognitive dissonance can smother the purity of truth. Almost every single aspect of Google\/YouTube\u2019s covid-19 misinformation policy can be refuted, rationally debated, discarded as harmful medical advice and used as evidence to prove Big Tech\u2019s complicity in crimes against humanity.

        "text":"(Natural News) The Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines purportedly reprogram the immune system to turn against the body, causing lymphocytes to attack important organs. Arne Burkhardt and Walter Lang, two pathology professors from Germany, held a press conference to explain this phenomenon. They presented an analysis of 10 autopsies from people who died soon after their COVID-19 vaccination. All 10 individuals were aged 50, and died at various intervals in the two weeks following their vaccination. Microscopic studies of tissue samples from the deceased individuals yielded an interesting find \u2013 the occurrence of a \u201clymphocyte riot.\u201d Burkhardt and Lang discovered an alarming number of lymphocytes in various organs such as the liver, kidneys, spleen and uterus. The lymphocytes vigorously attacked the tissues in the organs and caused serious damage. (Related: Evidence shows COVID vaccines cause serious damage to the immune system.) This autoimmune horror could only be attributed to the COVID-19 vaccination. Burkhardt and two other pathologists attested to this, verifying that the vaccines triggered this pathogenesis in five of the 10 deceased individuals. However, the medical examiners refused to acknowledge the COVID-19 shot\u2019s role in the demise of the victims. Two of the cases reported the vaccination as a \u201cprobable\u201d cause of death, while two others were noted as \u201crather coincident\u201d or \u201cpossibly\u201d caused by the vaccine. Regardless, Burkhardt emphasized that autoimmune diseases were among the deadly side effects of the COVID-19 shot. He outlined such conditions found in the vaccinated victims such as Sjogren\u2019s syndrome (lymphocytes attacking the glands that produce tears and saliva), leucoclasmic vasculitis of the skin (blood vessels in the skin becoming inflamed) and Hashimoto\u2019s disease (inflammation of the thyroid gland). Several of the deaths were caused by lymphocytic myocarditis, which is caused by the lymphocytes attacking and damaging the heart muscle. While the disease occurs in both young and old people after their COVID-19 vaccination, it is often misunderstood as a general infarction and blamed on other factors. Burkhardt also criticized medical coding standards utilized for finalizing death certificates that were currently in place. He dubbed these as \u201ccompletely unsuitable\u201d and \u201cultimately statically worthless,\u201d because they make unclear arguments and do not refer to specific medical evidence. Vaccines kill: Burkhardt and Lang\u2019s findings confirm results of an earlier analysis Burkhardt and Lang\u2019s findings attested to the results of an earlier analysis, which looked at more autopsies. Back in August 2021, Dr. Peter Schirmacher examined 40 autopsies of people who died within two weeks of getting their COVID-19 vaccine dose. Schirmacher, a professor at Heidelberg University, concluded that one-third of the people died from the vaccination immediately, either through cerebral vein thrombosis or autoimmune diseases. He displayed microscopic details of serious tissue damage induced by the vaccines to back up his claim Despite criticism from health authorities, he received support from his fellow pathologists. The Federal Association of German Pathologists threw its support behind Schirmacher, stating that more autopsies of vaccinated people who died within a certain time frame after vaccination should be performed. For his part, Schirmacher responded to the criticism by denying that he lacked competence. \u201cThe colleagues are definitely wrong, because they cannot assess this specific question competently,\u201d he said. Schirmacher also denied allegations that he was trying to spread panic and rebuked allegations that he was an opponent of vaccinations, citing the fact that he himself was vaccinated.

Pharmaceutical companies will be able to update their current COVID-19 jabs to include \u201can omicron BA.4\/5 spike protein component to the current vaccine composition to create a two-component (bivalent) booster vaccine.\u201d The modified versions are expected to be available as boosters in time for the \u201ccold and flu\u201d season. (Related: FDA\u2019s \u201cFuture Framework\u201d allows Big Pharma corporations to unleash reformulated covid vaccines without any clinical trials.)

He further cited political economist Toby Roger\u2019s Substack article explaining the origin and purpose of this dangerous move by the FDA. Rogers said that everyone now knows that the mRNA COVID-19 shots do not stop infection, transmission, hospitalization or death from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, Pfizer and Moderna are making about $50 billion a year on these shots and so they want that to continue. To do this, they would need to reformulate the shots, maybe target a new variant or change some of the ingredients. \u201cSince reformulated shots mean new clinical trials and new regulatory review by the FDA, there is a decent chance that any reformulated shot might fail new testing and the public is deeply skeptical of these shots so the scrutiny would be intense. So, Big Pharma figured out a way to use regulatory capture to get their reformulated COVID-19 shots approved without further clinical trials,\u201d he pointed out. Mercola further said the people have seen plenty of examples of how vaccine trials are being rigged and that the \u201cframework\u201d is an extreme expansion and formalization of that rigging. \u201cNot recording injuries, or recording them improperly, is a common tactic used to fudge results and make a vaccine appear safer than it is. Another common strategy is to exclude any parameter that turns out to be problematic, and that includes participants who are injured. Because this is such a common trick, the fact that 3,000 of the 4,526 children (aged six months through four years) enrolled in Pfizer\u2019s pediatric COVID trial were excluded is a huge red flag,\u201d he said. Rogers: WHO, Gates Foundation could be behind the scheme According to Rogers, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation could be the masterminds behind the scheme. \u201cGates requires that WHO use the McKinsey consulting firm so this is probably a McKinsey operation (and McKinsey also works for Pharma so this is a huge conflict of interest). As Naomi Wolf points out, the involvement of the WHO also raises troubling questions about the influence of the Chinese Communist Party over this process,\u201d he wrote.

        "text":"(Natural News) The Health Ranger sat down recently with Jonathan Landsman to talk about the explosion of cancer cases that many doctors are seeing in the age of Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccines.\u201d Landsman is a natural health veteran who has been focused on cancer for some years now, observing details that often fall through the cracks linking the disease to modern medicine. In this case, Fauci Flu shots were unleashed under Operation Warp Speed, and now some cancers are raging at rates 1,000 percent higher than previously. (Related: Covid jab spike proteins destroy human DNA, paving the way for the growth and spread of cancer cells.) \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is, the spike proteins \u2026 are attaching and decreasing the ACE2 receptor expression,\u201d Landsman explained to the Health Ranger, emphasizing that ACE2 receptors are located all throughout the body. \u201cThese spike proteins are spreading and infecting all the cells in the body. And what\u2019s happening is this is allowing those infections to attach to the outside of the cell, and then inject themselves inside the cell, causing organ damage and severe illness \u2026 and is especially increasing the risk of advanced-stage cancers.\u201d You can watch the full interview from Brighteon.com below: It is only a matter of time before every fully jabbed person experiences the consequences of the shots Landsman says he gets emails every single day from people who are concerned that covid jabs are causing themselves and their loved ones to get sick, including with cancer. Cancer patients who were previously in remission are now seeing their cancers reappear post-injection, which only further supports the notion that the jabs are responsible. Landsman describes the vaccine spike proteins as the key, and the body\u2019s ACE2 receptors are the doorway through which disease and ultimately death are delivered to a \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d person\u2019s body. Both the government and the corporate-controlled media still insist that mRNA (messenger RNA) technology \u2013 this is what replicates spike protein production throughout the body, just as a reminder, turning it into a spike protein factory \u2013 is not permanent and does not affect DNA. Nothing could be further from the truth. Dr. Judy Mikovits told the Health Ranger in a previous interview that the presence of glyphosate inside the body \u2013 and most people today have this deadly chemical circulating in their bloodstream \u2013 only amplifies the damage caused by vaccine spike proteins. \u201cBecause of the presence of glyphosate, and the fact that there\u2019s a phosphate group in that \u2026 it potentiates the cell membrane pathway that is used by mRNA to enter the cells,\u201d the Health Ranger explained during his interview with Landsman. \u201cWhat that means is \u2026 one of the explanations for why some people are more damaged than others is that some people are eating non-organic foods.\u201d This and so much more is discussed in the interview, which you will not want to miss. \u201cPeople I know are battling breast and brain cancers since they took the Jaberwalkie!\u201d wrote a commenter at Brighteon.com, affirming what Landsman and the Health Ranger are saying. \u201cCancer came back in one person and a relative went to three funerals in one week, but didn\u2019t realize the cause,\u201d added another. \u201cRoundup is everywhere, including in corn syrup, which is used in candy and soda,\u201d added another. \u201cIt is also sprayed on corn, wheat, oats, peanuts, beans, canola oil, and more.\u201d Be sure to check out the Stop Cancer Class, which is Landsman\u2019s docu-class for avoiding and overcoming cancer, to learn more.

        "link":"https:\/\/www.naturalnews.com\/2022-09-01-sotomayor-defends-nyc-covid-jab-mandate-workers.html",
        "text":"(Natural News) Efforts to stop New York City politicians from forcing city employees to get \u201cvaccinated\u201d for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) are seeing another setback after Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a Barack Hussein Obama appointee, turned down a request by New York Police Department (NYPD) detective Anthony Marciano to reinstate a temporary restraining order against the mandate. The order was issued in late 2021 by a New York judge, only to later be dissolved by a federal court. An appeals court also rejected a request for a stay pending appeal, which ultimately led to Sotomayor receiving Marciano\u2019s request. (Related: Kathy Hochul dropped the mandate for MTA workers after hordes of them quit in protest.) A lawyer for Marciano stated that the mandate is causing his client irreparable harm as his due process rights are being infringed. The covid jab mandate is also a violation of both state and federal law, the lawyer argued. \u201cA majority of this Court would likely agree the Mayor of the City of New York has no executive authority that permits him to mandate an EUA Covid 19 vaccination, that is prohibited under existing NYS and federal laws from being imposed on any adult in NYC, employee or otherwise,\u201d the brief reads. \u201cNonetheless, the challenged adult-vaccination-mandate requires all NYC municipal workers receive an EUA Covid 19 vaccination, with or without requisite informed consent, and \/ or with or without a Judicial Order of Quarantine PHL \u00a72120 (3), required by state and federal law, or be fired.\u201d In her rejection of Marciano\u2019s request, Sotomayor did not provide any explanation as to her decision. It simply went to her because she happens to be in charge of the United States Court of Appeals 2nd Circuit, which includes the state of New York. Marciano, who has worked for the NYPD for more than 10 years, had applied for a religious exemption to the citywide mandate, only to have it turned down by his superiors. He is still employed by the department. Forcing people to get jabbed for covid aligns with NYC\u2019s charter, courts decide In 2021, New York Supreme Court Judge Frank Nervo entered the temporary block, only to soon after dismiss Marciano\u2019s suit. Nervo decided that NYC health officials have the authority to impose jab mandates. Marciano\u2019s next step was to take the matter to federal court, which ended up being presided over by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, a Bill Clinton appointee. Like Nervo, Rakoff ruled that NYC authorities have the authority to issue jab mandates, citing the decision in Garcia v. New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene. This court found that NYC\u2019s charter \u201cempowers the Department with \u2018jurisdiction to regulate all matters affecting health in the city of New York and to perform all those functions and operations performed by the city that relate to the health of the people of the city,\u2019 including in matter relating to the \u2018control of communicable and chronic disease and conditions hazardous to life and health.'\u201d \u201cA very direct connection\u201d was also found between flu shot requirements and the city\u2019s new covid jab requirements, both of which aim for \u201cthe preservation of health and safety,\u201d according to the courts. \u201cThe same can be said about Board\u2019s requirement that City employees and contractors be vaccinated against COVID-19,\u201d Rakoff declared. The Second Circuit later denied a request for a stay pending appeal, deciding that Marciano had failed to meet the standards for a stay. The appeals court is still overseeing Marciano\u2019s case, and it could end up ruling in his favor.

        "text":"(Natural News) Regular exercise is key to your overall well-being because it can help you maintain a healthy weight. According to a study, exercising for at least 150 minutes or two and a half hours every week can also help reduce your risk of getting infected with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). The study findings were published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Regular exercise and COVID-19 prevention According to research, physical activity is important when it comes to reducing the chance of severe illness because it helps boost your immune system. Experts also believe that staying fit can help protect against COVID-19 after reviewing over a dozen international studies. The data revealed that 150 minutes or more of moderate exercise like brisk walking or dancing every week reduced the risk of a coronavirus infection by 11 percent. (Related: Study: Walking for an extra 10 minutes daily can increase your life expectancy.) The same protective effect was observed in those who exercised for at least 75 minutes or more of vigorous exercise weekly. Activities include running and swimming or sports like football and rugby. Those who exercised regularly were also at least 43 percent less likely to die or get severe COVID-19 compared to their peers. The research team hopes that their findings could help guide \u201ca public health strategy\u201d that would encourage people to exercise regularly. The experts believe that regular physical activity helps the body fight off COVID-19 before it penetrates the body by increasing white blood cell and antibody counts. Exercise as a public health strategy Data suggests that the pandemic was linked to a significant increase in the number of people exercising in general. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the average Briton now spends 25 minutes per day exercising, which is six minutes more than in 2014 and 2015. The National Health Service (NHS) advised people to engage in moderate activity for 75 minutes. Alternatively, people can exercise vigorously for at least 150 minutes per week to maintain overall health. In the latest study, researchers analyzed 16 studies carried out in Brazil, Canada, Iran, Palestine, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The studies were conducted between November 2019 and March 2022. Only studies that used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and had exercise data were included in the analysis. Overall, more than 1.8 million participants were involved in the study. The physical activity levels of the participants were recorded through self-reported questionnaires or data from wearing heart rate monitors and other activity-tracking devices. Most of the studies controlled for other factors, like obesity and smoking, that could affect coronavirus infection. Overall, the studies suggest that exercising regularly reduced the risk of infection by 11 percent and serious illness, defined as needing intensive care or a ventilator, by as much as 34 percent. Physical activity also helped reduce the chance of hospitalization from all causes by 36 percent and death by 43 percent. Yasmin Ezzatvar, a nurse at the University of Valencia who lead the research team, explained that the findings confirm how effective regular physical activity is at protecting against coronavirus. \u201cRegular physical activity seems to be related to a lower likelihood of adverse COVID-19 outcomes,\u201d wrote the study authors. The results also emphasized the protective effects of regular exercise as \u201ca public health strategy, with potential benefits to reduce the risk of severe COVID-19.\u201d The research team explained that exercise could help reduce the chance of getting severe coronavirus by reducing the chance of developing diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure. These three conditions have been linked with reacting more strongly to the virus. Data is scarce on why exercise limits the chances of actually catching COVID-19, but the researchers think physical activity could help increase the body\u2019s immune defense. Other studies suggest that exercise helps the body produce more antibodies and white blood cells, which are key to the body\u2019s response to infection. Physical activity also reduces the release of the stress hormone cortisol that can reduce the number of disease-fighting white blood cells produced in your body. How does regular exercise benefit your immune system? A healthy immune system helps protect you from different disease-causing bacteria, viruses and other pathogens. Here are several ways physical activity can help boost your immune system: It can reduce your risk of developing heart disease, diabetes and other diseases Exercise can help reduce cardiovascular risk factors, prevent or delay the development of Type 2 diabetes, increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol and lower resting heart rate. Having one or more of these conditions may make it more difficult for your immune system to protect you against infections and viral illnesses like COVID-19. It can reduce stress and other conditions like depression Working out after a long day can help reduce your stress. Specifically, moderate-intensity exercise can slow down the release of stress hormones while also positively influencing the neurotransmitters in your brain that affect mood and behavior. Additionally, regular physical activity may offer a protective benefit against stress. This means that if you exercise regularly, you can proactively handle stressors with more resilience and a better mood. Data suggests that stress and depression can significantly affect the regular function of your immune system, which can cause a low chronic inflammation status that favors infections, diseases and other illnesses. It can help you sleep better If you have trouble sleeping at night, exercising regularly can help improve both sleep quantity and quality. This is good because sleep loss can negatively affect certain parts of the immune system. Study findings suggest that a higher risk of infection and development of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders may be linked to a reduction in antibodies and the production of inflammatory cytokines in those with a modest amount of sleep loss. Improve your health condition and protect yourself against COVID-19 by engaging in moderate exercise for at least two hours and 30 minutes every week.

        "link":"https:\/\/www.naturalnews.com\/2022-09-01-vaccines-reprogram-immune-system-attack-organs.html",
        "text":"(Natural News) The Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines purportedly reprogram the immune system to turn against the body, causing lymphocytes to attack important organs. Arne Burkhardt and Walter Lang, two pathology professors from Germany, held a press conference to explain this phenomenon. They presented an analysis of 10 autopsies from people who died soon after their COVID-19 vaccination. All 10 individuals were aged 50, and died at various intervals in the two weeks following their vaccination. Microscopic studies of tissue samples from the deceased individuals yielded an interesting find \u2013 the occurrence of a \u201clymphocyte riot.\u201d Burkhardt and Lang discovered an alarming number of lymphocytes in various organs such as the liver, kidneys, spleen and uterus. The lymphocytes vigorously attacked the tissues in the organs and caused serious damage. (Related: Evidence shows COVID vaccines cause serious damage to the immune system.) This autoimmune horror could only be attributed to the COVID-19 vaccination. Burkhardt and two other pathologists attested to this, verifying that the vaccines triggered this pathogenesis in five of the 10 deceased individuals. However, the medical examiners refused to acknowledge the COVID-19 shot\u2019s role in the demise of the victims. Two of the cases reported the vaccination as a \u201cprobable\u201d cause of death, while two others were noted as \u201crather coincident\u201d or \u201cpossibly\u201d caused by the vaccine. Regardless, Burkhardt emphasized that autoimmune diseases were among the deadly side effects of the COVID-19 shot. He outlined such conditions found in the vaccinated victims such as Sjogren\u2019s syndrome (lymphocytes attacking the glands that produce tears and saliva), leucoclasmic vasculitis of the skin (blood vessels in the skin becoming inflamed) and Hashimoto\u2019s disease (inflammation of the thyroid gland). Several of the deaths were caused by lymphocytic myocarditis, which is caused by the lymphocytes attacking and damaging the heart muscle. While the disease occurs in both young and old people after their COVID-19 vaccination, it is often misunderstood as a general infarction and blamed on other factors. Burkhardt also criticized medical coding standards utilized for finalizing death certificates that were currently in place. He dubbed these as \u201ccompletely unsuitable\u201d and \u201cultimately statically worthless,\u201d because they make unclear arguments and do not refer to specific medical evidence. Vaccines kill: Burkhardt and Lang\u2019s findings confirm results of an earlier analysis Burkhardt and Lang\u2019s findings attested to the results of an earlier analysis, which looked at more autopsies. Back in August 2021, Dr. Peter Schirmacher examined 40 autopsies of people who died within two weeks of getting their COVID-19 vaccine dose. Schirmacher, a professor at Heidelberg University, concluded that one-third of the people died from the vaccination immediately, either through cerebral vein thrombosis or autoimmune diseases. He displayed microscopic details of serious tissue damage induced by the vaccines to back up his claim Despite criticism from health authorities, he received support from his fellow pathologists. The Federal Association of German Pathologists threw its support behind Schirmacher, stating that more autopsies of vaccinated people who died within a certain time frame after vaccination should be performed. For his part, Schirmacher responded to the criticism by denying that he lacked competence. \u201cThe colleagues are definitely wrong, because they cannot assess this specific question competently,\u201d he said. Schirmacher also denied allegations that he was trying to spread panic and rebuked allegations that he was an opponent of vaccinations, citing the fact that he himself was vaccinated.

According to reports, the vaccine industry has decided to not finish testing the injections on humans before asking the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve them. And it appears that the FDA is fully on board with the plan. Rather than wait to see how the jabs perform in real-life humans, the FDA is slated to just pull random data from animal research involving other jabs to issue authorization for the new covid booster jabs. \u201cReal world evidence from the current mRNA Covid-19 vaccines, which have been administered to millions of individuals, show us that the vaccines are safe,\u201d declared current FDA Commissioner Robert Califf in a tweet. When pressed for further comment, the FDA pointed inquirers to Califf\u2019s tweet and Twitter page. (Related: Both the European Union and the World Health Organization have warned that covid \u201cbooster\u201d shots are dangerous.) When even Paul Offit is speaking out, you know you\u2019ve jumped the shark The FDA takes the same approach to approving seasonal flu shots, which change from year to year depending on what the government claims is the most prominent circulating strain. Instead of relying on sound scientific data for each individual type of injection, the FDA just assumes that each new jab formulation is the same as all the others: perfectly \u201csafe and effective.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m uncomfortable that we would move forward \u2013 that we would give millions or tens of millions of doses to people \u2013 based on mouse data,\u201d said Paul Offit, an FDA adviser and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. As you may recall from past reporting, Paul Offit \u201cFor Profit\u201d has long been a heavy proponent of vaccines. He once stated that a child could receive 10,000 vaccine doses at once and be just fine. This was before Operation Warp Speed, though. Offit now speaks like many of us, expressing perplexity at the new rules of the game that say no testing required when it comes to new injections.

        "text":"(Natural News) We are told that the newest formulation of Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cbooster\u201d shot for the \u201cOmicron\u201d (Moronic) subvariant is ready for public release, even though the mystery concoction has never been safety tested. According to reports, the vaccine industry has decided to not finish testing the injections on humans before asking the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve them. And it appears that the FDA is fully on board with the plan. Rather than wait to see how the jabs perform in real-life humans, the FDA is slated to just pull random data from animal research involving other jabs to issue authorization for the new covid booster jabs. \u201cReal world evidence from the current mRNA Covid-19 vaccines, which have been administered to millions of individuals, show us that the vaccines are safe,\u201d declared current FDA Commissioner Robert Califf in a tweet. When pressed for further comment, the FDA pointed inquirers to Califf\u2019s tweet and Twitter page. (Related: Both the European Union and the World Health Organization have warned that covid \u201cbooster\u201d shots are dangerous.) When even Paul Offit is speaking out, you know you\u2019ve jumped the shark The FDA takes the same approach to approving seasonal flu shots, which change from year to year depending on what the government claims is the most prominent circulating strain. Instead of relying on sound scientific data for each individual type of injection, the FDA just assumes that each new jab formulation is the same as all the others: perfectly \u201csafe and effective.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m uncomfortable that we would move forward \u2013 that we would give millions or tens of millions of doses to people \u2013 based on mouse data,\u201d said Paul Offit, an FDA adviser and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. As you may recall from past reporting, Paul Offit \u201cFor Profit\u201d has long been a heavy proponent of vaccines. He once stated that a child could receive 10,000 vaccine doses at once and be just fine. This was before Operation Warp Speed, though. Offit now speaks like many of us, expressing perplexity at the new rules of the game that say no testing required when it comes to new injections. Offit supports a no testing modality for flu shots because he says influenza strains mutate too fast for Big Pharma to keep up. For covid, he is against the idea of the FDA just rubber-stamping approval based on little or no testing. We are told that the FDA will not only not be requiring any new human clinical trials, it will also not be convening its advisory members who would normally evaluate the data and make appropriate recommendations.

        "text":"(Natural News) The Nature journal published a new feature highlighting an epidemic of \u201clong covid\u201d that is afflicting the triple-vaccinated. People like Lara Hawthorne, a British illustrator who took three shots and \u201cfelt quite protected,\u201d are now suffering strange illnesses linked to clots caused by the injections. Hawthorne told Nature that she has been sick for months now with a variety of \u201coften debilitating symptoms\u201d including constant earaches, tinnitus, congestion, headaches, vertigo, heart palpitations and muscle pain, to name just a few. Many days, Hawthorne feels so debilitated that she can barely get out of bed, which her doctors are blaming on \u201clong covid\u201d as opposed to the shots she received. (Related: It was Tony Fauci\u2019s wife Christine who pulled the strings to get children enrolled in clot shot trials.) Fearful about how tiny blood clots throughout the body are often to blame for long covid symptoms such as these, Hawthorne reached out to a physician in Germany who specifically treats people like herself using blood thinners and a dialysis-type process to filter and cleanse the blood. Since there are now so many people sick and dying from the injections, Hawthorne has yet to hear back. There is apparently a waiting list a mile long with names of people who took the jabs, thought they were \u201cprotected,\u201d and are now suffering day in and day out from all kinds of illnesses. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait on my health when I\u2019m feeling so dreadful,\u201d Hawthorne complained to Nature. How long will science be \u201cbaffled\u201d by what are clearly post-injection adverse events? Researchers are reportedly \u201cbaffled by long covid\u201d because they cannot figure out what is causing it \u2013 since they refuse to even consider the possibility that the shots are to blame. An increasing number of people who took the jabs are experiencing ever-growing clots inside their bodies that are slowing and halting blood flow, eventually leading to death. There is even a movement on Twitter called \u201c#teamclots\u201d that is raising awareness about the issue, but of course denying the elephant in the room known as the injections, which are the only logical cause of these clots. Some desperate folks are resorting to their own remedies for these clots, to which the scientific establishment is already screaming stop! because such treatments are supposedly unproven. \u201cWe\u2019ve now got little scattered bits of evidence,\u201d says Danny Altmann, an immunologist at Imperial College London, about so-called long covid. Altmann, like his colleagues, will not dare to call out the jabs. \u201cWe\u2019re all scuttling to try and put it together in some kind of consensus. We\u2019re so far away from that. It\u2019s very unsatisfying.\u201d Nature is still referring to the clots as blood clots, even though evidence has emerged to suggest that the clots forming inside the bodies of the \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d are metallic, among other strange, non-blood substances. It is almost as if the jabs are causing people\u2019s bodies to form non-lifeform clots out of foreign substances that are contained within or produced by whatever is inside the \u201cvaccine\u201d vials. Under a microscope, Nature admits, these clots resemble \u201ca nice plate of spaghetti\u201d with a \u201chorrible, gunky, and dark\u201d appearance \u201csuch as you might get if you half-boiled the spaghetti and let it all stick together,\u201d to quote Douglas Kell, a systems biologist at The University of Liverpool. Kell and his colleagues have put together material suggesting that the fibrin in the clots has misfolded, creating a glue-like \u201camyloid\u201d version of itself. \u201cIf the first one changes its conformation, all the others have to follow suit,\u201d Kell says, noting that the process is much like the misfolding of prions, which can lead to conditions such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

        "title":"Study: 150 Minutes of moderate exercise a week can help reduce risk of COVID-19 infections",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.naturalnews.com\/2022-09-01-150minutes-moderate-exercise-weekly-can-prevent-covid.html",
        "text":"(Natural News) Regular exercise is key to your overall well-being because it can help you maintain a healthy weight. According to a study, exercising for at least 150 minutes or two and a half hours every week can also help reduce your risk of getting infected with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). The study findings were published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Regular exercise and COVID-19 prevention According to research, physical activity is important when it comes to reducing the chance of severe illness because it helps boost your immune system. Experts also believe that staying fit can help protect against COVID-19 after reviewing over a dozen international studies. The data revealed that 150 minutes or more of moderate exercise like brisk walking or dancing every week reduced the risk of a coronavirus infection by 11 percent. (Related: Study: Walking for an extra 10 minutes daily can increase your life expectancy.) The same protective effect was observed in those who exercised for at least 75 minutes or more of vigorous exercise weekly. Activities include running and swimming or sports like football and rugby. Those who exercised regularly were also at least 43 percent less likely to die or get severe COVID-19 compared to their peers. The research team hopes that their findings could help guide \u201ca public health strategy\u201d that would encourage people to exercise regularly. The experts believe that regular physical activity helps the body fight off COVID-19 before it penetrates the body by increasing white blood cell and antibody counts. Exercise as a public health strategy Data suggests that the pandemic was linked to a significant increase in the number of people exercising in general. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the average Briton now spends 25 minutes per day exercising, which is six minutes more than in 2014 and 2015. The National Health Service (NHS) advised people to engage in moderate activity for 75 minutes. Alternatively, people can exercise vigorously for at least 150 minutes per week to maintain overall health. In the latest study, researchers analyzed 16 studies carried out in Brazil, Canada, Iran, Palestine, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The studies were conducted between November 2019 and March 2022. Only studies that used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and had exercise data were included in the analysis. Overall, more than 1.8 million participants were involved in the study. The physical activity levels of the participants were recorded through self-reported questionnaires or data from wearing heart rate monitors and other activity-tracking devices. Most of the studies controlled for other factors, like obesity and smoking, that could affect coronavirus infection. Overall, the studies suggest that exercising regularly reduced the risk of infection by 11 percent and serious illness, defined as needing intensive care or a ventilator, by as much as 34 percent. Physical activity also helped reduce the chance of hospitalization from all causes by 36 percent and death by 43 percent. Yasmin Ezzatvar, a nurse at the University of Valencia who lead the research team, explained that the findings confirm how effective regular physical activity is at protecting against coronavirus. \u201cRegular physical activity seems to be related to a lower likelihood of adverse COVID-19 outcomes,\u201d wrote the study authors. The results also emphasized the protective effects of regular exercise as \u201ca public health strategy, with potential benefits to reduce the risk of severe COVID-19.\u201d The research team explained that exercise could help reduce the chance of getting severe coronavirus by reducing the chance of developing diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure. These three conditions have been linked with reacting more strongly to the virus. Data is scarce on why exercise limits the chances of actually catching COVID-19, but the researchers think physical activity could help increase the body\u2019s immune defense. Other studies suggest that exercise helps the body produce more antibodies and white blood cells, which are key to the body\u2019s response to infection. Physical activity also reduces the release of the stress hormone cortisol that can reduce the number of disease-fighting white blood cells produced in your body. How does regular exercise benefit your immune system? A healthy immune system helps protect you from different disease-causing bacteria, viruses and other pathogens. Here are several ways physical activity can help boost your immune system: It can reduce your risk of developing heart disease, diabetes and other diseases Exercise can help reduce cardiovascular risk factors, prevent or delay the development of Type 2 diabetes, increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol and lower resting heart rate. Having one or more of these conditions may make it more difficult for your immune system to protect you against infections and viral illnesses like COVID-19. It can reduce stress and other conditions like depression Working out after a long day can help reduce your stress. Specifically, moderate-intensity exercise can slow down the release of stress hormones while also positively influencing the neurotransmitters in your brain that affect mood and behavior. Additionally, regular physical activity may offer a protective benefit against stress. This means that if you exercise regularly, you can proactively handle stressors with more resilience and a better mood. Data suggests that stress and depression can significantly affect the regular function of your immune system, which can cause a low chronic inflammation status that favors infections, diseases and other illnesses. It can help you sleep better If you have trouble sleeping at night, exercising regularly can help improve both sleep quantity and quality. This is good because sleep loss can negatively affect certain parts of the immune system. Study findings suggest that a higher risk of infection and development of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders may be linked to a reduction in antibodies and the production of inflammatory cytokines in those with a modest amount of sleep loss. Improve your health condition and protect yourself against COVID-19 by engaging in moderate exercise for at least two hours and 30 minutes every week.

        "text":"(Natural News) As the current heatwave strains California\u2019s already fragile power grid due to high temperatures and rising demand, the state\u2019s utility grid operator is asking residents to avoid charging their electric vehicles. This announcement comes just one week after the state announced a ban on the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035. The California Independent System Operator (CISO), one of the main electricity operators in the state, warned Californians that they may need to avoid charging their electric vehicles as it could put unwanted strain on the state\u2019s power grid, especially over the Labor Day weekend. (Related: GO GREEN, GET BROKE: Test finds new electric Hummer costs over $100 to charge \u2013 more than it costs to fill up most gas tanks.) CISO said it expects that it will have to issue calls for voluntary energy conservation through \u201cFlex alerts\u201d over the Labor Day weekend. \u201cDuring a Flex alert, consumers are urged to reduce energy use from 4 to 9 p.m., when the system is most stressed, because demand for electricity remains high and there is less solar energy available,\u201d reads a CISO press release. The other conservation actions recommended by CISO are setting thermostats to 78 degrees or higher to reduce air conditioner use, avoiding use of large appliances during peak hours and turning off all unnecessary lighting in households. \u201cLowering electricity use during that time will ease strain on the system, and prevent more drastic measures, including rotating power outages,\u201d CISO said. CISO warning hints future grid troubles as more electric cars roll out in the state CISO\u2019s announcement was heavily criticized, especially by Republicans. House Republican Whip Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana was not sympathetic. \u201cCalifornia is now telling people to \u2018avoid using large appliances and charging electric vehicles\u2019 from 4 to 9 p.m. This from the same state that\u2019s going to force everyone to buy electric cars by 2035,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what Democrat control looks like \u2013 and they want it nationwide. What a joke.\u201d Robby Starbuck, former Republican congressional candidate in Tennessee, noted: \u201cThis comes days after California became the first state to ban gas cars by 2035, which means massive pain for the grid there when everyone is forced to drive only electric cars.\u201d \u201cToddlers could run a state more competently than Democrats,\u201d he added. California Gov. Gavin Newsom still claims that the new rule requiring all car sales by 2035 to be for \u201czero-emission vehicles\u201d (ZEVs) is \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d and a necessary effort to tackle the imaginary climate change. \u201cWe can solve this climate crisis if we focus on the big, bold steps necessary to cut pollution,\u201d he said in a statement on Aug. 25. \u201cThis plan\u2019s yearly targets \u2013 35 percent ZEV sales by 2026, 68 percent by 2030 and 100 percent by 2035 \u2013 provide our roadmap to reducing dangerous carbon emissions and moving away from fossil fuels. That\u2019s 915 million oil barrels\u2019 worth of emissions that won\u2019t pollute our communities.\u201d Newsom added that the state will proceed with investing $10 billion in making the transition to 100 percent ZEV \u201ceasier and cheaper for all Californians\u201d who want to purchase electric vehicles.

        "title":"HERBS BEAT COVID: Taiwanese study: Two TCM formulations significantly reduce progression of COVID-19",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.naturalnews.com\/2022-09-01-study-tcm-formulations-significantly-reduce-covid-progression.html",
        "text":"(Natural News) A study performed in Taiwan found that two kinds of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulations significantly reduced disease progression in patients infected with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). The study, whose findings are set to be published in Pharmacological Research in October 2022, was a joint effort by multiple researchers from different Taiwanese institutions. It ran from May 1, 2021 to July 26, 2021 and involved 548 patients. The study participants were given the TCM formulations NRICM101 and NRICM102, which were both developed by the Taiwanese National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine. NRICM101 was formulated in 2020 and became the first TCM treatment to be legally sold in more than 50 countries as a COVID-19 treatment. Ten herbs comprise NRICM101, namely: Scutellaria root Heartleaf houttuynia (Houttuynia cordata) Mongolian snakegourd (Trichosanthes kirilowii) fruit Indigowoad (Isatis tinctoria) root Magnolia (Magnolia officinalis) bark Peppermint (Mentha \u00d7 piperita) Fine leaf Nepeta Mulberry (Morus) leaf Saposhnikovia divaricata root Baked liquorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) root NRICM102 was later formulated based on the earlier NRICM101, with the former\u2019s additional ingredients supporting the respiratory and immune systems. According to the Taiwanese institute, NRICM102\u2019s revised formulation specifically focuses on patients severely ill with COVID-19. The October 2022 study found that COVID-19 patients treated with both NRICM101 and NRICM102 \u201cwere at significantly less risk of [intensive care unit] admission or death, compared to those who were not treated with the herbal formulas.\u201d The researchers chose 246 patients without hypoxia (low oxygen levels in the blood) and 302 patients with normal blood oxygen levels. They then divided both into two groups, and observed them for a period of 30 days. Half of the patients with normal blood oxygen levels received NRICM101, while the remaining 151 received normal care only. Meanwhile, 123 patients with hypoxia were given the NRICM102 formulation while the other half did not. In the normal blood oxygen level group, none of the patients given the TCM formulation progressed to severe COVID-19. Meanwhile, 14 patients from the group who did not receive NRICM101 saw their COVID-19 infections worsen. A similar observation was noted in the hypoxia group. Following the observation period, the use of the later NRICM102 was associated with a 74 percent reduction in the relative risk of death. (Related: Medicinal herbs effectively treat thousands of covid-19 patients in Chinese hospitals.) Herbal medicine can be used as preventative treatment for high-risk individuals According to NRICM Deputy Director Chiou Wen-Fei, two herbs used in the NRICM101 formulation play a key role in addressing COVID-19 infections. She explained that H. cordata and Scutellaria root serve to eliminate SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen responsible for COVID-19. Chiou emphasized, however, that these two herbs taken by themselves alone are not as effective as the multi-herb formula. Back in August 2021, the institute issued several clarifications regarding the use of NRICM101. According to the NRICM, the herbal medicine can be used as a preventative treatment for high-risk individuals. It explained: \u201cDue to COVID-19\u2019s highly infectious nature, proactive prevention in high-risk individuals is recommended. NRICM101 can be prescribed both as a treatment for patients with COVID-19 \u2013 asymptomatic, mild or severe \u2013 and as prevention for high-risk individuals from infection or to reduce symptoms if infected.\u201d The institute also stated that NRICM101 \u201cshould not be consumed by healthy individuals or those who are at low risk of COVID-19 infection.\u201d It warned of \u201cminor side effects \u2013 such as indigestion, diarrhea and fatigue \u2013 in children with [a] weaker body constitution, [the] elderly and those with sensitive digestive tracts.\u201d NRICM Director Dr. Su Yi-Chang lauded TCM during the 14th Taipei Traditional Chinese Medicine International Forum. According to him, TCM differs from its Western counterpart for two reasons. First, its formulations are designed to be multi-targeted compared to Western drugs that target one symptom at a time. Second, Chinese medicine uses lower dosages \u2013 resulting in fewer side effects and a smaller chance of drug resistance.

        "text":"(Natural News) Jane Adams, a businesswoman and former congressional candidate for Nevada, spoke to Owen Shroyer of InfoWars about how she felt pressured to take the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, and how she regrets it because of the severe adverse effects she experienced. Adams ran to be the Republican Party\u2019s candidate for Nevada\u2019s first congressional district, but lost in the primaries. Last year, when she was applying to work at the office of a member of Congress, she found out that she wouldn\u2019t even be considered if she was unvaccinated. This is why, in Sept. 2021, Adams got the first dose of Moderna\u2019s mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. At the time, Nevada had a COVID-19 vaccine mandate in place for students in higher education, state workers and contractors and workers in high-risk fields like healthcare and corrections. This mandate has since been rescinded, except for healthcare workers. \u201cI resisted for a while, [but] I really wanted the job,\u201d said Adams. \u201cSo, I went and got the vaccine, and the results were pretty bad.\u201d \u201cIt was voluntary,\u201d admitted Adams of her own experience. \u201cAnd I think a lot of people can be pressured into doing something. Just through peer pressure, through propaganda.\u201d Adams\u2019 first symptoms started one to two weeks after the injection. She noted that she wasn\u2019t certain when the symptoms began because she was not sure if they were symptoms or not. (Related: Autopsy confirms Kansas woman died due to allergic reaction to Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.) Her first symptom was soreness at the injection site, which she shrugged off. \u201cThey keep saying, \u2018Your arm will be sore, it\u2019s fine,'\u201d she recalled. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t go away.\u201d \u201cI was supposed to get two doses, and after the first dose, I realized I wasn\u2019t going to be able to complete the doses. I had a very bad reaction,\u201d said Adams. After experiencing sharp stabbing pains at the injection site in her arm, she started getting \u201cextremely exhausted [with] heavy fatigue\u2026 It was so extreme, it was almost like narcolepsy.\u201d The sharp pain in her arm then spread to the rest of her body, including her legs.

        "text":"(Natural News) Jane Adams, a businesswoman and former congressional candidate for Nevada, spoke to Owen Shroyer of InfoWars about how she felt pressured to take the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, and how she regrets it because of the severe adverse effects she experienced. Adams ran to be the Republican Party\u2019s candidate for Nevada\u2019s first congressional district, but lost in the primaries. Last year, when she was applying to work at the office of a member of Congress, she found out that she wouldn\u2019t even be considered if she was unvaccinated. This is why, in Sept. 2021, Adams got the first dose of Moderna\u2019s mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. At the time, Nevada had a COVID-19 vaccine mandate in place for students in higher education, state workers and contractors and workers in high-risk fields like healthcare and corrections. This mandate has since been rescinded, except for healthcare workers. \u201cI resisted for a while, [but] I really wanted the job,\u201d said Adams. \u201cSo, I went and got the vaccine, and the results were pretty bad.\u201d \u201cIt was voluntary,\u201d admitted Adams of her own experience. \u201cAnd I think a lot of people can be pressured into doing something. Just through peer pressure, through propaganda.\u201d Adams\u2019 first symptoms started one to two weeks after the injection. She noted that she wasn\u2019t certain when the symptoms began because she was not sure if they were symptoms or not. (Related: Autopsy confirms Kansas woman died due to allergic reaction to Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.) Her first symptom was soreness at the injection site, which she shrugged off. \u201cThey keep saying, \u2018Your arm will be sore, it\u2019s fine,'\u201d she recalled. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t go away.\u201d \u201cI was supposed to get two doses, and after the first dose, I realized I wasn\u2019t going to be able to complete the doses. I had a very bad reaction,\u201d said Adams. After experiencing sharp stabbing pains at the injection site in her arm, she started getting \u201cextremely exhausted [with] heavy fatigue\u2026 It was so extreme, it was almost like narcolepsy.\u201d The sharp pain in her arm then spread to the rest of her body, including her legs. People forced to take vaccines have no recourse if they experience side effects Shroyer noted that this situation is frustrating because if people like Adams experience adverse effects after being forced to get vaccinated, they can\u2019t sue the COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty much above the law,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so, it\u2019s really a sad situation that so many people were either pressured into getting the vaccine or forced to get the vaccine, and if they have a side effect, there\u2019s no recourse.\u201d The host also recalled an interview Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers had with Joe Rogan, where he admitted that he\u2019s unvaccinated and was pressured into lying about his vaccination status to keep his job. \u201cHe said when the NFL sent the health experts to the locker rooms to pressure the players into getting the vaccines, Rodgers asked the guy, \u2018Well, what sort of repercussions or protections do we have if you force us to get a vaccine and we have a side effect?

        "text":"(Natural News) The Health Ranger sat down recently with Jonathan Landsman to talk about the explosion of cancer cases that many doctors are seeing in the age of Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccines.\u201d Landsman is a natural health veteran who has been focused on cancer for some years now, observing details that often fall through the cracks linking the disease to modern medicine. In this case, Fauci Flu shots were unleashed under Operation Warp Speed, and now some cancers are raging at rates 1,000 percent higher than previously. (Related: Covid jab spike proteins destroy human DNA, paving the way for the growth and spread of cancer cells.) \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is, the spike proteins \u2026 are attaching and decreasing the ACE2 receptor expression,\u201d Landsman explained to the Health Ranger, emphasizing that ACE2 receptors are located all throughout the body. \u201cThese spike proteins are spreading and infecting all the cells in the body. And what\u2019s happening is this is allowing those infections to attach to the outside of the cell, and then inject themselves inside the cell, causing organ damage and severe illness \u2026 and is especially increasing the risk of advanced-stage cancers.\u201d You can watch the full interview from Brighteon.com below: It is only a matter of time before every fully jabbed person experiences the consequences of the shots Landsman says he gets emails every single day from people who are concerned that covid jabs are causing themselves and their loved ones to get sick, including with cancer. Cancer patients who were previously in remission are now seeing their cancers reappear post-injection, which only further supports the notion that the jabs are responsible. Landsman describes the vaccine spike proteins as the key, and the body\u2019s ACE2 receptors are the doorway through which disease and ultimately death are delivered to a \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d person\u2019s body. Both the government and the corporate-controlled media still insist that mRNA (messenger RNA) technology \u2013 this is what replicates spike protein production throughout the body, just as a reminder, turning it into a spike protein factory \u2013 is not permanent and does not affect DNA. Nothing could be further from the truth. Dr. Judy Mikovits told the Health Ranger in a previous interview that the presence of glyphosate inside the body \u2013 and most people today have this deadly chemical circulating in their bloodstream \u2013 only amplifies the damage caused by vaccine spike proteins. \u201cBecause of the presence of glyphosate, and the fact that there\u2019s a phosphate group in that \u2026 it potentiates the cell membrane pathway that is used by mRNA to enter the cells,\u201d the Health Ranger explained during his interview with Landsman. \u201cWhat that means is \u2026 one of the explanations for why some people are more damaged than others is that some people are eating non-organic foods.\u201d This and so much more is discussed in the interview, which you will not want to miss. \u201cPeople I know are battling breast and brain cancers since they took the Jaberwalkie!\u201d wrote a commenter at Brighteon.com, affirming what Landsman and the Health Ranger are saying. \u201cCancer came back in one person and a relative went to three funerals in one week, but didn\u2019t realize the cause,\u201d added another. \u201cRoundup is everywhere, including in corn syrup, which is used in candy and soda,\u201d added another. \u201cIt is also sprayed on corn, wheat, oats, peanuts, beans, canola oil, and more.\u201d Be sure to check out the Stop Cancer Class, which is Landsman\u2019s docu-class for avoiding and overcoming cancer, to learn more.

        "title":"Social media Gestapo: Twitter engaged in illegal COLLUSION with CDC to silence anyone questioning covid vaccines",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.naturalnews.com\/2022-08-26-twitter-colluded-cdc-silence-covid-vaccine-questioning.html",
        "text":"(Natural News) It has come to light that tech giant Twitter has been actively colluding with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other government agencies to silence free speech. Carol Crawford, the CDC\u2019s chief of digital media, engaged in conversations with Twitter employees about how to deal with \u201cunapproved opinions\u201d concerning the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19). Part of that exchange included rhetoric about the \u201ctricky\u201d nature of dealing with it, especially since at the time CEO Jack Dorsey was called to testify before Congress about his platform\u2019s censorship habits. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a censoring department,\u201d Dorsey is quoted as saying, even as his people were actively conversing with the CDC and other public health entities about ways to steamroll the First Amendment. (Related: The only time Twitter opposes censorship is when Twitter is being censored by someone else.) Does Twitter have the right to silence whomever it wants? Once Dorsey was through lying to Congress about what Twitter does, the social media platform proceeded to de-platform, shadow-ban and permanently remove doctors, scientists and others who dared to defy the official narrative about the plandemic. All of a sudden, users with \u201cunapproved opinions\u201d were seeing their tweets deleted or their accounts axed. This prompted numerous lawsuits, including one filed by former New York Times science reporter Alex Berenson. Just the other day, in fact, a doctor who raised concerns about Pfizer\u2019s covid \u201cvaccine\u201d records was suspended from the platform. This once again shows that Twitter\u2019s censorship brigade \u2013 you know, the one Dorsey says does not exist \u2013 is alive and well. This continued affront to free speech by Twitter has prompted several doctors, including Jayanta Bhattacharya of Stanford University and Martin Kulldorff of Harvard University to file a joint lawsuit with the states of Missouri and Louisiana against Twitter. The aforementioned doctor who was suspended from Twitter is Dr. Clare Craig, and Bhattacharya, Kulldorff and the two states are coming to bat for her by arguing that Twitter had no right to silence her and her account. \u201cThose doctors were the co-authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, which advocated for a more focused Covid response that targeted the most vulnerable population rather than widespread lockdowns and mandates,\u201d writes Jonathan Turley on his blog about Bhattacharya and Kulldorff. \u201cMany are now questioning the efficacy and cost of the massive lockdown as well as the real value of masks or the rejection of natural immunities as an alternative to vaccination.\u201d Twitter of course opposes the Great Barrington Declaration, viewing it as dangerous because it suggests that the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) may have been created in a Chinese laboratory and released as a bioweapon. Because said research implicates Tony Fauci, who helped fund the illegal gain-of-research that was taking place in Wuhan at the time when the Fauci Flu appeared out of nowhere, Twitter and other Big Tech platforms are trying to keep it hidden away and out of view. \u201cFauci and other leading experts now admit that the lab theory is a real possibility, even if they do not agree that it is the best explanation,\u201d Turley further explains. \u201cSocial media companies like Facebook declared that the previously banned \u2018conspiracy theory\u2019 would now be allowed to be discussed.\u201d \u201cIndeed, many of the views that the media attacked as conspiracy theories or debunked are now again being seriously considered. That includes claims of adverse responses to the vaccines, natural immunity protection, and the psychological costs from masking or isolation, particularly among children. None of these views are inviolate or beyond question \u2013 any more than the official accounts were at the time.\u201d More news about Big Tech\u2019s assault on free speech can be found at Censorship.news.

        "text":"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is preparing to authorize the latest COVID-19 booster shots, developed for the Omicron variant, without first running trials on humans. Instead, the vaccines will rely on testing on mice and will be approved for public use months before human trials are complete. The new Omicron shots will be approved by the FDA this week, the Wall Street Journal reported. The new booster shot will be \u201cbivalent,\u201d meaning it can target the original COVID-19 strain and the Omicron BA.5 subvariant. Despite not having been tested on humans, the vaccination will likely be available to all Americans. Aside from testing on mice, the FDA will also rely on data from current COVID-19 vaccines, and earlier iterations of boosters. The Wall Street Journal noted, \u201cThe Food and Drug Administration is expected to authorize new COVID-19 booster shots this week without a staple of its normal decision-making process: data from a study showing whether the shots were safe and worked in humans.\u201d FDA Commissioner Robert Califf issued a statement on Twitter regarding how the government agency will likely make a decision in granting emergency use authorization (EUA) for booster shots from Moderna and Pfizer. \u201cFDA will rely on the totality of the available evidence in making a decision, including: Clinical trial data from other bivalent mRNA COVID-19 boosters RWE from current COVID-19 vaccines administered to millions of people, non-clinical data for the bivalent BA.4\/5 vaccines, bivalent and multivalent vaccines are very common and modifying a vaccine to include different virus strains often does not require a change in other ingredients,\u201d Califf said on Twitter. Califf claims that approving the mRNA booster shots is comparable to the authorization of the annual flu vaccine. \u201cReal-world evidence from the current mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, which have been administered to millions of individuals, show us that the vaccines are safe,\u201d Califf added. \u201cAs we know from prior experience, strain changes can be made without affecting safety.\u201d Califf declared that the FDA will not hold a meeting about the newest subvariant-targeting vaccines because the \u201cagency feels confident in the extensive discussion that was held in June.\u201d The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) \u201cvoted overwhelmingly to include an Omicron component in COVID-19 boosters,\u201d and that the FDA \u201chas no new questions that warrant committee input,\u201d he added. In June, two health experts wrote an op-ed urging the FDA not to release the booster shots without proper research. The article was written by John P. Moore \u2013 a virologist and professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medicine \u2013 and Paul A. Offit \u2013 a pediatrician, professor of pediatrics, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, and a member of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. Offit told the Wall Street Journal, \u201cI\u2019m uncomfortable that we would move forward \u2014 that we would give millions or tens of millions of doses to people \u2014 based on mouse data.\u201d Moderna has already begun human trials on the booster shots, and Pfizer is expected to begin theirs this month. Experts believe that trials likely wouldn\u2019t be completed until the spring. Earlier this month, White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha expected the boosters to be available by \u201cearly to mid-September.\u201d Jha also said that the Omicron BA.5 subvariant represents 85% to 90% of all U.S. cases of COVID. CDC data shows that less than 50% of Americans received the first booster shot, and 33% of Americans over the age of 50 got the second dose.",

        "title":"The Mark of the Beast \u2013 If You See It, It\u2019s Too Late (Not COVID Vaccine)",
        "link":"https:\/\/escapeallthesethings.com\/mark-of-the-beast\/#comment-37313",
        "text":"The Book of Revelation may be a confusing book overall, but it is crystal clear on \"don't take the Mark of the Beast\" (Rev 14:9). Yet how do you obey that? Can they force the mark on you or trick you into taking it? Find out everything you need to know about the Mark of the Beast today\u2014plus a startling new insight on the months of torture awaiting those who take action too late. If the Antichrist is the most dreaded threat of the Book of Revelation, then his mark would have to be a close second. Just as people wonder who might be the Antichrist today, they also wonder whether the Mark of the Beast is already here, such as in the COVID vaccines or passports. As a result, the following passage from Revelation about the Mark of the Beast is one of the most quoted passages in the Bible: The Mark of the Beast Passage Revelation 13:16-18 (HCSB) \u2014 16 And he [the False Prophet] requires everyone \u2014small and great, rich and poor, free and slave\u2014 to be given a mark on his right hand or on his forehead , 17 so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark : the beast\u2019s name or the number of his name. 18 Here is wisdom:, The one who has understanding must calculate the number of the beast, because it is the number of a man. His number is 666. This passage is talking about the Great Tribulation (Mt 24:21) or the time when the Antichrist (or first Beast of Revelation 13) rules the entire earth. The second beast of Revelation 13, also called the False Prophet (Rev 16:13; 19:20; 20:10), will put in place a system of total control. They will attempt to brand every human with a mark that is needed for commerce. Obviously, without being able to buy or sell anything, you are not going to function in society or last long. It's very important to note two things that everyone seems to ignore: the mark cannot be here until the Antichrist and False Prophet rule. Most mark theorists overlook that. Not A Warning to Bible Readers! (New Insight) More importantly, everyone misses that this passage is not a warning to us, the readers about the mark. It is a prophecy of a warning being proclaimed to the entire world at the start of the Great Tribulation! It goes out because the mark is then present. The warning prophecy gives readers a concept of what it will be like, but not enough detail to figure out exactly what it will be in advance; yet there's no need to, right? When it is here, then the warning will go out. Also, there will be no need for more \"clues\" to identify it as it will be made plainly clear that the mark is what the False Prophet is pushing on people. See how different that is from speculating about what it is today? You see then, there is no need to worry about the mark being here today nor any pressure to identify it now. You can't take it, and \"precursors\" (if such a thing were to exist) don't count! Despite the negatives to refusing the mark, it's plain from another passage that you do have the freewill choice to do that: Revelation 20:4 (HCSB) \u2014 Then I saw thrones, and people seated on them who were given authority to judge. I also saw the people, who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of God\u2019s word, who had not worshiped the beast or his gf image, and who had not accepted the mark on their foreheads or their hands . This passage should reassure those who worry that they can be tricked into taking the mark or forced to take it without their permission. It seems that the False Prophet will need your permission. Otherwise, there would be nobody who \"had not accepted the mark.\" The bad news is that they will not accept your response of \"no, thank you\" kindly. They will try to persuade all people to take the mark through at least four separate pressures or methods of persuasion. Click here to jump to the update on Covid in prophecy Four Powerful Pressures For Taking the Mark The first pressure is what Paul calls the strong delusion (2Th 2:11). The Antichrist will actually succeed in pawning himself off as God on earth ruling from the Third Temple in Jerusalem (2Th 2:4). Jesus said that this deception would be so convincing that even the \"very elect\" would be taken by it if it were possible. Thankfully, it's not possible because God intervenes with the Two Witnesses and 144,000 to preach the truth as an alternative to the popular lie (Mt 24:24). Despite God's counter-programming, the vast majority of the people are going to be convinced that the Antichrist is indeed God. This is due to the convincing signs performed at the hand of the False Prophet. These include calling fire down from heaven and making the image (statue) of the Beast that speaks (Rev 13:13-15). The second pressure takes care of the minority of defiant skeptics who do not fall for the strong delusion. It appears from the passage above that the False Prophet will command death for those who refuse the mark. This is just as he does to those who refuse to worship the image\/statue of the beast (Rev 13:15 = Rev 20:4). Many Christians will have read their Bibles or heard and believed the warning of the mark, but they simply are not martyr-material. They will crumble under the pressure. As Jesus said, the love of believers will wax cold and believers will betray each other to save their own skin (Mt 24:12, 10). Understanding the third and fourth pressures requires a correct understanding of the prophetic roadmap and especially where the Great Tribulation fits in it. Most believe or have been taught that the Great Tribulation begins at the 1st seal. While the white horseman does indeed seem to fit the Antichrist, that's an incorrect conclusion; it actually refers to what Jesus said about the many (religions) that would come in his name, talk about him, and deceive many (Mt 24:5). The real match for the rise of Antichrist and the start of the Great Tribulation is the 5th trumpet. When someone shows you the proof of how the Great Tribulation starts when Satan is cast out of heaven (he has not been cast out yet) as the start of three \"woes,\" the Great Tribulation \/ 5th trumpet connection becomes pretty self-evident (cf. Dan 12:1=Rev 12:7-17=Mt 24:15,21=Rev 9:1-6, 11-13). Once you get that crucial point correct, it opens up the possibility of seeing a couple of other key insights. First, obviously, the 5th Trumpet follows the 4th Trumpet. The 4th Trumpet concludes the sequence of severe global catastrophes on earth caused by near-earth objects (such as Star Wormwood) starting at the 6th seal. This will leave the world in a state of devastation (Rev 6:14; 8:7, 9), fear, panic, chaos (Rev 6:15-16), dark , cold (Rev 8:12), smoke, fires (Rev 8:8-9), water scarcity (Rev 8:10-11) and famine (Rev 8:7, 9, 12). Second, this answers how the Antichrist comes to power. It provides the perfect scenario for the Antichrist as the would-be God and \"Savior of the world\" to appear as the only solution to so many problems\u2014including the severe food shortage. Probably the mark will be presented as part of his plan to solve both the security (identification) and shortages of basic necessities (rationing). (Americans saw a similar thing after the 9-11 attack with the push for a national ID called Real ID.) Thus, the third pressure would be that, given the clear scarcity of food and clean water prior to the rise of the Beast, you will not get your basic living needs met without accepting the mark. The threat of death from thirst and starvation will already be mounting by the time the mark is presented to offer relief. If you do not take it, death will be knocking at the door. Principles and skepticism go out the window in such extreme situations. But there are always stubborn, crafty, and prepared people who would still refuse the mark and scratch out an existence \"off the grid.\" There is apparently another, fourth pressure that will take care of even them. At the 5th Trumpet, we are told that an army of deadly scorpion-like locusts with teeth and stingers are released from imprisonment in the Abyss (Rev 9:1-3). Although lethal-looking (Rev 9:7-9), they do not go out to kill people; they only go out to torture everyone except the 144,000 and the other gathered-protected servants of God (Rev 9:4-5; 7:3-4; 12:13-17). It actually says people will seek death but be unable to find it (Rev 9:6). These demonic creatures will be able to search out every nook and cranny where survivalists and other resistors with stashes of food and ammunition are hiding (Joel 2:9). Their fortification, walls, and weapons will not protect them from the locusts (Joel 2:9). The torture will no doubt be very effective in getting them to accept the mark. Refuse the Mark = 5 Months of Painful Torture The passage telling us that these tortured people \"will seek death and not find it\" during the five months seems like a contradiction with what we said above that the False Prophet will cause those refusing the mark to be killed. But if you think it through carefully, you'll see there is a resolution. It points to a terrifying new realization about the mark that you probably never heard of before: Refusing the mark is not rewarded instantly with death. On the contrary, it is rewarded first with up to five months of torture to persuade you to accept the mark. At the end of the five months of the locusts' torture tour, they finally will put you to death. Why the delay? They may be sadists or they may simply prefer to have Beast kingdom subjects than dead defeated martyrs. (Note, that the locusts passage does not say all people besides God's sealed are tortured. It just says the power is there to do so. Since it makes no sense for the new Antichrist \"God\" to make his first order of business the torture of his admiring subjects, even those who accept him as \"God,\" I think it's a fair deduction that the power to torture is not used on those who take the mark. If he really wanted to capture, mark and torture everyone, then why stop after five months? But if the torture is to force the mark, then it makes sense that the torture is only used for a short time in the beginning. It only takes a few months to find and capture every single living human on earth who is trying to avoid the mark and to try to convince them to change their mind.) Article continues below... The End In 2026? It's Now Possible Since learning in 2001 that Yeshua must return in a Sabbath year, I've had to rule out three Sabbath year cycle windows for the final 7 years (2003-2009, 2010-2016, 2017-2023). With the next window (2024-2030) less than 7 years away, I'm ready to share why I believe, based on the real end time sign of Mt 24:14, that this can be the one. If it is, the \"birth pains\" (WW3 + Wormwood, Lk 21:10-11) would hit near its middle in 2026 with Yeshua returning in 2030. Find out what's changed to convince me about 2026 and what you can do about it... In summary, then, here are the four pressures on people that will make most people accept the mark: The 4 Reasons Why Most People Will Take the Mark Convinced Antichrist is God on earth To avoid beheading To avoid starvation To avoid (up to) five months of torture \"Mark\" Only Figurative? Or Literal? Terrifying, isn't it? Anyone understanding just a fraction of the pressures coming to push the mark on people will naturally want to know exactly what it is now so they can be sure to see it coming. Actually, we'll see later why it is that if you want to successfully avoid it (and keep your life), you must never see it. Yet people still persist in wanting to know what it is now. The first question, then, is to ask is what is the intended meaning of the passage describing the mark? Should we read it literally, as a visible marking on the skin of the hand or forehead or figuratively as something completely different (such as, say, \"Sabbath-breaking\/Sunday worship\" like the Seventh Day Adventists and others believe)? A big reason for doubt about the interpretation of the mark passage comes from an uncannily similar instruction to ancient Israel recorded in the Torah about a sign\/symbol in their forehead and hand (Ex 13:9, 16; Dt 6:8; 11:18): Exodus 13:16 (HCSB) \u2014 So let it be a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead , for the LORD brought us out of Egypt by the strength of His hand. Orthodox Judaism uses this command to justify their tradition of binding \"phylacteries\" to the forehead and hands. However, most agree that ancient Israel did not follow this verse the way modern Judaism does. Instead, they understood it figuratively as telling them to keep the Torah firmly in mind (\"forehead\") and in their actions (the \"hand\"). If you agree with this interpretation, then it's natural to read the very similar passage in Revelation exactly the same way: figuratively (especially in a book like Revelation that is already assumed to be mostly symbolically figurative). But we have to decide how to read a verse individually and in its own context. We cannot assume that every instance of every construct will be used the same, or misinterpretation will result. For example, there are at least three different meanings for the word translated \"star\" in the Book of Revelation alone (angels, meteors\/\"shooting stars\", and literal stars)! In fact, the use of similar constructs for different purposes seems to be one of the ways that God made the Bible tricky on purpose as Isaiah and Jesus declared about God's word (Isa 6:9-10; Mk 4:11; Mt 13:11; Lk 8:10; 10:21-24). Why Only a Literal Mark Works Whenever you are in doubt after carefully considering a verse in context, you can usually resolve it by looking at related passages or in other words by looking at it in the greater Biblical context. Revelation 14:9 is another passage dealing with the Mark of the Beast which we can consult for help. Using it, we can dispel any doubt about the literal meaning of the Mark of the Beast. This passage is the third of three angel's warnings delivered to mankind. This third message specifically warns everyone about the grave consequences of receiving the Mark of the Beast in the \"forehead\" or \"hand:\" Revelation 14:9-10 (HCSB) \u2014 9 And a third angel followed them and spoke with a loud voice: \" If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand ...10... he will also drink the wine of God\u2019s wrath , He will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the sight of the holy angels Now think about the theory of a figurative mark in the context of this dire warning. The unsuspecting general public is going to be given this warning so that they are able to know what to do to avoid God's wrath, a very serious thing indeed. They will need simple clear understandable instructions that they can act on. But a message referencing a forbidden figurative mark is not clear but requires further explanation or thought before people can know what it is they must avoid. This would leave people uncertain and unable to follow the instructions. If the warning tells you to reject any future leader who wants to put a literal mark on your skin (forehead or right hand), that's very understandable and actionable. If it's figurative, where the mark can be anything like keeping Sunday vs. Sabbath, how would you be sure? Since a figurative mark does not work in the warning here, then why did God use figurative language to \"warn\" Israel about keeping Torah in their thoughts and deeds? It worked for that because that earlier hand\/forehead sign referenced something that he had already told them volumes about: the Torah. He wanted to communicate to them how integral they needed to make Torah to their life and he did so using a powerful metaphorical illustration. In contrast, the Mark of the Beast warning is a stand-alone command to the general public to whom God has only spoken two other messages ever in total. Metaphorical language does not get the job done. The warning about receiving a \"mark in the head or hand\" can only refer to a literal marking on the forehead or hand which people can readily understand, identify, and know what to do when they encounter it. But Wait...If There Will Be a Universal Warning, Why Won't Everyone Just Listen and Avoid the Mark? With that question settled by the third angel worldwide warning text, another question is raised. If the warning about the mark is going to be as global and clear as stated above, then why will anyone get trapped into taking the mark? This is a simple question with a not-so-simple answer. It requires knowing several aspects of the end times in order to understand it. To help with that, let me outline the distinct categories people will fall into when the mark is out: 3 Categories of People When the Mark Comes Mark accepters (alive, but destined for God's wrath) Mark rejecters\/martyrs (dead or soon-to-be-dead(see below) but destined for the First Resurrection) Mark evaders (alive and destined for the rapture) The first two categories are obvious and self-explanatory, but the last one, of mark evader, requires explanation. The mark evaders are obviously similar to the mark rejecters in wanting to heed the universal warning about not taking the mark. However, they differ from the mark rejecters in the two aspects of proactivity and of faith. We shall see that to evade the mark is not as simple or foolproof as it may seem to you now. Faith Needed To Obey the Warning By way of illustration, you could compare it to the challenge of getting a girl to evade teen pregnancy by giving her a warning about it when she is ten years old. She may agree at that age that teen pregnancy is a bad outcome which she does not want. Yet, after she passes puberty, certain temptations must be resisted or certain actions be taken for the teen pregnancy warning to work out well. Similarly, when you hear the warning about the mark, you must take a specific action before the mark even arrives. If you do not do so, it will be too late and you will get pregnant, as the analogy goes, or be left with choices 1 and 2 above only. That's the proactive aspect of evading the mark. The faith aspect of evading the mark comes in because the action required to avoid the mark will be to \"come out of Babylon\" (Rev 18:4; Jer 50:8; 51:6, 9, 45). The end-time prophecies of the Bible repeatedly speak of God leading his faithful servants out of their home countries to a place he prepares to feed them during the Great Tribulation (Rev 12:12-17). However, it will not be so clear that this is right to do, as it is to, say, exit a burning house when someone shouts \"Fire! Get out!\" Probably everything in the world will look as fine (if you can call it that) as it does today. It will be counter-intuitive. It has been my experience that when this clear (future) travel prophecy from the Bible is shared with normal church-going Christians, they reflexively reject it. It sounds ridiculous to the average Christian that God would ever require his people to do something so radical as to leave their homes. Many of them miss the obvious irony in their objection to a future God-given travel command in light of the fact that God has done this very thing repeatedly in the past with his faithful servants as the OT records. He told Abraham to leave his country. Lot had to leave Sodom. He told the entire nation of Israel to leave Egypt. Sure, they were slaves there anyway, but there are many parallels to their literal slavery and our modern slavery to sin, addictions, distractions, etc. in our home countries that an end-time exodus would release us from, too. (Note: A major reason that many despair upon hearing about needing to move to escape the end times, is that, again, they are not remembering the lessons of the Exodus. When God commanded Israel to leave Egypt, he did not abandon them but gave them tremendous \"provision to go along with the commission\" as the saying goes. They had great leadership, divine protection, payment of back wages through spoiling of the Egyptians and miracles such as the Red Sea crossing, shoes not wearing out, healings, manna from heaven to feed them, water from the rock to drink, victory over their enemies, etc. We can expect the same thing again when God again commands his servants to march out. Passports, money, illnesses unwilling spouses, and children will all be worked out (cf Ex 19:4 = Rev 12:14). Hope this helps) No Visible Angels Another reason that faith will tie in greatly is that most likely, the instructions of the three angels will be spoken to people not by the three angels themselves, but by humans; prophets. This probably sounds ridiculous at first but if you read the passage carefully you'll note that it never quite says that the angels themselves do the preaching of their own messages (Rev 14:6). It simply says they \"have\" the messages to be preached. This leaves room for someone else to do the preaching. This phrasing is good because it does not make the passage break with precedent for how angels are tasked by God in the Bible. Angels usually interface only with the righteous or small groups of the public. When God deals with the general public or nations, he uses men exclusively. I think the answer to which men it will be this time is found, by no coincidence, in the verses immediately preceding (Rev 14:1-5). If you ever wondered who the 144,000 are and why they are given such special protection so that the Beast's forces cannot touch them, this would answer that. Their message of warning must go out without encumbrance to counteract the powerful dragnet that the Beast will be allowed to unleash on humanity. However, like all prophets before them, they are mere men and not as fearsome and compelling as an angel of light speaking before your eyes. People will be able to doubt and ignore the warnings and call to action of the 144,000 men. \"My pastor said not to go\" It should not be hard for the reader to imagine how most Christians will scoff at even a real miracle-working Bible-conforming prophet sent by God telling people to \"come out of Babylon\" per the prophecies. Christians by nature rely on their pastors and other Christians to tell them what is right or what to do. They sincerely believe \"all these churches can't be wrong.\" Thus, when most churches advise people to ignore the crazy prophet message to leave and just stay \"safe in Jesus\" where they are and\/or await the \"pretrib rapture,\" it will be largely followed. They will not have the faith or guts to obey the command to leave early enough in order to avoid the mark. Then, when they actually see the Abomination of Desolation (military takeover of Jerusalem and the Temple by the Antichrist) that they were warned would come, they will want to obey the \"crazy\" instructions they ignored years before. However, if they are not close to the location that God told them to move to, there will be no chance of them making it there in time before the Great Tribulation begins (30 days later). The mark edict will soon be issued and they will be faced with the tough choice of option 1 or option 2. Option 3, of mark evasion, will have expired. Why It's Not Already Here You may have noticed that this article so far has not even touched on what most articles about this topic center on: speculation about which technology today is the Mark of the Beast. This is what is called \"newspaper exegesis,\" the popular practice of trying to interpret prophecy by the current events. As already covered, the mark does not come until the Antichrist rises after we leave. It's that simple. That said, it would not hurt for me to share some other reasons why things popularly pushed as the mark cannot be it. Because, if you had not noticed, practically every popular new consumer technology ever invented, whether it be barcodes, credit cards, bio-chips, and RFID, have at one point been proposed as \"mark technology\" or a sign that the mark and Antichrist are near. Of course, after those technologies become prominent, ubiquitous and prove harmless and the Antichrist \"delays his coming\" (Lk 12:45) nobody remembers the speculation and people move on to newer technology. \"COVID Vaccines\/Passports Are the Mark!\" Along those lines, these days the latest theory is that the COVID vaccines or passports are the mark or a \"precursor.\" Again, precursors don't count. But here's why COVID does not fit: People say COVID passports stop you from buying and selling if you don't submit to get the vaccine. But you can still buy anything online and most everything offline like groceries. You may also have to change jobs. When you don't have the mark, you can buy or sell nothing. You starve. Quite different! More importantly, the mark is first and foremost about submitting to worship of the Beast as God; not about the ability to trade, which is a benefit to that worship. Vaccines have no such component of a person you must worship as God. The mark is put on the skin of the forehead or hand (Rev 20:4). Vaccines are injected under the skin typically in the shoulder and are not at all an identifying mark related to the beast's name or 666. So you see, the only way to make a vaccine or its passport fit the mark of the beast is to ignore the most important characteristic of the mark. That's not good exegesis. A theory for the mark must fit all the details given on it, not just one. What Do I Think the Mark Is? Then what is my pick for the mark? In short, it's something we have not seen yet because the power of the mark is beyond our comprehension today. I say that because when you consider the Mark of the Beast verse, it's not so simple as people understand it, such as a cashless society. Rev 13:17 \u2014 so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark: the beast\u2019s name or the number of his name. Considering that verse you can rule out a few things right off: The mark is not mainly a currency: It always seemed odd to me that the mark was needed for selling, not just buying. If the mark were simply a new currency that everyone must adopt, there is no need to mention \"selling.\" You don't need currency to sell; you only need currency to buy as the seller receives currency from the buyer. (That's another reason why Bitcoin\/cryptocurrency does not fit the mark.). So I rule out \"only currency\" off of that. It always seemed odd to me that the mark was needed for selling, not just buying. If the mark were simply a new currency that everyone must adopt, there is no need to mention \"selling.\" You don't need currency to sell; you only need currency to buy as the seller receives currency from the buyer. (That's another reason why Bitcoin\/cryptocurrency does not fit the mark.). So I rule out \"only currency\" off of that. The mark is not (only) identification : I've used to think of the mark as an identification required to do (digital) commerce. Much like how a credit card number is needed for online purchases. Cash only works in person; you can't slide it into your PC or phone to buy something online. In fact, you could say \"no one can buy or sell [on the internet] unless he has a credit\/debit card.\" : I've used to think of the mark as an identification required to do (digital) commerce. Much like how a credit card number is needed for online purchases. Cash only works in person; you can't slide it into your PC or phone to buy something online. In fact, you could say \"no one can buy or sell [on the internet] unless he has a credit\/debit card.\" Is trade\/bartering stopped, too?: What I also ask myself is can you get away with trade and bartering without the mark? If the mark is only an ID\/currency account, then I doubt trade\/bartering by people without the mark can be stopped. How powerful is it then and why mention its part in (some) economic transactions? I tend to think that the power policing and enforcing the mark will make it absolutely required to buy or sell anything just as the simple words imply. If it's that powerful then a simple digital technology like a chip does not really do it justice. What I also ask myself is can you get away with trade and bartering without the mark?

If it's that powerful then a simple digital technology like a chip does not really do it justice. Beast UBI? With the talk these days \"universal basic income\" (UBI) or a default minimal income for all citizens from the government, I wonder if the mark won't tie into something like that. Given the world will be devastated for the Antichrist to come to power, a UBI might be needed for people to survive while the economy rebuilds using the supernatural\/nephilim help of the Antichrist. Perhaps the mark will be tied to your UBI (Univeral Beast Income) and the currency it is issued in and the account you depend on for any commerce. All that to say, when I consider the buying\/selling power of the mark and the power of the Beast behind it, I lean towards the mark being like nothing we have seen today. To compare it to optional, voluntary, technologies like credit cards, chips, RFIDs, and the like, to me, vastly underestimates what Revelation is trying to convey about the mark and its necessity to commerce under the Beast. What To Do Today To Escape the Mark Clearly, every believer prefers to avoid ending up in that no-win situation of having to choose between martyrdom and markdom. We all want choice 3: neither! To have that option, the challenge at that point of no return will be in having the discernment to recognize which way God is leading; \"should I stay or should I go?\" Even if you do recognize the truth spoken by God's prophets on leaving, you will also need the faith to go ahead with the minority in following such radical and hard instructions. The question, then, is how do we develop the faith and boldness needed to take the hard early action required to avoid the mark? Jesus gave us the clearest advice I know: Luke 18:8 (HCSB)\u2014 I tell you that He will swiftly grant them justice. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find that faith on earth ? Luke 17:5-6 (HCSB) \u2014 5 The apostles said to the Lord, \u201c Increase our faith .\u201d 6 \u201cIf you have faith the size of a mustard seed,\u201d the Lord said, \u201cyou can say to this mulberry tree, \u2018Be uprooted and planted in the sea,\u2019 and it will obey you. Luke 21:36 (ESV) \u2014 But stay awake at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.\u201d Ever notice that nowhere in the Gospels can you find Jesus directly answering the question of how one increases their faith? I was frustrated at that for a while when I was wanting more faith, like the apostles. Finally, I realized that the Bible gives us the answer elsewhere and everywhere. In the many stories of the Bible, we see God's servants walking prayerfully with him through hardships and learning several things in the process. They learn how to recognize his hand leading. This normally does not consist of voices, dreams, and visions, but of coincidences or \"God-incidences\" or \"open doors\" (Rev 3:8, 20) and \"closed doors\" (Rev 3:7). They learn what he is likely to do or lead us to do and what he is not likely to do nor lead us to do. They learn how to trust him when the situation looks like he has abandoned them and just wait in patience and peace until the clear direction to act comes if any action is required. In other words, they learn faith and how to act on it. If you pray daily about having faith and strength as Jesus instructed, then you can be sure that God will hear that prayer according to his will. In response, he will direct you just as he did the servants in the Bible who wanted the same thing. You will be put in sometimes uncomfortable situations like they were which require you to be bold and radical at times, and to be inactive or meek at other times; the whole gamut. This will prepare you for all situations including the coming crisis of decision over leaving your home country early enough to escape the Mark of the Beast. By the way, as far as finances and other logistics, when the time to escape comes, God has a plan to give provision to all those who choose in faith to obey the command to escape. See my article on the faith to escape to understand that situation. What Not To Do... Lastly, a warning: Emigration to Israel for non-Jews is generally not possible today. The way must be opened up, not just for our move, but several end-time events also require a major change in Israel. For example, the construction of the Third Temple or the sealing of the 144,000 on the Temple Mount can't happen today without Arab control of the Temple Mount being eradicated. I expect the prophesied M.E. nuclear war against Israel where Damascus is laid waste to bring that about. Conclusion The Mark of the Beast is going to be far more irresistible than most Christians can imagine. But the solution to its challenge is not to get distracted today by trying to figure out exactly what it is in advance. Even if you did figure that out, it would do you no good. If you see the mark, it will already be too late to escape it with your life intact. The proper escape plan will instead require faith and proactive, radical action. Unfortunately, as Jesus insinuated, faith will be a rare trait in the end times (Lk 18:8). Further, you do not learn bold and radical action by just going to church every Sunday and listening to your pastor. The answer is to follow Jesus' advice to stay awake and to pray daily for \"the strength to escape what is coming\" (Lk 21:36). God will be sure to answer that prayer by guiding your life so that you get the experiences and information which will develop the faith and radical streak you will need when the time comes. What's more, these two things will help you to serve God and shine your light even better every day along the way, just like the faithful maverick Jesus did.

        "link":"https:\/\/escapeallthesethings.com\/mark-of-the-beast\/",
        "text":"The Book of Revelation may be a confusing book overall, but it is crystal clear on \"don't take the Mark of the Beast\" (Rev 14:9). Yet how do you obey that? Can they force the mark on you or trick you into taking it? Find out everything you need to know about the Mark of the Beast today\u2014plus a startling new insight on the months of torture awaiting those who take action too late. If the Antichrist is the most dreaded threat of the Book of Revelation, then his mark would have to be a close second. Just as people wonder who might be the Antichrist today, they also wonder whether the Mark of the Beast is already here, such as in the COVID vaccines or passports. As a result, the following passage from Revelation about the Mark of the Beast is one of the most quoted passages in the Bible: The Mark of the Beast Passage Revelation 13:16-18 (HCSB) \u2014 16 And he [the False Prophet] requires everyone \u2014small and great, rich and poor, free and slave\u2014 to be given a mark on his right hand or on his forehead , 17 so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark : the beast\u2019s name or the number of his name. 18 Here is wisdom:, The one who has understanding must calculate the number of the beast, because it is the number of a man. His number is 666. This passage is talking about the Great Tribulation (Mt 24:21) or the time when the Antichrist (or first Beast of Revelation 13) rules the entire earth. The second beast of Revelation 13, also called the False Prophet (Rev 16:13; 19:20; 20:10), will put in place a system of total control. They will attempt to brand every human with a mark that is needed for commerce. Obviously, without being able to buy or sell anything, you are not going to function in society or last long. It's very important to note two things that everyone seems to ignore: the mark cannot be here until the Antichrist and False Prophet rule. Most mark theorists overlook that. Not A Warning to Bible Readers! (New Insight) More importantly, everyone misses that this passage is not a warning to us, the readers about the mark. It is a prophecy of a warning being proclaimed to the entire world at the start of the Great Tribulation! It goes out because the mark is then present. The warning prophecy gives readers a concept of what it will be like, but not enough detail to figure out exactly what it will be in advance; yet there's no need to, right? When it is here, then the warning will go out. Also, there will be no need for more \"clues\" to identify it as it will be made plainly clear that the mark is what the False Prophet is pushing on people. See how different that is from speculating about what it is today? You see then, there is no need to worry about the mark being here today nor any pressure to identify it now. You can't take it, and \"precursors\" (if such a thing were to exist) don't count! Despite the negatives to refusing the mark, it's plain from another passage that you do have the freewill choice to do that: Revelation 20:4 (HCSB) \u2014 Then I saw thrones, and people seated on them who were given authority to judge. I also saw the people, who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of God\u2019s word, who had not worshiped the beast or his gf image, and who had not accepted the mark on their foreheads or their hands . This passage should reassure those who worry that they can be tricked into taking the mark or forced to take it without their permission. It seems that the False Prophet will need your permission. Otherwise, there would be nobody who \"had not accepted the mark.\" The bad news is that they will not accept your response of \"no, thank you\" kindly. They will try to persuade all people to take the mark through at least four separate pressures or methods of persuasion. Click here to jump to the update on Covid in prophecy Four Powerful Pressures For Taking the Mark The first pressure is what Paul calls the strong delusion (2Th 2:11). The Antichrist will actually succeed in pawning himself off as God on earth ruling from the Third Temple in Jerusalem (2Th 2:4). Jesus said that this deception would be so convincing that even the \"very elect\" would be taken by it if it were possible. Thankfully, it's not possible because God intervenes with the Two Witnesses and 144,000 to preach the truth as an alternative to the popular lie (Mt 24:24). Despite God's counter-programming, the vast majority of the people are going to be convinced that the Antichrist is indeed God. This is due to the convincing signs performed at the hand of the False Prophet. These include calling fire down from heaven and making the image (statue) of the Beast that speaks (Rev 13:13-15). The second pressure takes care of the minority of defiant skeptics who do not fall for the strong delusion. It appears from the passage above that the False Prophet will command death for those who refuse the mark. This is just as he does to those who refuse to worship the image\/statue of the beast (Rev 13:15 = Rev 20:4). Many Christians will have read their Bibles or heard and believed the warning of the mark, but they simply are not martyr-material. They will crumble under the pressure. As Jesus said, the love of believers will wax cold and believers will betray each other to save their own skin (Mt 24:12, 10). Understanding the third and fourth pressures requires a correct understanding of the prophetic roadmap and especially where the Great Tribulation fits in it. Most believe or have been taught that the Great Tribulation begins at the 1st seal. While the white horseman does indeed seem to fit the Antichrist, that's an incorrect conclusion; it actually refers to what Jesus said about the many (religions) that would come in his name, talk about him, and deceive many (Mt 24:5). The real match for the rise of Antichrist and the start of the Great Tribulation is the 5th trumpet. When someone shows you the proof of how the Great Tribulation starts when Satan is cast out of heaven (he has not been cast out yet) as the start of three \"woes,\" the Great Tribulation \/ 5th trumpet connection becomes pretty self-evident (cf. Dan 12:1=Rev 12:7-17=Mt 24:15,21=Rev 9:1-6, 11-13). Once you get that crucial point correct, it opens up the possibility of seeing a couple of other key insights. First, obviously, the 5th Trumpet follows the 4th Trumpet. The 4th Trumpet concludes the sequence of severe global catastrophes on earth caused by near-earth objects (such as Star Wormwood) starting at the 6th seal. This will leave the world in a state of devastation (Rev 6:14; 8:7, 9), fear, panic, chaos (Rev 6:15-16), dark , cold (Rev 8:12), smoke, fires (Rev 8:8-9), water scarcity (Rev 8:10-11) and famine (Rev 8:7, 9, 12). Second, this answers how the Antichrist comes to power. It provides the perfect scenario for the Antichrist as the would-be God and \"Savior of the world\" to appear as the only solution to so many problems\u2014including the severe food shortage. Probably the mark will be presented as part of his plan to solve both the security (identification) and shortages of basic necessities (rationing). (Americans saw a similar thing after the 9-11 attack with the push for a national ID called Real ID.) Thus, the third pressure would be that, given the clear scarcity of food and clean water prior to the rise of the Beast, you will not get your basic living needs met without accepting the mark. The threat of death from thirst and starvation will already be mounting by the time the mark is presented to offer relief. If you do not take it, death will be knocking at the door. Principles and skepticism go out the window in such extreme situations. But there are always stubborn, crafty, and prepared people who would still refuse the mark and scratch out an existence \"off the grid.\" There is apparently another, fourth pressure that will take care of even them. At the 5th Trumpet, we are told that an army of deadly scorpion-like locusts with teeth and stingers are released from imprisonment in the Abyss (Rev 9:1-3). Although lethal-looking (Rev 9:7-9), they do not go out to kill people; they only go out to torture everyone except the 144,000 and the other gathered-protected servants of God (Rev 9:4-5; 7:3-4; 12:13-17). It actually says people will seek death but be unable to find it (Rev 9:6). These demonic creatures will be able to search out every nook and cranny where survivalists and other resistors with stashes of food and ammunition are hiding (Joel 2:9). Their fortification, walls, and weapons will not protect them from the locusts (Joel 2:9). The torture will no doubt be very effective in getting them to accept the mark. Refuse the Mark = 5 Months of Painful Torture The passage telling us that these tortured people \"will seek death and not find it\" during the five months seems like a contradiction with what we said above that the False Prophet will cause those refusing the mark to be killed. But if you think it through carefully, you'll see there is a resolution. It points to a terrifying new realization about the mark that you probably never heard of before: Refusing the mark is not rewarded instantly with death. On the contrary, it is rewarded first with up to five months of torture to persuade you to accept the mark. At the end of the five months of the locusts' torture tour, they finally will put you to death. Why the delay? They may be sadists or they may simply prefer to have Beast kingdom subjects than dead defeated martyrs. (Note, that the locusts passage does not say all people besides God's sealed are tortured. It just says the power is there to do so. Since it makes no sense for the new Antichrist \"God\" to make his first order of business the torture of his admiring subjects, even those who accept him as \"God,\" I think it's a fair deduction that the power to torture is not used on those who take the mark. If he really wanted to capture, mark and torture everyone, then why stop after five months? But if the torture is to force the mark, then it makes sense that the torture is only used for a short time in the beginning. It only takes a few months to find and capture every single living human on earth who is trying to avoid the mark and to try to convince them to change their mind.) Article continues below... The End In 2026? It's Now Possible Since learning in 2001 that Yeshua must return in a Sabbath year, I've had to rule out three Sabbath year cycle windows for the final 7 years (2003-2009, 2010-2016, 2017-2023). With the next window (2024-2030) less than 7 years away, I'm ready to share why I believe, based on the real end time sign of Mt 24:14, that this can be the one. If it is, the \"birth pains\" (WW3 + Wormwood, Lk 21:10-11) would hit near its middle in 2026 with Yeshua returning in 2030. Find out what's changed to convince me about 2026 and what you can do about it... In summary, then, here are the four pressures on people that will make most people accept the mark: The 4 Reasons Why Most People Will Take the Mark Convinced Antichrist is God on earth To avoid beheading To avoid starvation To avoid (up to) five months of torture \"Mark\" Only Figurative? Or Literal? Terrifying, isn't it? Anyone understanding just a fraction of the pressures coming to push the mark on people will naturally want to know exactly what it is now so they can be sure to see it coming. Actually, we'll see later why it is that if you want to successfully avoid it (and keep your life), you must never see it. Yet people still persist in wanting to know what it is now. The first question, then, is to ask is what is the intended meaning of the passage describing the mark? Should we read it literally, as a visible marking on the skin of the hand or forehead or figuratively as something completely different (such as, say, \"Sabbath-breaking\/Sunday worship\" like the Seventh Day Adventists and others believe)? A big reason for doubt about the interpretation of the mark passage comes from an uncannily similar instruction to ancient Israel recorded in the Torah about a sign\/symbol in their forehead and hand (Ex 13:9, 16; Dt 6:8; 11:18): Exodus 13:16 (HCSB) \u2014 So let it be a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead , for the LORD brought us out of Egypt by the strength of His hand. Orthodox Judaism uses this command to justify their tradition of binding \"phylacteries\" to the forehead and hands. However, most agree that ancient Israel did not follow this verse the way modern Judaism does. Instead, they understood it figuratively as telling them to keep the Torah firmly in mind (\"forehead\") and in their actions (the \"hand\"). If you agree with this interpretation, then it's natural to read the very similar passage in Revelation exactly the same way: figuratively (especially in a book like Revelation that is already assumed to be mostly symbolically figurative). But we have to decide how to read a verse individually and in its own context. We cannot assume that every instance of every construct will be used the same, or misinterpretation will result. For example, there are at least three different meanings for the word translated \"star\" in the Book of Revelation alone (angels, meteors\/\"shooting stars\", and literal stars)! In fact, the use of similar constructs for different purposes seems to be one of the ways that God made the Bible tricky on purpose as Isaiah and Jesus declared about God's word (Isa 6:9-10; Mk 4:11; Mt 13:11; Lk 8:10; 10:21-24). Why Only a Literal Mark Works Whenever you are in doubt after carefully considering a verse in context, you can usually resolve it by looking at related passages or in other words by looking at it in the greater Biblical context. Revelation 14:9 is another passage dealing with the Mark of the Beast which we can consult for help. Using it, we can dispel any doubt about the literal meaning of the Mark of the Beast. This passage is the third of three angel's warnings delivered to mankind. This third message specifically warns everyone about the grave consequences of receiving the Mark of the Beast in the \"forehead\" or \"hand:\" Revelation 14:9-10 (HCSB) \u2014 9 And a third angel followed them and spoke with a loud voice: \" If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand ...10... he will also drink the wine of God\u2019s wrath , He will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the sight of the holy angels Now think about the theory of a figurative mark in the context of this dire warning. The unsuspecting general public is going to be given this warning so that they are able to know what to do to avoid God's wrath, a very serious thing indeed. They will need simple clear understandable instructions that they can act on. But a message referencing a forbidden figurative mark is not clear but requires further explanation or thought before people can know what it is they must avoid. This would leave people uncertain and unable to follow the instructions. If the warning tells you to reject any future leader who wants to put a literal mark on your skin (forehead or right hand), that's very understandable and actionable. If it's figurative, where the mark can be anything like keeping Sunday vs. Sabbath, how would you be sure? Since a figurative mark does not work in the warning here, then why did God use figurative language to \"warn\" Israel about keeping Torah in their thoughts and deeds? It worked for that because that earlier hand\/forehead sign referenced something that he had already told them volumes about: the Torah. He wanted to communicate to them how integral they needed to make Torah to their life and he did so using a powerful metaphorical illustration. In contrast, the Mark of the Beast warning is a stand-alone command to the general public to whom God has only spoken two other messages ever in total. Metaphorical language does not get the job done. The warning about receiving a \"mark in the head or hand\" can only refer to a literal marking on the forehead or hand which people can readily understand, identify, and know what to do when they encounter it. But Wait...If There Will Be a Universal Warning, Why Won't Everyone Just Listen and Avoid the Mark? With that question settled by the third angel worldwide warning text, another question is raised. If the warning about the mark is going to be as global and clear as stated above, then why will anyone get trapped into taking the mark? This is a simple question with a not-so-simple answer. It requires knowing several aspects of the end times in order to understand it. To help with that, let me outline the distinct categories people will fall into when the mark is out: 3 Categories of People When the Mark Comes Mark accepters (alive, but destined for God's wrath) Mark rejecters\/martyrs (dead or soon-to-be-dead(see below) but destined for the First Resurrection) Mark evaders (alive and destined for the rapture) The first two categories are obvious and self-explanatory, but the last one, of mark evader, requires explanation. The mark evaders are obviously similar to the mark rejecters in wanting to heed the universal warning about not taking the mark. However, they differ from the mark rejecters in the two aspects of proactivity and of faith. We shall see that to evade the mark is not as simple or foolproof as it may seem to you now. Faith Needed To Obey the Warning By way of illustration, you could compare it to the challenge of getting a girl to evade teen pregnancy by giving her a warning about it when she is ten years old. She may agree at that age that teen pregnancy is a bad outcome which she does not want. Yet, after she passes puberty, certain temptations must be resisted or certain actions be taken for the teen pregnancy warning to work out well. Similarly, when you hear the warning about the mark, you must take a specific action before the mark even arrives. If you do not do so, it will be too late and you will get pregnant, as the analogy goes, or be left with choices 1 and 2 above only. That's the proactive aspect of evading the mark. The faith aspect of evading the mark comes in because the action required to avoid the mark will be to \"come out of Babylon\" (Rev 18:4; Jer 50:8; 51:6, 9, 45). The end-time prophecies of the Bible repeatedly speak of God leading his faithful servants out of their home countries to a place he prepares to feed them during the Great Tribulation (Rev 12:12-17). However, it will not be so clear that this is right to do, as it is to, say, exit a burning house when someone shouts \"Fire! Get out!\" Probably everything in the world will look as fine (if you can call it that) as it does today. It will be counter-intuitive. It has been my experience that when this clear (future) travel prophecy from the Bible is shared with normal church-going Christians, they reflexively reject it. It sounds ridiculous to the average Christian that God would ever require his people to do something so radical as to leave their homes. Many of them miss the obvious irony in their objection to a future God-given travel command in light of the fact that God has done this very thing repeatedly in the past with his faithful servants as the OT records. He told Abraham to leave his country. Lot had to leave Sodom. He told the entire nation of Israel to leave Egypt. Sure, they were slaves there anyway, but there are many parallels to their literal slavery and our modern slavery to sin, addictions, distractions, etc. in our home countries that an end-time exodus would release us from, too. (Note: A major reason that many despair upon hearing about needing to move to escape the end times, is that, again, they are not remembering the lessons of the Exodus. When God commanded Israel to leave Egypt, he did not abandon them but gave them tremendous \"provision to go along with the commission\" as the saying goes. They had great leadership, divine protection, payment of back wages through spoiling of the Egyptians and miracles such as the Red Sea crossing, shoes not wearing out, healings, manna from heaven to feed them, water from the rock to drink, victory over their enemies, etc. We can expect the same thing again when God again commands his servants to march out. Passports, money, illnesses unwilling spouses, and children will all be worked out (cf Ex 19:4 = Rev 12:14). Hope this helps) No Visible Angels Another reason that faith will tie in greatly is that most likely, the instructions of the three angels will be spoken to people not by the three angels themselves, but by humans; prophets. This probably sounds ridiculous at first but if you read the passage carefully you'll note that it never quite says that the angels themselves do the preaching of their own messages (Rev 14:6). It simply says they \"have\" the messages to be preached. This leaves room for someone else to do the preaching. This phrasing is good because it does not make the passage break with precedent for how angels are tasked by God in the Bible. Angels usually interface only with the righteous or small groups of the public. When God deals with the general public or nations, he uses men exclusively. I think the answer to which men it will be this time is found, by no coincidence, in the verses immediately preceding (Rev 14:1-5). If you ever wondered who the 144,000 are and why they are given such special protection so that the Beast's forces cannot touch them, this would answer that. Their message of warning must go out without encumbrance to counteract the powerful dragnet that the Beast will be allowed to unleash on humanity. However, like all prophets before them, they are mere men and not as fearsome and compelling as an angel of light speaking before your eyes. People will be able to doubt and ignore the warnings and call to action of the 144,000 men. \"My pastor said not to go\" It should not be hard for the reader to imagine how most Christians will scoff at even a real miracle-working Bible-conforming prophet sent by God telling people to \"come out of Babylon\" per the prophecies. Christians by nature rely on their pastors and other Christians to tell them what is right or what to do. They sincerely believe \"all these churches can't be wrong.\" Thus, when most churches advise people to ignore the crazy prophet message to leave and just stay \"safe in Jesus\" where they are and\/or await the \"pretrib rapture,\" it will be largely followed. They will not have the faith or guts to obey the command to leave early enough in order to avoid the mark. Then, when they actually see the Abomination of Desolation (military takeover of Jerusalem and the Temple by the Antichrist) that they were warned would come, they will want to obey the \"crazy\" instructions they ignored years before. However, if they are not close to the location that God told them to move to, there will be no chance of them making it there in time before the Great Tribulation begins (30 days later). The mark edict will soon be issued and they will be faced with the tough choice of option 1 or option 2. Option 3, of mark evasion, will have expired. Why It's Not Already Here You may have noticed that this article so far has not even touched on what most articles about this topic center on: speculation about which technology today is the Mark of the Beast. This is what is called \"newspaper exegesis,\" the popular practice of trying to interpret prophecy by the current events. As already covered, the mark does not come until the Antichrist rises after we leave. It's that simple. That said, it would not hurt for me to share some other reasons why things popularly pushed as the mark cannot be it. Because, if you had not noticed, practically every popular new consumer technology ever invented, whether it be barcodes, credit cards, bio-chips, and RFID, have at one point been proposed as \"mark technology\" or a sign that the mark and Antichrist are near. Of course, after those technologies become prominent, ubiquitous and prove harmless and the Antichrist \"delays his coming\" (Lk 12:45) nobody remembers the speculation and people move on to newer technology. \"COVID Vaccines\/Passports Are the Mark!\" Along those lines, these days the latest theory is that the COVID vaccines or passports are the mark or a \"precursor.\" Again, precursors don't count. But here's why COVID does not fit: People say COVID passports stop you from buying and selling if you don't submit to get the vaccine. But you can still buy anything online and most everything offline like groceries. You may also have to change jobs. When you don't have the mark, you can buy or sell nothing. You starve. Quite different! More importantly, the mark is first and foremost about submitting to worship of the Beast as God; not about the ability to trade, which is a benefit to that worship. Vaccines have no such component of a person you must worship as God. The mark is put on the skin of the forehead or hand (Rev 20:4). Vaccines are injected under the skin typically in the shoulder and are not at all an identifying mark related to the beast's name or 666. So you see, the only way to make a vaccine or its passport fit the mark of the beast is to ignore the most important characteristic of the mark. That's not good exegesis. A theory for the mark must fit all the details given on it, not just one. What Do I Think the Mark Is? Then what is my pick for the mark? In short, it's something we have not seen yet because the power of the mark is beyond our comprehension today. I say that because when you consider the Mark of the Beast verse, it's not so simple as people understand it, such as a cashless society. Rev 13:17 \u2014 so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark: the beast\u2019s name or the number of his name. Considering that verse you can rule out a few things right off: The mark is not mainly a currency: It always seemed odd to me that the mark was needed for selling, not just buying. If the mark were simply a new currency that everyone must adopt, there is no need to mention \"selling.\" You don't need currency to sell; you only need currency to buy as the seller receives currency from the buyer. (That's another reason why Bitcoin\/cryptocurrency does not fit the mark.). So I rule out \"only currency\" off of that. It always seemed odd to me that the mark was needed for selling, not just buying. If the mark were simply a new currency that everyone must adopt, there is no need to mention \"selling.\" You don't need currency to sell; you only need currency to buy as the seller receives currency from the buyer. (That's another reason why Bitcoin\/cryptocurrency does not fit the mark.). So I rule out \"only currency\" off of that. The mark is not (only) identification : I've used to think of the mark as an identification required to do (digital) commerce. Much like how a credit card number is needed for online purchases. Cash only works in person; you can't slide it into your PC or phone to buy something online. In fact, you could say \"no one can buy or sell [on the internet] unless he has a credit\/debit card.\" : I've used to think of the mark as an identification required to do (digital) commerce. Much like how a credit card number is needed for online purchases. Cash only works in person; you can't slide it into your PC or phone to buy something online. In fact, you could say \"no one can buy or sell [on the internet] unless he has a credit\/debit card.\" Is trade\/bartering stopped, too?: What I also ask myself is can you get away with trade and bartering without the mark? If the mark is only an ID\/currency account, then I doubt trade\/bartering by people without the mark can be stopped. How powerful is it then and why mention its part in (some) economic transactions? I tend to think that the power policing and enforcing the mark will make it absolutely required to buy or sell anything just as the simple words imply. If it's that powerful then a simple digital technology like a chip does not really do it justice. What I also ask myself is can you get away with trade and bartering without the mark?

I tend to think that the power policing and enforcing the mark will make it absolutely required to buy or sell anything just as the simple words imply. If it's that powerful then a simple digital technology like a chip does not really do it justice. Beast UBI? With the talk these days \"universal basic income\" (UBI) or a default minimal income for all citizens from the government, I wonder if the mark won't tie into something like that. Given the world will be devastated for the Antichrist to come to power, a UBI might be needed for people to survive while the economy rebuilds using the supernatural\/nephilim help of the Antichrist. Perhaps the mark will be tied to your UBI (Univeral Beast Income) and the currency it is issued in and the account you depend on for any commerce. All that to say, when I consider the buying\/selling power of the mark and the power of the Beast behind it, I lean towards the mark being like nothing we have seen today. To compare it to optional, voluntary, technologies like credit cards, chips, RFIDs, and the like, to me, vastly underestimates what Revelation is trying to convey about the mark and its necessity to commerce under the Beast. What To Do Today To Escape the Mark Clearly, every believer prefers to avoid ending up in that no-win situation of having to choose between martyrdom and markdom. We all want choice 3: neither! To have that option, the challenge at that point of no return will be in having the discernment to recognize which way God is leading; \"should I stay or should I go?\" Even if you do recognize the truth spoken by God's prophets on leaving, you will also need the faith to go ahead with the minority in following such radical and hard instructions. The question, then, is how do we develop the faith and boldness needed to take the hard early action required to avoid the mark? Jesus gave us the clearest advice I know: Luke 18:8 (HCSB)\u2014 I tell you that He will swiftly grant them justice. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find that faith on earth ? Luke 17:5-6 (HCSB) \u2014 5 The apostles said to the Lord, \u201c Increase our faith .\u201d 6 \u201cIf you have faith the size of a mustard seed,\u201d the Lord said, \u201cyou can say to this mulberry tree, \u2018Be uprooted and planted in the sea,\u2019 and it will obey you. Luke 21:36 (ESV) \u2014 But stay awake at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.\u201d Ever notice that nowhere in the Gospels can you find Jesus directly answering the question of how one increases their faith? I was frustrated at that for a while when I was wanting more faith, like the apostles. Finally, I realized that the Bible gives us the answer elsewhere and everywhere. In the many stories of the Bible, we see God's servants walking prayerfully with him through hardships and learning several things in the process. They learn how to recognize his hand leading. This normally does not consist of voices, dreams, and visions, but of coincidences or \"God-incidences\" or \"open doors\" (Rev 3:8, 20) and \"closed doors\" (Rev 3:7). They learn what he is likely to do or lead us to do and what he is not likely to do nor lead us to do. They learn how to trust him when the situation looks like he has abandoned them and just wait in patience and peace until the clear direction to act comes if any action is required. In other words, they learn faith and how to act on it. If you pray daily about having faith and strength as Jesus instructed, then you can be sure that God will hear that prayer according to his will. In response, he will direct you just as he did the servants in the Bible who wanted the same thing. You will be put in sometimes uncomfortable situations like they were which require you to be bold and radical at times, and to be inactive or meek at other times; the whole gamut. This will prepare you for all situations including the coming crisis of decision over leaving your home country early enough to escape the Mark of the Beast. By the way, as far as finances and other logistics, when the time to escape comes, God has a plan to give provision to all those who choose in faith to obey the command to escape. See my article on the faith to escape to understand that situation. What Not To Do... Lastly, a warning: Emigration to Israel for non-Jews is generally not possible today. The way must be opened up, not just for our move, but several end-time events also require a major change in Israel. For example, the construction of the Third Temple or the sealing of the 144,000 on the Temple Mount can't happen today without Arab control of the Temple Mount being eradicated. I expect the prophesied M.E. nuclear war against Israel where Damascus is laid waste to bring that about. Conclusion The Mark of the Beast is going to be far more irresistible than most Christians can imagine. But the solution to its challenge is not to get distracted today by trying to figure out exactly what it is in advance. Even if you did figure that out, it would do you no good. If you see the mark, it will already be too late to escape it with your life intact. The proper escape plan will instead require faith and proactive, radical action. Unfortunately, as Jesus insinuated, faith will be a rare trait in the end times (Lk 18:8). Further, you do not learn bold and radical action by just going to church every Sunday and listening to your pastor. The answer is to follow Jesus' advice to stay awake and to pray daily for \"the strength to escape what is coming\" (Lk 21:36). God will be sure to answer that prayer by guiding your life so that you get the experiences and information which will develop the faith and radical streak you will need when the time comes. What's more, these two things will help you to serve God and shine your light even better every day along the way, just like the faithful maverick Jesus did.

For full approval, a pharmaceutical company usually has to submit all of the following: documentation on the drug\u2019s manufacturing quality, preclinical studies (animal studies), phase 1 and phase 2 studies in humans, and 12 months worth of phase 3 trial results that prove beyond doubt the efficacy and the safety of a candidate drug. The COVID \u201cvaccines\u201d were given \u201ctemporary\u201d or \u201cconditional\u201d approval worldwide based on very much shortened phase 3 trials, which lasted only 2 months instead of 12 months [2,3], and on insufficient or missing animal studies, i.e. they received only an \u201cemergency approval.\u201d The primary clinical endpoints used in the phase 3 studies were not clinically and socially relevant, as predominantly mild, minor events such as headache, cough or fever were counted as \u201cCOVID disease cases\u201d, just as long as the RT-PCR test for the coronavirus was positive. An effect of the \u201cvaccinations\u201d on \u201csevere COVID illnesses\u201d, which among other things required hospitalization, was only analyzed secondarily [4,5]. Thus, in order to obtain approval, the manufacturers were not formally required to prove that the \u201cvaccinations\u201d reduce severe courses of disease to a relevant extent. The fact that the regulatory authorities worldwide accepted this flawed study design for granting approval indicates that they were not able to act independently. To date, the clinical trials have not demonstrated any relevant benefit [6], pivotal documents overall were demonstrably completely inadequate, and moreover the data from the phase 3 studies were manipulated [7\u20139]. Once a drug is approved, the manufacturer is required to further investigate its efficacy and safety under real-world conditions. The data generated in this way are subsequently submitted to the regulatory authorities, and the results are presented to physicians as \u201creal world evidence\u201d to convince them that these data, ideally, support the findings from the clinical trials and thus to encourage them to use this drug on their patients. 2. What does the reality of \u201cCOVID vaccines\u201d show? The internationally available \u201cReal World Evidence\u201d data of the COVID \u201cvaccines\u201d confirm what the registration studies had already indicated: The \u201cvaccines\u201d are not associated with any relevant benefit, but on the contrary with a negative effect. A robust analysis by Kyle Beattie, who examined publicly published COVID data from Our World in Data, shows that for 145 countries, \u201cvaccine\u201d use correlates positively with the number of \u201cCOVID cases\u201d and, far more worryingly, with the number of \u201cCOVID deaths\u201d [11]. The countries which appear to fare the worst after introduction of the \u201cvaccines\u201d are those where few \u201cCOVID deaths\u201d had been reported for 2020 (e.g., Thailand). Based on Beattie\u2019s results, it must be assumed that almost all countries experienced more infections and deaths than if \u201cvaccination\u201d had not been given. Beattie based his model for calculating the hypothetical morbidity and mortality that would have occurred without \u201cvaccination\u201d on the data from four African countries which had very low vaccination rates throughout, and which therefore could be used rather like a \u201ccontrol group.\u201d Beattie\u2019s conclusions are corroborated by other observations. As of early August 2022, official figures report 6.4 million deaths that have occurred with or from COVID-19. A look at the progression curve of \u201cCOVID deaths\u201d recorded worldwide does not reveal any favorable effect on \u201cCOVID deaths\u201d concomitant with the roll-out of the vaccines in late 2020\/early 2021 (Figure 1). Overall, \u201cCOVID deaths\u201d actually increased after the introduction of the \u201cvaccination\u201d and stagnated at a high level throughout 2021. With an effective vaccine, of course, a clearly discernible drop in the mortality curve would have been expected after the onset of a worldwide vaccination campaign. Israel is an instructive example, because it achieved high vaccination rates earlier than most other countries. According to EuroMomo, Israel experienced its highest excess mortality ever since the beginning of the \u201cCorona crisis\u201d in the first quarter of 2022, i.e. at a time when the majority of the population was supposedly maximally protected by the \u201cmRNA vaccines\u201d\u2014even though during this period only the Omicron variant was endemic, which is about ten times less dangerous than the original Wuhan strain and the Delta variant [12]. Increases in excess mortality were correlated in time with vaccination drives (Figure 2). A similar correlation in time is also evident between vaccinations and deaths specifically attributed to COVID-19 (data not shown). In the USA, the introduction of COVID vaccinations was followed not by a leveling off but by a sustained increase in all-cause mortality (Figure 3). Australia, too, is experiencing a similar phenomenon: After the Australian Department of Health recommended a second \u201cbooster dose\u201d of COVID vaccination to all persons aged 30 years and older in July 2022, the country is experiencing a peak in \u201cCOVID deaths\u201d of unprecedented proportions, even though the harmless Omicron variant remains predominant (Figure 4). 3. On what data do Watson et al. base their conclusion that COVID \u201cvaccination\u201d has prevented 14 million deaths? The study in question is a mathematical modeling exercise which, like any exercise, depends on the underlying data. A closer look at these data raises serious questions\u2014pertaining not only to the scientific value of this publication, but also to its credibility. In the \u201cmodeling study\u201d by Watson et al., hypothetical data serve as the baseline, not real observations: \u201cFor this mathematical modeling study, we used a previously published COVID-19 transmission model and fitting framework to obtain profiles of the COVID-19 pandemic in each country.\u201d The authors thus used previously published models to calculate their projections of the hypothetical COVID mortality that would have occurred without vaccination. The problem with these published models is that they date from the early days of the \u201cpandemic\u201d and are based on data and assumptions which were out of date by 2021 at the latest, and which are now demonstrably wrong. In the meantime, it has become clear that SARS-CoV-2 is neither exceptionally dangerous for the general population nor a threat to the health care system. Already at the beginning of the \u201cpandemic\u201d, i.e. at a time when the original Wuhan strain of the virus was prevalent, the infection fatality rate (IFR) was 0.15% overall, less than 0.05% for those under 70 years of age, and 0.00% for children [16]. The IFR of the currently circulating Omicron variant is about 10 times lower than that of the Wuhan strain and the Delta variant [12]. All assumptions on which millions of \u201cCOVID deaths\u201d have been estimated worldwide are therefore fundamentally incorrect and obsolete. 4. Watson et al. used inflated \u201cCOVID death\u201d rates It is now known that \u201cCOVID deaths\u201d have been massively overcounted worldwide, because both \u201cconfirmed cases\u201d and \u201cprobable cases\u201d have been lumped together in those case statistics [17]. \u201cConfirmed cases\u201d are counted based on matching (yet non-specific) clinical symptoms together with a positive RT-PCR test result, whereas with \u201cprobable\u201d cases no corroborating PCR test result is available. The practice of counting \u201cprobable COVID cases\u201d based only on generic symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection makes no sense from a medical point of view; it can serve only to inflate the case count in an unscientific manner. The Corman-Drosten RT-PCR test protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 [18] is scientifically more than deficient: the test based on it is not validated, not standardized, hypersensitive, and not very specific; its specificity is 98.6% and 92.4% in the absence and presence of other beta-coronaviruses, respectively, and rates of false positive results consequently are 1.4% and 7.6 [19,20]. In only 5% of the \u201cCOVID deaths\u201d recorded in the USA was COVID-19 listed as the sole cause of death on the death certificate, and thus an illness due to SARS-CoV-2 was causally responsible for the death [21]. A study from Italy showed that even only 0.8% of the \u201cCOVID deaths\u201d did not have a concomitant disease [22]. Instead of taking these facts into account and correcting the case numbers downwards accordingly, Watson et al. even argue that a massive under-reporting of \u201cCOVID deaths\u201d must be assumed. If the enormously high COVID mortality predicted by the modeling were true, then this should have invariably been reflected in a relevant increase in excess mortality during the winter months when the \u201ccorona pandemic\u201d was rampant, but prior to the introduction of vaccination. 5. No relevant excess mortality in the 2020 pandemic winter This, however, is demonstrably not the case: no relevant long-lasting increase in deaths from any cause (\u201call-cause mortality\u201d) was observed for the winter of 2020. Rancourt has examined the correlation in time between the WHO\u2019s declaration of the \u201cpandemic\u201d and all-cause mortality in various jurisdictions [23]. Immediately after the declaration, there occurred a sharp peak in all-cause mortality in some jurisdictions, but not in others; this discrepancy is illustrated in Figure 5 for New York City and Texas. Common sense and historic precedents suggest that the spread of a deadly virus would not be stopped by international or state borders. Furthermore, if the virus had indeed been both deadly and truly novel, the wave of deaths in New York should not have subsided within such a short period of time as is apparent from Figure 5. The peak may instead signify that infected persons were transferred to New York City from other regions, were (mis)treated there, and died. The mortality curve for the state of Texas shows no abnormalities for the winter of 2020, neither before nor after the WHO\u2019s declaration of the pandemic. The same also applies to other jurisdictions such as Canada (Figure 6) and Europe. Thus, it is plain that in Winter 2020 there was no pattern of excess mortality that would reflect an usually severe and deadly virus pandemic. 6. False assumptions serve as the basis for the calculations The data used in the Watson et al. \u201cmodeling study\u201d were based on hypotheses related to the Corona pandemic that have since been shown to be clearly wrong, namely: that there is no preexisting immunity and that the pandemic will affect everyone; that its effect can only be mitigated by political measures. Ad 1: Serological investigations have shown that SARS-CoV-2 was endemic in Italy as early as September 2019 [25] and in France as early as November 2019 [26], which is thus likely true for Europe in general. However, at this time, no clustered disease activity was observed clinically. Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were found in up to 53% of asymptomatic individuals, whose serum samples had been collected in the pre-pandemic phase in Italy. In the meantime, more than 90 studies prove that a past infection with SARS-CoV-2 protects better against a recurrence of the disease than the vaccines [27]. While reinfections with new variants are possible, they are not severe [28]. These crucial facts are completely ignored by the authors. On the contrary, they speculate that possibly even more deaths than the estimated 14 million have been prevented by the \u201cvaccination\u201d, because in their calculations they may have underestimated the effect of the immune system\u2019s failure to recognize new variants, which according to them would further increase the risk of a new infection. Ad 2: Over 400 studies show that non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdowns or school closures to prevent a pandemic are associated with no benefit, only harm [29]. Sweden, as one of the countries where hardly any restrictions were applied, performed significantly better in terms of the number of \u201cCOVID deaths\u201d than many other countries with strict lockdown measures (Figure 7). 7. The claim of \u201cvaccination success\u201d is based on unscientific calculations While Kyle Beattie\u2019s estimate of hypothetical COVID mortality without vaccination is based on real data, namely on observations from countries with very low vaccination rates [11], Watson et al. use completely unrealistic and demonstrably false figures for their calculations to supposedly prove the efficacy of the COVID \u201cvaccines.\u201d This leads them to estimate an excessively high mortality which allegedly would have occurred without \u201cvaccination.\u201d From these inflated hypothetical death counts, they then subtract the officially reported deaths to obtain the \u201csuccess of vaccination\u201d (Figure 8). It is difficult to conceive of a more unscientific and misleading methodology than this one. 8. Serious conflicts of interest If a publication raises as many questions as this one, then it is imperative to find out how it was financed. According to the declaration in the published paper itself, this \u201cmodeling study\u201d was funded by, among others, the very institutions that earn millions from the \u201cvaccinations\u201d, thanks to an impressive return on investment ratio of 20:1 [31]. 9. Conclusion The hypothesis that the COVID \u201cvaccinations\u201d prevented 14 million \u201cCOVID deaths\u201d and thus significantly mitigated the severity of the \u201cpandemic\u201d is based on unrealistic figures and demonstrably false calculations. To date, the experimental \u201cvaccines\u201d, for which an integration into the human genome cannot be safely ruled out [32,33] and must even be considered likely [34], have not been able to prove a relevant benefit, neither in the clinical studies before their approval nor afterwards. Real world evidence shows that the \u201cCOVID vaccination\u201d is associated with a negative effect overall and positively correlates with an increase in morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as in all-cause mortality. Overall, the \u201cmodeling study\u201d by Watson et al. must be considered an unscientific and dishonest attempt to falsely cast the \u201cvaccines\u201d in a positive light. The serious conflicts of interest surrounding the study undermine not only the credibility of the publication itself, but also that of the medical journal which published it.

        "text":"The sweeping effects of virtual learning during the peak of the pandemic \u2014 students\u2019 complaints of falling behind, struggling to concentrate and focus, not engaging on a personal level with teachers or receiving special instruction, missing peer interactions \u2014 are not new to parents of students with learning differences. Pandemic-induced school disruptions, which deprived many kids of accessing a fair and appropriate public education, resemble the challenges that students with learning differences have faced for decades. How Learning Disorders Breed Shame We, as parents, know all too well the stress, anxiety, and physical and emotional symptoms associated with learning challenges. We understand the frustration of trying to turn around woeful school engagement in our kids and their educators, too. When my children are denied the accommodations they need, this quickly leads to anger, battles about going to school, and self-talk that includes \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201cI know I have to try harder.\u201d I have seen how difficult it is to enlighten school district personnel and explain that a student\u2019s poor behavior and negative self-talk are the direct result of not receiving the accommodations that are appropriate and necessary for academic success. When I asked for support and a 504 Plan, school administrators said to me: \u201cSuzy knows what she needs to do.\u201d As if my daughter chooses not to do it. As if any child chooses ADHD, dyslexia, or any other learning challenges. [Download: What Learning Disabilities Look Like in the Classroom] In another 504 Plan meeting, I asked the teacher if my child, who had just received a good grade for an assignment, had used any accommodations. The teacher\u2019s response: \u201cNo, she did not cheat.\u201d How can my child feel good about using the services she needs if this is the prevailing opinion of her teacher? It\u2019s a devastating blow when teachers and administrators fail to provide adequate assessments and resources \u2014 whether due to budget issues, staffing shortages, ignorance about ADHD, or the pandemic \u2014 to support a child\u2019s academic success. As parents, we watch as these interactions project shame and blame onto our children, who suffer through years of negative experiences in school. More awareness and an investment in teacher training would go a long way toward improving academic success in students with learning differences. The Social-Emotional Impact of Learning Disorders After living through three academic years impacted by the pandemic, all parents understand the heartbreak of witnessing their students\u2019 social-emotional struggles, learning loss, and mental health conflicts. Let this experience be a window through which parents and educators gain insight into the too-often unmet needs of kids with learning differences. Most students with learning challenges have long struggled with the emotional and social toll resulting not from the disability directly, but from a school system that limits or creates barriers to accessing the full suite of accommodations kids need to engage fully in learning. We must all speak up to help our local educators and policy makers see this important connection. Learning Disorders and ADHD: Next Steps SUPPORT ADDITUDE Thank you for reading ADDitude.

One year later, we witness a war within the Bill Gates pharmaceutical cartel. This is the confirmation that Davos has completely lose [sic] control. This is the confirmation that Davos has received a tremendous defeat.\u201d This is what Italian geopolitical commentator Cesare Sacchetti has to say on this topic (Telegram, August 27, 2022): ER Editor: So vaccine companies can sue each other but we can\u2019t sue them. Miss a day, miss a lot. Subscribe to The Defender\u2019s Top News of the Day. It\u2019s free. Moderna today filed patent infringement lawsuits against Pfizer and BioNTech, alleging the two companies copied Moderna\u2019s patented mRNA technology and claiming neither of the companies possessed the necessary know-how to have produced the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine on their own. In a statement, Moderna alleged the two companies infringed on patents Moderna filed between 2010 and 2016. Moderna, based in Cambridge, Mass., filed its lawsuit against Pfizer in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. It sued Germany-based BioNTech in the Regional Court of D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. Though Moderna has been in existence for only a decade, the company is considered \u201can innovator in the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology that enabled the unprecedented speed in developing the COVID-19 vaccine,\u201d according to Reuters. However, in an interview with The Defender, Dr. Robert Malone, who helped develop the mRNA technology used in COVID-19 vaccines and who has become an outspoken critic of the vaccines and pandemic countermeasures, suggested the Moderna lawsuit may represent only the tip of the iceberg, in relation to legal disputes over patents. Moderna: Pfizer and BioNTech used patented technology without permission Remarking on the lawsuit, Moderna CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel said in a statement: \u201cWe are filing these lawsuits to protect the innovative mRNA technology platform that we pioneered, invested billions of dollars in creating, and patented during the decade preceding the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cThis foundational platform, which we began building in 2010, along with our patented work on coronaviruses in 2015 and 2016, enabled us to produce a safe and highly effective Covid-19 vaccine in record time after the pandemic struck.\u201d According to the statement, \u201cPfizer and BioNTech copied two key features of Moderna\u2019s patented technologies which are critical to the success of mRNA vaccines.\u201d The BBC explained that one type of infringement alleged by Moderna involves \u201can mRNA structure that Moderna says its scientists began developing in 2010 and were the first to validate in human trials in 2015.\u201d The second infringement claimed by Moderna \u201cinvolves the coding of the spike protein on the outside of the [COVID-19] virus itself,\u201d the BBC reported. \u201cWhen COVID-19 emerged, neither Pfizer nor BioNTech had Moderna\u2019s level of experience with developing mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases, and they knowingly followed Moderna\u2019s lead in developing their own vaccine,\u201d Moderna claimed in its statement. Moderna also claimed Pfizer and BioNTech tested candidate COVID-19 vaccines that did not use technology Moderna claims violates its copyright, but ultimately opted not to develop them. According to Moderna: \u201cFirst, Pfizer and BioNTech took four different vaccine candidates into clinical testing, which included options that would have steered clear of Moderna\u2019s innovative path. \u201cPfizer and BioNTech, however, ultimately decided to proceed with a vaccine that has the same exact mRNA chemical modification to its vaccine as Spikevax\u00ae.\u201d Pfizer and BioNTech then copied the spike protein Moderna originally developed. Moderna said: \u201cSecond, and again despite having many different options, Pfizer and BioNTech copied Moderna\u2019s approach to encode for the full-length spike protein in a lipid nanoparticle formulation for a coronavirus. \u201cModerna scientists developed this approach when they created a vaccine for the coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) years before COVID-19 first emerged.\u201d \u201cAlthough the MERS vaccine never went to market, its development helped Moderna rapidly roll out its COVID-19 vaccine,\u201d according to Reuters. Moderna said none of the patent rights it is seeking to enforce are related to intellectual property it developed as a result of its collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for the development of COVID-19 treatments. Moderna received $2.5 billion in taxpayer funding to support the development of its COVID-19 vaccine, The New York Times reported. Moderna, in October 2020, \u201cpledged not to enforce its COVID-19 related [sic] patents while the pandemic continued,\u201d according to the company\u2019s statement. However, the company said it \u201cupdated\u201d its pledge on March 7, 2022, \u201cwhen the collective fight against COVID-19 entered a new phase and vaccine supply was no longer a barrier to access in many parts of the world.\u201d As part of this \u201cupdated\u201d pledge, Moderna \u201cmade clear that while it would never enforce its patents for any COVID-19 vaccine used in the 92 low- and middle-income countries in the GAVI COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC92),\u201d the company \u201cexpected companies such as Pfizer and BioNTech to respect its intellectual property rights.\u201d Moderna said it \u201cwould consider a commercially reasonable license\u201d if requested by other companies, but added, \u201cPfizer and BioNTech have failed to do so.\u201d Shannon Thyme Klinger, Moderna\u2019s chief legal officer, said, \u201cPfizer and BioNTech unlawfully copied Moderna\u2019s invention, and that they have continued to use them without permission.\u201d Based on the date the company updated its pledge \u2014 March 7 \u2014 Moderna said it is \u201cnot seeking damages for activities occurring before March 8, 2022,\u201d adding that it is \u201cnot seeking to remove Comirnaty\u00ae from the market \u2026 is not asking for an injunction to prevent its future sale [and] is not seeking damages related to Pfizer\u2019s sales to AMC92 countries.\u201d As of Friday morning, Pfizer had not responded to the allegations. A spokeswoman for the company, Jerica Pitts, said the company had not been served with a suit and was \u201cunable to comment at this time.\u201d Malone: \u2018Skirmish\u2019 between Moderna and Pfizer \u2018part of a larger effort to assert primacy in the mRNA vaccine domain by a variety of corporations\u2019 In an interview with The Defender, Malone characterized Moderna\u2019s lawsuit as \u201cpart of a larger ongoing dispute over the origins and patent coverage relevant to the mRNA vaccine technology\u201d \u2014 while accusing Moderna and others of failure to cite other prior patents, including his own. Malone said one of the patents under dispute in Moderna\u2019s lawsuit involves the \u201cdelivery and formulation of engineered nucleic acids.\u201d The other patents at the heart of the dispute between Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, according to Malone, \u201cinvolve broad claims concerning rights to express a full-length spike protein from any coronavirus using a modified mRNA approach.\u201d Malone said these patents are \u201calso at risk for re-examination due to being overly broad.\u201d He described the \u201cskirmish\u201d between Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech as being \u201cpart of a larger effort to assert primacy in the mRNA vaccine domain by a variety of corporations.\u201d At its root, the dispute is \u201creally an extension of the concerted effort previously made by BioNTech and UPenn [the University of Pennsylvania] to claim Katalin Karik\u00f3 and Drew Weissman as the original inventors of the [mRNA] technology,\u201d instead of himself, Malone said. He said this is transpiring \u201cas part of a press campaign advocating that [Karik\u00f3 and Weissman] receive the Nobel Prize for their work.\u201d Referring more broadly to Moderna\u2019s lawsuit, Malone said it is \u201cabout Moderna attempting to extract money from Pfizer-BioNTech on claims that involve at least one issued patent which clearly failed to cite relevant prior art, both in published literature and in issued U.S. patents.\u201d \u201cOne outcome of this lawsuit,\u201d said Malone, \u201cmay be that [one] patent is invalidated for failure to cite, and the other patents cited may be at risk for invalidation due to being overly broad.\u201d According to Reuters, legal disputes involving patents are \u201cnot uncommon in the early stages of new technology,\u201d adding that all of the companies involved in the suit are already embroiled in other lawsuits. For instance, Pfizer and BioNTech were sued for patent infringement by German company CureVac. In turn, The Verge reported, Moderna was sued by two biotechnology companies, Arbutus Biopharma and Genevant Sciences, \u201cover the method for packaging up the mRNA and delivering it to the body.\u201d Arbutus also succeeded in a previous patent infringement challenge against Moderna, in 2020. And all three companies involved in the latest lawsuit \u2014 Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna \u2014 were sued by another biotechnology company, Alnylam, over a similar technology. Moderna is also involved in a separate legal dispute with the NIH involving rights to mRNA technology. Bancel, in touting the importance of the mRNA technology for Moderna, went on to claim in the company\u2019s statement that Moderna \u201cis continuing to use the technology to develop treatments for influenza and HIV, as well as autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases and rare forms of cancer.\u201d Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine is the company\u2019s only commercial product \u2014 one that has delivered $10.4 billion in revenue, in contrast to the almost $22 billion in revenue Pfizer has generated from its COVID-19 vaccine. News of the lawsuit came amidst a recent report, on Aug. 24, that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is likely to approve updated versions of both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 boosters. Early reaction to the lawsuit on the part of investors was negative, with Pfizer shares falling 1.4% and BioNTech shares declining by about 2% in early morning trading before the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange. While the markets may be expressing some jitters in relation to Pfizer as a result of this lawsuit, for Malone, the main issue at hand comes back to the original development of mRNA technology \u2014 and who has, perhaps improperly, benefitted from it. Speaking in reference to patents related to mRNA technology, Malone told The Defender:",

For example, if the virus had already infected large numbers of people, the justification for the lockdowns of mid-March 2020 to \u2018slow or stop the spread\u2019 of a newly arrived virus would be shown to be nonsense. Estimates of the number of people who had already developed natural immunity as well as of the infection fatality rate (IFR) might be dramatically different. It would suggest the disease was not nearly as lethal as experts proclaimed. The mass fear in the public \u2013 a prerequisite for lockdowns and later for mass vaccinations \u2013 might be much lower. Given these points, it\u2019s odd public health officials and investigative journalists have eschewed serious investigations that might confirm this virus had already spread around the world before January 1st 2020. (ER: Yes it is, but well no, it\u2019s not really.) A commonsense project to \u2018prove\u2019 early spread was occurring would be simply to test tranches of blood that were donated before the birth date of the official outbreak (December 31st 2019). Surprisingly, however, very few antibody studies of archived blood collected before December 31st 2019 have occurred. Will Jones recently highlighted one such study published by researchers in France as well as a sewage study from Brazil. The first provides antibody evidence and the second RNA evidence the novel coronavirus was spreading by November 2019 in these countries. To Will\u2019s list, I\u2019d add the only antibody study of archived Red Cross blood conducted by the U.S. CDC to date. This study found 39 antibody-positive serum samples collected December 13th-16th 2019 in California, Washington and Oregon (2% of blood samples collected from these states tested positive for antibodies). As it takes the human body one to two weeks to produce detectable levels of antibodies, most of these 39 antibody-positive donors had been infected in November 2019 if not earlier. For some reason, American officials performed only one antibody study of blood collected by blood bank organisations. It\u2019s also strange that results of this study were not published until November 30th 2020 \u2013 more than 11 months after the first tranche of archived Red Cross blood had been collected. In a CDC press briefing held May 29th 2020, CDC officials stated they\u2019d searched for and could find no evidence the novel coronavirus had been \u201cintroduced\u201d anywhere in America prior to January 20th 2020. I believe this statement was false as by the time this press briefing was held, copious evidence of early spread had already been disseminated via published news accounts. For example, I\u2019ve identified at least 17 Americans who were sick with definite Covid symptoms in November and December 2019 and all 17 had antibody evidence of prior infection. Also, all 17 of these reports were published by prominent news organisations at least 13 days before this press conference. While a source of important evidence, antibody studies are not necessary to prove that early spread almost certainly occurred in America. Close examination of individual case histories also allows one confidently to reach this conclusion. What follows is a summary of three individual histories that lead me to conclude community spread was already occurring in America by November 2019 and probably October 2019. For details on other American cases that date to December 2019, see this Seattle Times story and a feature story I wrote that, for some reason, was completely ignored by the mainstream press and public health officials, a fact I document in this follow-up article. Case 1: Michael Melham of Belleville, NJ Michael Melham, the Mayor of Belleville, NJ, was among a large group of New Jersey municipal employees who attended a conference in Atlantic City on November 19th-21st 2019. While at the conference, Melham experienced symptoms common to COVID-19. \u201cI was definitely feeling sick when I was there, and fought my way through it,\u201d Mayor Melham told NJ Advance Media on April 30th 2020. \u201cI have never been sicker in my entire life,\u201d the Mayor said. \u201cThese symptoms included a 102-degree fever, chills, hallucinations and a sore throat that lasted for three weeks.\u201d In a story published by Fox News, Mayor Melham said the illness made him feel \u201clike a heroin addict going through withdrawals\u2026 I didn\u2019t know what was happening to me. I never felt that I could be so sick\u201c. Mayor Melham felt sick enough to contact his doctor who diagnosed him with the flu. However, this diagnosis was given \u201cover the phone\u201d and Melham never actually received a flu test. In late April 2020, Melham visited his doctor for his annual physical and brought up his November illness. The doctor administered an antibody test, which came back positive for Covid antibodies. Melham later told me he actually received two positive antibody tests (previous reports mentioned just one). \u201cMy first antibody test was a rapid test. My second was a blood test that was sent to a lab. Both were positive for the longer antibody,\u201d Mayor Melham wrote in one email. Mayor Melham has repeatedly made the important (if ignored) point that he tested positive for the \u2018long\u2019 (IgG) antibody. He tested negative for the IgM antibody. The presence of IgM antibodies indicate more recent infection and, per studies, these antibodies fade and are only detectable for about a month after infection. This combination of antibody results would seem to rule out the possibility Mayor Melham experienced an asymptomatic case of Covid in the month before receiving his first antibody test. The only time Melham was sick was November 2020. He added: \u201cI will also tell you that since the media attention surrounding my claim, many others have come forward. I have emails from those who were actually at the same conference in Atlantic City NJ, who became just as sick as I was.\u201d Those who wish to gauge the credibility of the Mayor\u2019s claims can view this four-minute YouTube interview with Mayor Melham. I also asked Mayor Melham a question no other journalist seems to have asked him. \u201cDid any public health official ever contact you to investigate your possible case?\u201d Melham\u2019s email response: \u201cNo, nothing.\u201d Multiple acquaintances as well as his physician would confirm Melham was sick with symptoms common to Covid victims in November. Since he received two positive antibody tests, if the results were a false positive, he received two false positives. As noted, Mayor Melham reports receiving emails from \u201cmultiple people\u2026 who were at the same conference who became just as sick as I was\u201d. This would suggest the presence of community spread \u2013 a possibility which might have been confirmed if contact tracers had tested the people who\u2019d been sick at the same conference for antibodies. We know no public health officials contacted Mayor Melham to investigate his claim. We also know, thanks to nj.com\u2018s reporting, that state health officials were aware of his claim: Asked about the Mayor\u2019s statements, the state health department declined comment. A spokesperson for Gov. Phil Murphy did not immediately respond to a message. The following points should also be emphasised. If his diagnosis had been confirmed by public health officials, Mayor Melham would have been the first known Covid case in the world, and would have been the first confirmed case in America by approximately 61 days (the first official case in America is still recorded as January 20th 2020 \u2013 a man from Washington state who had recently returned from Wuhan). Significantly, Mayor Melham can date the onset of his symptoms. Per numerous studies, it takes two to 14 days after infection for symptoms to manifest. This means Mayor Melham would have been infected some time between November 5th and November 19th 2019. Since Mayor Melham did not give the virus to himself, logic tells us the chain of transmission that ended with Michael Melham being symptomatic around November 20th 2019 very possibly began before November 1st 2019. This would mean that community spread was possibly occurring in New Jersey as early as October 2019. Case 2: Uf Tukel of Delray Beach, Florida As reported by Palm Beach Post on May 16th 2020: At least 11 people\u2026 on two small blocks alone\u2026 in a small Delray Beach (Florida) neighborhood tested positive for coronavirus antibodies in April. They felt symptoms as early as November (2019). \u201cIt didn\u2019t have a name back then, but I have no doubt now that it was the coronavirus,\u201d one neighbour said. The article names seven of these individuals and provides details and quotes about their symptoms. These seven people include Uf Tukel who was \u201cfirst among (residents of the neighborhood) to feel sick in late November (2019)\u2026 For weeks, he had body aches, a severe cough and night sweats\u201d. While \u201cTukel is reluctant to say he had the coronavirus a month before Chinese officials reported the outbreak to the World Health Organisation, \u2018I had all the symptoms though,\u2019 Tukel said.\u201d The same logic applied to Michael Melham\u2019s possible case would apply to Mr. Tukel\u2019s possible case. That is, whoever first infected Mr. Tukel was infected earlier than Tukel was, suggesting early spread was also happening by some point in November, if not October, in Delray Beach, Florida. If confirmed, Mr. Tukel\u2019s case would indicate that American cases in November were not isolated to the state of New Jersey. Several other points included in the Post\u2019s coverage deserve attention. These possible DelRay Beach cases include two couples, with one spouse presumably infecting the other. One child of one of these couples became infected, providing further evidence of community spread. According to the story, none of the individuals experienced close contacts with other non-family residents of the same neighbourhood. That is, there seems to be no evidence of neighbour-to-neighbour transmission. According to the story, \u201call (11 individuals) recovered and haven\u2019t been sick since\u201d. None of the 11 had travelled to China. Like Michael Melham, none of these 11 people tested positive for the \u2018short\u2019 (IgM) antibodies \u2013 thus none had been recently infected. The Post article also includes this eye-opening information: \u201cSince March (2020) about two-fifths (approximately 200, 40%) of the 500 antibody tests taken by Xera Med (a DelRay Beach private testing lab\/medical clinic) have been positive, said CEO Emily Rentz.\u201d The first two confirmed cases in Florida were recorded March 1st. The following sentence from this article might be even more significant: \u201cThe lab shares its data on positive tests with the state health department, (Rentz) added.\u201d And from the same article: \u201cThe state wouldn\u2019t say whether it is collecting antibody data from hospitals or private laboratories.\u201d The Post article referenced a May 5th article by the same newspaper: In Florida, health department reports show patients who eventually tested positive for the virus experienced symptoms as early as January. The Florida Department of Health hasn\u2019t explained those potential fault lines in the state\u2019s assertion that the first cases didn\u2019t appear in Florida until March. The fact 40% of 500 antibody tests administered by the clinic between March and early May 2020 tested positive for Covid antibodies suggests infections were widespread in this community. And according to the CEO of this lab, these antibody results were being shared with Florida State Department of Health officials. And apparently these weren\u2019t the only positive antibody results that were being reported by testing labs. As reported in the same article: The University of Miami, in randomly testing Miami-Dade County residents for antibodies, has found that the rate of infection could be 16 times higher than state data suggests, said Dr. Erin Kobetz, a professor and lead researcher on the project\u2026 Since first publishing her findings, Kobetz has heard from several people who shared experiences similar to the Tropic Isle neighbours\u2026 They described being sick in December and later testing positive for antibodies. They asked if what they\u2019d experienced was COVID-19. Significantly, if we count possible December 2019 cases, these are Americans from five widely-dispersed U.S. states whose stories were featured in published articles. An unknown number of Americans who\u2019ve never been featured in a newspaper article undoubtedly fit the same profile. If one adds this unknown number of never-identified people to the list of known individuals, evidence the novel coronavirus was spreading widely across America in November and December 2019 becomes even more compelling. Not every infectious disease expert agrees with the CDC\u2019s assessment that widespread transmission did not begin until January 20th 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that the disease spread as early as November,\u201d Dr. Kobetz said. As in New Jersey, apparently no official with the Florida Department of Health contacted any of the 11 people referenced in the Post\u2019s article. Nor have public health officials apparently followed up with Emily Renz, CEO of Xera Med, who stated approximately 200 other local residents received positive Covid antibody tests at the clinic between March and the end of April. Ms. Renz noted that information on all of these positive test results had been forwarded to officials at the state\u2019s health agency. Which prompts this question: How many clinics and testing labs in America also forwarded positive antibody test results to state health agencies, agencies which presumably could and would pass this information along to their colleagues at the CDC or NIH? What the public doesn\u2019t know but should is how many other Americans \u2013 those whose lab results were not reported in the press \u2013 also tested positive for antibodies between March and early May 2020. Presumably, the CDC and state and local health agencies have these data, which have never been released to the public. Indeed, I\u2019ve come to believe it\u2019s possible at least some high-ranking officials may have conspired to suppress antibody results which, if published, might have led the public to conclude this virus was spreading widely months before officials said it had been introduced in this country. Such knowledge might have changed the way tens of millions of Americans evaluated their personal Covid risk as well as their support for lockdowns. Case 3: Shane from Marin County, California Perhaps the first early case in America (with antibody evidence that would confirm infection) is Shane of Marin County, California. Shane\u2019s possible early case was not featured in a newspaper article, but by Shane himself in the reader comments section that followed a May 7th 2020 New York Times story (the story describes symptoms experienced by Covid patients). Writes Shane: \u201cI had COVID-19 last fall, far earlier than anyone else I\u2019ve heard of. I suspect I caught it while on an overseas trip to Italy and the Middle East \u2013 I\u2019ve taken two antibody tests in the past month, both of which confirmed I was infected.\u201d As Shane recounts, he was extremely sick with signature Covid symptoms. For me the worst symptom by far was the dry, unproductive cough. The cough was so intense, so relentless, it left me with bruised ribs and a horrible searing pain in my chest, which also felt as if someone were sitting on it. The fever at one point reach 104.9 upon which I began hallucinating \u2013 seeing my dogs talking to me and forgetting how to open a sliding glass door. Horrible chills which led to my teeth chattering so hard my jaw ached were also another noxious gift of Covid. What I most remember about my experience with Covid is pain, pain from coughing, pain in my body and head, pain everywhere around me, like a smothering red blanket. At times I felt I was going to die during that week and even today I must admit I am surprised I didn\u2019t. Adding credibility to his claim, Shane\u2019s post cited two labs where he claims to have received his positive antibody tests. The local health centre in West Marin is where I took the latest one. The other one I took directly at the manufacturer\u2019s location \u2013 ARCpoint Labs in Richmond. That one is only 87% accurate and not FDA approved so that\u2019s why I took the more recent one, which was done through Quest Labs I believe. In the comment thread, one poster suggests it\u2019s unlikely Shane developed Covid as there had been no reported confirmed cases from that time. This poster opines that Shane was sick with some other nasty virus and later developed an asymptomatic case of Covid. However, Shane stuck to his theory and presented reasons for his opinion. I suppose it\u2019s possible but I tend to think that since what I contracted had the exact same symptoms as COVID-19 \u2013 that COVID-19 is what I had. In addition, mid-February through mid-March I was in isolation, caring for my sister who died mid-March from metastatic cervical cancer. When COVID-19 made its first appearance in the U.S. in February we very quickly put in strict isolation protocols as my sister had a compromised immune system due to chemotherapy, further insulating myself from contact and infection as well. Shane does not report what month he thinks he had Covid \u2013 only that it was \u201clast fall\u2026 and far earlier than anyone else I\u2019ve heard.\u201d He could have been sick in November, but maybe even in October. Shane (if he really had Covid) contracted the virus from an unknown person who would have been infected earlier than him. Shane shared his belief he might have contracted the virus in Italy or in the Middle East, which, if true, would provide more evidence of early global spread. However, it\u2019s also possible he contracted the virus in California. Shane\u2019s claim was posted in the moderated New York Times\u2019 comments section, meaning one or more Times employees were aware of Shane\u2019s startling claim. Any Covid article, including the popular reader comments, published by the New York Times was also I would imagine read by at least some employees of the CDC, NIH etc. As only paid subscribers can make comments in the New York Times comment section, the newspaper possesses Shane\u2019s subscription information. That is, someone at the newspaper could have easily ascertained Shane\u2019s full name and contact information, including his street and email address. For what it\u2019s worth, I contacted the NY Times via its news tip email address and suggested a reporter follow up on Shane\u2019s eye-opening claim. I did not receive a reply. This leads me to believe the New York Times is not interested in pursuing evidence of early spread in America, even in the case of a person who very well could be the first known Covid case in the world. Conclusion At least three Americans (either known, or in Shane\u2019s case, easily identifiable if effort was made) possessed antibody evidence of Covid in November 2019. The infection chain that ultimately produced these symptomatic individuals likely traces to October 2019. Of note, two of these individuals received two positive antibody tests, making a false positive explanation far less likely. These cases occurred not in one state, but three states (New Jersey, Florida and California). Per my research, Americans from at least 12 U.S. states had antibody evidence of infection prior to mid-January 2020. As far as I know, none of these 123 Americans (17 Americans identified in press reports and 106 in the Red Cross antibody study) had travelled to China. All 123 are either known or could be identified. (For unstated reasons, the CDC did not interview any of the 106 Americans who provided positive blood samples to the Red Cross.) The figure 123 does not include the unknown individuals who infected these Americans, nor does it include the possible cases that never became known to reporters or the public. This antibody evidence strongly suggests the novel coronavirus was being transmitted person-to-person throughout the United States well before January 1st 2020, and was probably occurring by October 2019. If certain officials concealed this truth or were simply too incompetent to figure it out, any trust placed in such authorities is undermined. The above information also suggests that officials are not interested in conducting serious investigations into early spread of the virus, prompting a sceptic to wonder why this might be the case. My hope is that journalists with more resources than myself, as well as officials and scientists, will belatedly and seriously investigate the strangely-ignored evidence of early spread.

        "text":"\u201cOnly one year ago, it would have been unthinkable to witness a legal war between Pfizer and Moderna over the patent of the Covid graphene vaccine. One year later, we witness a war within the Bill Gates pharmaceutical cartel. This is the confirmation that Davos has completely lose [sic] control. This is the confirmation that Davos has received a tremendous defeat.\u201d This is what Italian geopolitical commentator Cesare Sacchetti has to say on this topic (Telegram, August 27, 2022): ER Editor: So vaccine companies can sue each other but we can\u2019t sue them. Miss a day, miss a lot. Subscribe to The Defender\u2019s Top News of the Day. It\u2019s free. Moderna today filed patent infringement lawsuits against Pfizer and BioNTech, alleging the two companies copied Moderna\u2019s patented mRNA technology and claiming neither of the companies possessed the necessary know-how to have produced the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine on their own. In a statement, Moderna alleged the two companies infringed on patents Moderna filed between 2010 and 2016. Moderna, based in Cambridge, Mass., filed its lawsuit against Pfizer in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. It sued Germany-based BioNTech in the Regional Court of D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. Though Moderna has been in existence for only a decade, the company is considered \u201can innovator in the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology that enabled the unprecedented speed in developing the COVID-19 vaccine,\u201d according to Reuters. However, in an interview with The Defender, Dr. Robert Malone, who helped develop the mRNA technology used in COVID-19 vaccines and who has become an outspoken critic of the vaccines and pandemic countermeasures, suggested the Moderna lawsuit may represent only the tip of the iceberg, in relation to legal disputes over patents. Moderna: Pfizer and BioNTech used patented technology without permission Remarking on the lawsuit, Moderna CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel said in a statement: \u201cWe are filing these lawsuits to protect the innovative mRNA technology platform that we pioneered, invested billions of dollars in creating, and patented during the decade preceding the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cThis foundational platform, which we began building in 2010, along with our patented work on coronaviruses in 2015 and 2016, enabled us to produce a safe and highly effective Covid-19 vaccine in record time after the pandemic struck.\u201d According to the statement, \u201cPfizer and BioNTech copied two key features of Moderna\u2019s patented technologies which are critical to the success of mRNA vaccines.\u201d The BBC explained that one type of infringement alleged by Moderna involves \u201can mRNA structure that Moderna says its scientists began developing in 2010 and were the first to validate in human trials in 2015.\u201d The second infringement claimed by Moderna \u201cinvolves the coding of the spike protein on the outside of the [COVID-19] virus itself,\u201d the BBC reported. \u201cWhen COVID-19 emerged, neither Pfizer nor BioNTech had Moderna\u2019s level of experience with developing mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases, and they knowingly followed Moderna\u2019s lead in developing their own vaccine,\u201d Moderna claimed in its statement. Moderna also claimed Pfizer and BioNTech tested candidate COVID-19 vaccines that did not use technology Moderna claims violates its copyright, but ultimately opted not to develop them. According to Moderna: \u201cFirst, Pfizer and BioNTech took four different vaccine candidates into clinical testing, which included options that would have steered clear of Moderna\u2019s innovative path. \u201cPfizer and BioNTech, however, ultimately decided to proceed with a vaccine that has the same exact mRNA chemical modification to its vaccine as Spikevax\u00ae.\u201d Pfizer and BioNTech then copied the spike protein Moderna originally developed. Moderna said: \u201cSecond, and again despite having many different options, Pfizer and BioNTech copied Moderna\u2019s approach to encode for the full-length spike protein in a lipid nanoparticle formulation for a coronavirus. \u201cModerna scientists developed this approach when they created a vaccine for the coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) years before COVID-19 first emerged.\u201d \u201cAlthough the MERS vaccine never went to market, its development helped Moderna rapidly roll out its COVID-19 vaccine,\u201d according to Reuters. Moderna said none of the patent rights it is seeking to enforce are related to intellectual property it developed as a result of its collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for the development of COVID-19 treatments. Moderna received $2.5 billion in taxpayer funding to support the development of its COVID-19 vaccine, The New York Times reported. Moderna, in October 2020, \u201cpledged not to enforce its COVID-19 related [sic] patents while the pandemic continued,\u201d according to the company\u2019s statement. However, the company said it \u201cupdated\u201d its pledge on March 7, 2022, \u201cwhen the collective fight against COVID-19 entered a new phase and vaccine supply was no longer a barrier to access in many parts of the world.\u201d As part of this \u201cupdated\u201d pledge, Moderna \u201cmade clear that while it would never enforce its patents for any COVID-19 vaccine used in the 92 low- and middle-income countries in the GAVI COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC92),\u201d the company \u201cexpected companies such as Pfizer and BioNTech to respect its intellectual property rights.\u201d Moderna said it \u201cwould consider a commercially reasonable license\u201d if requested by other companies, but added, \u201cPfizer and BioNTech have failed to do so.\u201d Shannon Thyme Klinger, Moderna\u2019s chief legal officer, said, \u201cPfizer and BioNTech unlawfully copied Moderna\u2019s invention, and that they have continued to use them without permission.\u201d Based on the date the company updated its pledge \u2014 March 7 \u2014 Moderna said it is \u201cnot seeking damages for activities occurring before March 8, 2022,\u201d adding that it is \u201cnot seeking to remove Comirnaty\u00ae from the market \u2026 is not asking for an injunction to prevent its future sale [and] is not seeking damages related to Pfizer\u2019s sales to AMC92 countries.\u201d As of Friday morning, Pfizer had not responded to the allegations. A spokeswoman for the company, Jerica Pitts, said the company had not been served with a suit and was \u201cunable to comment at this time.\u201d Malone: \u2018Skirmish\u2019 between Moderna and Pfizer \u2018part of a larger effort to assert primacy in the mRNA vaccine domain by a variety of corporations\u2019 In an interview with The Defender, Malone characterized Moderna\u2019s lawsuit as \u201cpart of a larger ongoing dispute over the origins and patent coverage relevant to the mRNA vaccine technology\u201d \u2014 while accusing Moderna and others of failure to cite other prior patents, including his own. Malone said one of the patents under dispute in Moderna\u2019s lawsuit involves the \u201cdelivery and formulation of engineered nucleic acids.\u201d The other patents at the heart of the dispute between Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, according to Malone, \u201cinvolve broad claims concerning rights to express a full-length spike protein from any coronavirus using a modified mRNA approach.\u201d Malone said these patents are \u201calso at risk for re-examination due to being overly broad.\u201d He described the \u201cskirmish\u201d between Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech as being \u201cpart of a larger effort to assert primacy in the mRNA vaccine domain by a variety of corporations.\u201d At its root, the dispute is \u201creally an extension of the concerted effort previously made by BioNTech and UPenn [the University of Pennsylvania] to claim Katalin Karik\u00f3 and Drew Weissman as the original inventors of the [mRNA] technology,\u201d instead of himself, Malone said. He said this is transpiring \u201cas part of a press campaign advocating that [Karik\u00f3 and Weissman] receive the Nobel Prize for their work.\u201d Referring more broadly to Moderna\u2019s lawsuit, Malone said it is \u201cabout Moderna attempting to extract money from Pfizer-BioNTech on claims that involve at least one issued patent which clearly failed to cite relevant prior art, both in published literature and in issued U.S. patents.\u201d \u201cOne outcome of this lawsuit,\u201d said Malone, \u201cmay be that [one] patent is invalidated for failure to cite, and the other patents cited may be at risk for invalidation due to being overly broad.\u201d According to Reuters, legal disputes involving patents are \u201cnot uncommon in the early stages of new technology,\u201d adding that all of the companies involved in the suit are already embroiled in other lawsuits. For instance, Pfizer and BioNTech were sued for patent infringement by German company CureVac. In turn, The Verge reported, Moderna was sued by two biotechnology companies, Arbutus Biopharma and Genevant Sciences, \u201cover the method for packaging up the mRNA and delivering it to the body.\u201d Arbutus also succeeded in a previous patent infringement challenge against Moderna, in 2020. And all three companies involved in the latest lawsuit \u2014 Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna \u2014 were sued by another biotechnology company, Alnylam, over a similar technology. Moderna is also involved in a separate legal dispute with the NIH involving rights to mRNA technology. Bancel, in touting the importance of the mRNA technology for Moderna, went on to claim in the company\u2019s statement that Moderna \u201cis continuing to use the technology to develop treatments for influenza and HIV, as well as autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases and rare forms of cancer.\u201d Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine is the company\u2019s only commercial product \u2014 one that has delivered $10.4 billion in revenue, in contrast to the almost $22 billion in revenue Pfizer has generated from its COVID-19 vaccine. News of the lawsuit came amidst a recent report, on Aug. 24, that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is likely to approve updated versions of both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 boosters. Early reaction to the lawsuit on the part of investors was negative, with Pfizer shares falling 1.4% and BioNTech shares declining by about 2% in early morning trading before the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange. While the markets may be expressing some jitters in relation to Pfizer as a result of this lawsuit, for Malone, the main issue at hand comes back to the original development of mRNA technology \u2014 and who has, perhaps improperly, benefitted from it. Speaking in reference to patents related to mRNA technology, Malone told The Defender:",

        "text":"If it could be proven the virus that causes COVID-19 was spreading throughout the world by November 2019 (or even earlier), the shift in the Covid narrative might be seismic. For example, if the virus had already infected large numbers of people, the justification for the lockdowns of mid-March 2020 to \u2018slow or stop the spread\u2019 of a newly arrived virus would be shown to be nonsense. Estimates of the number of people who had already developed natural immunity as well as of the infection fatality rate (IFR) might be dramatically different. It would suggest the disease was not nearly as lethal as experts proclaimed. The mass fear in the public \u2013 a prerequisite for lockdowns and later for mass vaccinations \u2013 might be much lower. Given these points, it\u2019s odd public health officials and investigative journalists have eschewed serious investigations that might confirm this virus had already spread around the world before January 1st 2020. (ER: Yes it is, but well no, it\u2019s not really.) A commonsense project to \u2018prove\u2019 early spread was occurring would be simply to test tranches of blood that were donated before the birth date of the official outbreak (December 31st 2019). Surprisingly, however, very few antibody studies of archived blood collected before December 31st 2019 have occurred. Will Jones recently highlighted one such study published by researchers in France as well as a sewage study from Brazil. The first provides antibody evidence and the second RNA evidence the novel coronavirus was spreading by November 2019 in these countries. To Will\u2019s list, I\u2019d add the only antibody study of archived Red Cross blood conducted by the U.S. CDC to date. This study found 39 antibody-positive serum samples collected December 13th-16th 2019 in California, Washington and Oregon (2% of blood samples collected from these states tested positive for antibodies). As it takes the human body one to two weeks to produce detectable levels of antibodies, most of these 39 antibody-positive donors had been infected in November 2019 if not earlier. For some reason, American officials performed only one antibody study of blood collected by blood bank organisations. It\u2019s also strange that results of this study were not published until November 30th 2020 \u2013 more than 11 months after the first tranche of archived Red Cross blood had been collected. In a CDC press briefing held May 29th 2020, CDC officials stated they\u2019d searched for and could find no evidence the novel coronavirus had been \u201cintroduced\u201d anywhere in America prior to January 20th 2020. I believe this statement was false as by the time this press briefing was held, copious evidence of early spread had already been disseminated via published news accounts. For example, I\u2019ve identified at least 17 Americans who were sick with definite Covid symptoms in November and December 2019 and all 17 had antibody evidence of prior infection. Also, all 17 of these reports were published by prominent news organisations at least 13 days before this press conference. While a source of important evidence, antibody studies are not necessary to prove that early spread almost certainly occurred in America. Close examination of individual case histories also allows one confidently to reach this conclusion. What follows is a summary of three individual histories that lead me to conclude community spread was already occurring in America by November 2019 and probably October 2019. For details on other American cases that date to December 2019, see this Seattle Times story and a feature story I wrote that, for some reason, was completely ignored by the mainstream press and public health officials, a fact I document in this follow-up article. Case 1: Michael Melham of Belleville, NJ Michael Melham, the Mayor of Belleville, NJ, was among a large group of New Jersey municipal employees who attended a conference in Atlantic City on November 19th-21st 2019. While at the conference, Melham experienced symptoms common to COVID-19. \u201cI was definitely feeling sick when I was there, and fought my way through it,\u201d Mayor Melham told NJ Advance Media on April 30th 2020. \u201cI have never been sicker in my entire life,\u201d the Mayor said. \u201cThese symptoms included a 102-degree fever, chills, hallucinations and a sore throat that lasted for three weeks.\u201d In a story published by Fox News, Mayor Melham said the illness made him feel \u201clike a heroin addict going through withdrawals\u2026 I didn\u2019t know what was happening to me. I never felt that I could be so sick\u201c. Mayor Melham felt sick enough to contact his doctor who diagnosed him with the flu. However, this diagnosis was given \u201cover the phone\u201d and Melham never actually received a flu test. In late April 2020, Melham visited his doctor for his annual physical and brought up his November illness. The doctor administered an antibody test, which came back positive for Covid antibodies. Melham later told me he actually received two positive antibody tests (previous reports mentioned just one). \u201cMy first antibody test was a rapid test. My second was a blood test that was sent to a lab. Both were positive for the longer antibody,\u201d Mayor Melham wrote in one email. Mayor Melham has repeatedly made the important (if ignored) point that he tested positive for the \u2018long\u2019 (IgG) antibody. He tested negative for the IgM antibody. The presence of IgM antibodies indicate more recent infection and, per studies, these antibodies fade and are only detectable for about a month after infection. This combination of antibody results would seem to rule out the possibility Mayor Melham experienced an asymptomatic case of Covid in the month before receiving his first antibody test. The only time Melham was sick was November 2020. He added: \u201cI will also tell you that since the media attention surrounding my claim, many others have come forward. I have emails from those who were actually at the same conference in Atlantic City NJ, who became just as sick as I was.\u201d Those who wish to gauge the credibility of the Mayor\u2019s claims can view this four-minute YouTube interview with Mayor Melham. I also asked Mayor Melham a question no other journalist seems to have asked him. \u201cDid any public health official ever contact you to investigate your possible case?\u201d Melham\u2019s email response: \u201cNo, nothing.\u201d Multiple acquaintances as well as his physician would confirm Melham was sick with symptoms common to Covid victims in November. Since he received two positive antibody tests, if the results were a false positive, he received two false positives. As noted, Mayor Melham reports receiving emails from \u201cmultiple people\u2026 who were at the same conference who became just as sick as I was\u201d. This would suggest the presence of community spread \u2013 a possibility which might have been confirmed if contact tracers had tested the people who\u2019d been sick at the same conference for antibodies. We know no public health officials contacted Mayor Melham to investigate his claim. We also know, thanks to nj.com\u2018s reporting, that state health officials were aware of his claim: Asked about the Mayor\u2019s statements, the state health department declined comment. A spokesperson for Gov. Phil Murphy did not immediately respond to a message. The following points should also be emphasised. If his diagnosis had been confirmed by public health officials, Mayor Melham would have been the first known Covid case in the world, and would have been the first confirmed case in America by approximately 61 days (the first official case in America is still recorded as January 20th 2020 \u2013 a man from Washington state who had recently returned from Wuhan). Significantly, Mayor Melham can date the onset of his symptoms. Per numerous studies, it takes two to 14 days after infection for symptoms to manifest. This means Mayor Melham would have been infected some time between November 5th and November 19th 2019. Since Mayor Melham did not give the virus to himself, logic tells us the chain of transmission that ended with Michael Melham being symptomatic around November 20th 2019 very possibly began before November 1st 2019. This would mean that community spread was possibly occurring in New Jersey as early as October 2019. Case 2: Uf Tukel of Delray Beach, Florida As reported by Palm Beach Post on May 16th 2020: At least 11 people\u2026 on two small blocks alone\u2026 in a small Delray Beach (Florida) neighborhood tested positive for coronavirus antibodies in April. They felt symptoms as early as November (2019). \u201cIt didn\u2019t have a name back then, but I have no doubt now that it was the coronavirus,\u201d one neighbour said. The article names seven of these individuals and provides details and quotes about their symptoms. These seven people include Uf Tukel who was \u201cfirst among (residents of the neighborhood) to feel sick in late November (2019)\u2026 For weeks, he had body aches, a severe cough and night sweats\u201d. While \u201cTukel is reluctant to say he had the coronavirus a month before Chinese officials reported the outbreak to the World Health Organisation, \u2018I had all the symptoms though,\u2019 Tukel said.\u201d The same logic applied to Michael Melham\u2019s possible case would apply to Mr. Tukel\u2019s possible case. That is, whoever first infected Mr. Tukel was infected earlier than Tukel was, suggesting early spread was also happening by some point in November, if not October, in Delray Beach, Florida. If confirmed, Mr. Tukel\u2019s case would indicate that American cases in November were not isolated to the state of New Jersey. Several other points included in the Post\u2019s coverage deserve attention. These possible DelRay Beach cases include two couples, with one spouse presumably infecting the other. One child of one of these couples became infected, providing further evidence of community spread. According to the story, none of the individuals experienced close contacts with other non-family residents of the same neighbourhood. That is, there seems to be no evidence of neighbour-to-neighbour transmission. According to the story, \u201call (11 individuals) recovered and haven\u2019t been sick since\u201d. None of the 11 had travelled to China. Like Michael Melham, none of these 11 people tested positive for the \u2018short\u2019 (IgM) antibodies \u2013 thus none had been recently infected. The Post article also includes this eye-opening information: \u201cSince March (2020) about two-fifths (approximately 200, 40%) of the 500 antibody tests taken by Xera Med (a DelRay Beach private testing lab\/medical clinic) have been positive, said CEO Emily Rentz.\u201d The first two confirmed cases in Florida were recorded March 1st. The following sentence from this article might be even more significant: \u201cThe lab shares its data on positive tests with the state health department, (Rentz) added.\u201d And from the same article: \u201cThe state wouldn\u2019t say whether it is collecting antibody data from hospitals or private laboratories.\u201d The Post article referenced a May 5th article by the same newspaper: In Florida, health department reports show patients who eventually tested positive for the virus experienced symptoms as early as January. The Florida Department of Health hasn\u2019t explained those potential fault lines in the state\u2019s assertion that the first cases didn\u2019t appear in Florida until March. The fact 40% of 500 antibody tests administered by the clinic between March and early May 2020 tested positive for Covid antibodies suggests infections were widespread in this community. And according to the CEO of this lab, these antibody results were being shared with Florida State Department of Health officials. And apparently these weren\u2019t the only positive antibody results that were being reported by testing labs. As reported in the same article: The University of Miami, in randomly testing Miami-Dade County residents for antibodies, has found that the rate of infection could be 16 times higher than state data suggests, said Dr. Erin Kobetz, a professor and lead researcher on the project\u2026 Since first publishing her findings, Kobetz has heard from several people who shared experiences similar to the Tropic Isle neighbours\u2026 They described being sick in December and later testing positive for antibodies. They asked if what they\u2019d experienced was COVID-19. Significantly, if we count possible December 2019 cases, these are Americans from five widely-dispersed U.S. states whose stories were featured in published articles. An unknown number of Americans who\u2019ve never been featured in a newspaper article undoubtedly fit the same profile. If one adds this unknown number of never-identified people to the list of known individuals, evidence the novel coronavirus was spreading widely across America in November and December 2019 becomes even more compelling. Not every infectious disease expert agrees with the CDC\u2019s assessment that widespread transmission did not begin until January 20th 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that the disease spread as early as November,\u201d Dr. Kobetz said. As in New Jersey, apparently no official with the Florida Department of Health contacted any of the 11 people referenced in the Post\u2019s article. Nor have public health officials apparently followed up with Emily Renz, CEO of Xera Med, who stated approximately 200 other local residents received positive Covid antibody tests at the clinic between March and the end of April. Ms. Renz noted that information on all of these positive test results had been forwarded to officials at the state\u2019s health agency. Which prompts this question: How many clinics and testing labs in America also forwarded positive antibody test results to state health agencies, agencies which presumably could and would pass this information along to their colleagues at the CDC or NIH? What the public doesn\u2019t know but should is how many other Americans \u2013 those whose lab results were not reported in the press \u2013 also tested positive for antibodies between March and early May 2020. Presumably, the CDC and state and local health agencies have these data, which have never been released to the public. Indeed, I\u2019ve come to believe it\u2019s possible at least some high-ranking officials may have conspired to suppress antibody results which, if published, might have led the public to conclude this virus was spreading widely months before officials said it had been introduced in this country. Such knowledge might have changed the way tens of millions of Americans evaluated their personal Covid risk as well as their support for lockdowns. Case 3: Shane from Marin County, California Perhaps the first early case in America (with antibody evidence that would confirm infection) is Shane of Marin County, California. Shane\u2019s possible early case was not featured in a newspaper article, but by Shane himself in the reader comments section that followed a May 7th 2020 New York Times story (the story describes symptoms experienced by Covid patients). Writes Shane: \u201cI had COVID-19 last fall, far earlier than anyone else I\u2019ve heard of. I suspect I caught it while on an overseas trip to Italy and the Middle East \u2013 I\u2019ve taken two antibody tests in the past month, both of which confirmed I was infected.\u201d As Shane recounts, he was extremely sick with signature Covid symptoms. For me the worst symptom by far was the dry, unproductive cough. The cough was so intense, so relentless, it left me with bruised ribs and a horrible searing pain in my chest, which also felt as if someone were sitting on it. The fever at one point reach 104.9 upon which I began hallucinating \u2013 seeing my dogs talking to me and forgetting how to open a sliding glass door. Horrible chills which led to my teeth chattering so hard my jaw ached were also another noxious gift of Covid. What I most remember about my experience with Covid is pain, pain from coughing, pain in my body and head, pain everywhere around me, like a smothering red blanket. At times I felt I was going to die during that week and even today I must admit I am surprised I didn\u2019t. Adding credibility to his claim, Shane\u2019s post cited two labs where he claims to have received his positive antibody tests. The local health centre in West Marin is where I took the latest one. The other one I took directly at the manufacturer\u2019s location \u2013 ARCpoint Labs in Richmond. That one is only 87% accurate and not FDA approved so that\u2019s why I took the more recent one, which was done through Quest Labs I believe. In the comment thread, one poster suggests it\u2019s unlikely Shane developed Covid as there had been no reported confirmed cases from that time. This poster opines that Shane was sick with some other nasty virus and later developed an asymptomatic case of Covid. However, Shane stuck to his theory and presented reasons for his opinion. I suppose it\u2019s possible but I tend to think that since what I contracted had the exact same symptoms as COVID-19 \u2013 that COVID-19 is what I had. In addition, mid-February through mid-March I was in isolation, caring for my sister who died mid-March from metastatic cervical cancer. When COVID-19 made its first appearance in the U.S. in February we very quickly put in strict isolation protocols as my sister had a compromised immune system due to chemotherapy, further insulating myself from contact and infection as well. Shane does not report what month he thinks he had Covid \u2013 only that it was \u201clast fall\u2026 and far earlier than anyone else I\u2019ve heard.\u201d He could have been sick in November, but maybe even in October. Shane (if he really had Covid) contracted the virus from an unknown person who would have been infected earlier than him. Shane shared his belief he might have contracted the virus in Italy or in the Middle East, which, if true, would provide more evidence of early global spread. However, it\u2019s also possible he contracted the virus in California. Shane\u2019s claim was posted in the moderated New York Times\u2019 comments section, meaning one or more Times employees were aware of Shane\u2019s startling claim. Any Covid article, including the popular reader comments, published by the New York Times was also I would imagine read by at least some employees of the CDC, NIH etc. As only paid subscribers can make comments in the New York Times comment section, the newspaper possesses Shane\u2019s subscription information. That is, someone at the newspaper could have easily ascertained Shane\u2019s full name and contact information, including his street and email address. For what it\u2019s worth, I contacted the NY Times via its news tip email address and suggested a reporter follow up on Shane\u2019s eye-opening claim. I did not receive a reply. This leads me to believe the New York Times is not interested in pursuing evidence of early spread in America, even in the case of a person who very well could be the first known Covid case in the world. Conclusion At least three Americans (either known, or in Shane\u2019s case, easily identifiable if effort was made) possessed antibody evidence of Covid in November 2019. The infection chain that ultimately produced these symptomatic individuals likely traces to October 2019. Of note, two of these individuals received two positive antibody tests, making a false positive explanation far less likely. These cases occurred not in one state, but three states (New Jersey, Florida and California). Per my research, Americans from at least 12 U.S. states had antibody evidence of infection prior to mid-January 2020. As far as I know, none of these 123 Americans (17 Americans identified in press reports and 106 in the Red Cross antibody study) had travelled to China. All 123 are either known or could be identified. (For unstated reasons, the CDC did not interview any of the 106 Americans who provided positive blood samples to the Red Cross.) The figure 123 does not include the unknown individuals who infected these Americans, nor does it include the possible cases that never became known to reporters or the public. This antibody evidence strongly suggests the novel coronavirus was being transmitted person-to-person throughout the United States well before January 1st 2020, and was probably occurring by October 2019. If certain officials concealed this truth or were simply too incompetent to figure it out, any trust placed in such authorities is undermined. The above information also suggests that officials are not interested in conducting serious investigations into early spread of the virus, prompting a sceptic to wonder why this might be the case. My hope is that journalists with more resources than myself, as well as officials and scientists, will belatedly and seriously investigate the strangely-ignored evidence of early spread.

        "text":"It\u2019s April 2020, and since March, the UK has swiftly commissioned and built vast, temporary, intensive care hospitals, in readiness for a predicted epidemic number of severe COVID-19 cases. They are called NHS Nightingale Hospitals, and to date there are seven of them, either open or planned. The first one was announced on 24 March by the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, and was opened almost immediately on 3 April at the London Excel Centre. It has a capacity of some 4,000 beds. The other temporary field hospital sites are in Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Bristol, Exeter, Harrogate, and Washington. Additionally, over the last month, some 8,000 beds in private hospitals have been re-assigned for Covid-19 use, along with other NHS beds in hospitals all over the UK. By the beginning of April, one third of all non-ICU NHS beds had been converted into potential ICU beds for possible Covid-19 patients. Yet, by 12 April, the London Nightingale had treated just 19 patients, and to date, only 41 patients have been treated. This sudden blitz is both unusual and unprecedented. We regularly have seasonal infectious illnesses spread throughout the population; in fact in recent years, some of these epidemic diseases were also predicted well in advance. Yet no new mega-hospitals, temporary or otherwise, were ever built to cope with them, nor were they seen to be needed. Why now? According to the King\u2019s Fund, over the last thirty years, the number of ICU beds has declined, at a time when the population has risen. Over that period, around 34% of general and critical care beds in England have been lost. Peter Donaghy, an independent data analyst, reports that the UK now comes near the bottom of the world league in the number of hospital beds per head of population: in 2019, and across the four UK nations, he found that there are about 5.7 ICU beds per 100,000 of the population [interpolation of his figures mine]. Cyprus has double that number, Germany has 29, the USA 34, and even Kazakhstan and Mongolia do better than the UK. Bed shortages are not news, however. In 2008, it was revealed that 32,000 beds of all types had been cut in the decade since 1997, when, ironically, the Blair government came into power on a ticket of increasing the number of hospital beds. Between 2010 and 2017 there were 70,000 fewer intensive care beds in the UK: In 2016, the Royal College of Surgeons had complained of chronic bed shortages, so much so that the occupancy rates had gone beyond 89%, when 85% is considered the maximum safe level. This complaint was made just before the British Medical Association chimed in, reporting on the shortage of beds being more severe than in other Western countries, and that such overcrowding can lead to the spread of infections. And in 2018, the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine (FICM) astonishingly reported that across the UK, 80% of intensive care units were sending patients to other hospitals, either because of a lack of beds or a shortage of staff, particularly nurses. To cap things off, by 2019, it was being reported by the British Medical Association that ICU beds had begun to be used for patients recovering from routine operations, and that when more emergency beds were needed, a policy of \u201cescalation beds\u201d came into force. The BMA drily reported that there was \u201clittle sign of this practice ending\u201d. When one thinks of the NHS, intensive care is at the heart of most people\u2019s perceptions of it. Yet the decline in the number of ICU beds over the last 30 years is so counterintuitive that it\u2019s as if some monster deus ex machina has intervened and decided not only that the general numbers of hospital beds are of little import, but that intensive care beds are even more expendable. But whatever the case, in the event of a mass epidemic, the consequences of ICU bed shortages were indeed grim prior to 2020. What official policies have the post-Blair governments been maintaining throughout this decline in the number of ICU beds? To get a general feel, looking back to 2011, the government published the UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy Paper, outlining what the official response to a hypothetical pandemic should be. This paper appears to have been written largely in response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak. Its precautionary approach stresses that actions following the emergence of a pandemic, which could occur suddenly at any time: must be evidence based be proportional to the level of threat be flexible be based on ethical principles. emergency powers must last no longer than 30 days Significantly, it states that during any pandemic, it should be \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d and notes that its recommendations are in line with an earlier, 2007, National Framework paper\u2019s \u201cdefence in depth\u201d approach to a pandemic. The Pandemic Preparedness Strategy Paper also makes clear that military personnel are not to be redeployed during a pandemic, but must remain on their normal defence duties. So of course, this means that they were not to be used to help build vast temporary hospitals, transport patients, or manage the public. Military convoy off the coast at Devonport on the morning of 23 March, the day Boris Johnson announced the lockdown In fact, the paper is silent on any hospital bed policies; it takes it as read that there would be enough UK ICU beds for the treatment of pandemic disease patients \u2013 for in 2009\u2019s H1N1 swine flu outbreak, generally, hospitals may have just coped with finding enough beds for acute H1N1 patients. There were 540,000 cases of swine flu in England, and 138 fatalities at the time, or 0.026% of those infected. Exercise Cygnus Following the publication of the 2011 preparedness paper, however, the number of ICU beds continued to fall. Then, five years later, government held an unusual and secretive event called Exercise Cygnus. It involved all government departments, all local authorities, and the NHS, right across the UK. Its report has not been published for \u201cnational security reasons\u201d and so as not to \u201cfrighten the public\u201d. However, according to those with first-hand knowledge of the operation, Cygnus\u2019 script contained a scenario of a patent lack of capacity in ICU beds and personal protective equipment. Based on its given hypotheses, it predicted that thousands more critical care beds would be required, large parts of the NHS would need to be switched off to redeploy staff, frail patients would be denied care, and mortuaries would be overwhelmed. Was this just an experiment to see how the public sector actors involved would react to each other, like some kind of Grand Guignol? Did the exercise take its inspiration from the memorably twisted 2012 London Olympics ceremony, in which rows of thousands of NHS patients in hospital beds, in a dark auditorium looking like a Nightingale Hospital, were danced around by strange beasts and actors wearing scrubs? The modelling of Cygnus was done by Imperial College, London, under the aegis of Neil Ferguson, who is also now doing the modelling of Covid-19. Tellingly, it is said that last month\u2019s Coronavirus Act, the emergency legislation which underpins the lockdown, is based on his modelling in Exercise Cygnus. Ferguson\u2019s involvement in the Coronavirus crisis does raise other questions \u2013 for further coverage see Vanessa Beeley\u2019s article: Who controls the British Government response to Covid\u201319? Outside of the strange artificial world of Exercise Cygnus, the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Surgeons continued to complain about bed shortages. So why was there no turnaround policy introduced at least by 2016 after these professional outcries? The Health Secretary at the time was Jeremy Hunt. Simon Stevens was Chief of NHS England. Both had been involved in cutting bed numbers. Yet, since 2016, and prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, with Sir Simon Stevens still at the helm, there appears to have been no general improvement in ICU bed capacity. Following Exercise Cygnus, in 2017, the NHS Board published a short internal paper called Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response (EPRR). Its approach is centred on three Acts of Parliament: the Civil Contingencies Act (2004), the NHS Act (2006), and the Health and Social Care Act (2012). Drawn up by Director of Operations and Information for the NHS Board, Matthew Swindells (sic), it asks the Board to agree that progress had been made in EPRR over the last year, and that the NHS was in a state of pandemic readiness. EPRR was rubber stamped, but as we have seen above, the somewhat rosy, self-congratulatory picture that was approved by the NHS Board was shown to be completely incorrect by Statista in 2017, and later, by the Faculty of Intensive Care in 2018, the BMA in 2019, and Peter Donaghy in 2020. Back to Exercise Cygnus. This was supposed to be merely a computer simulation. So why would it be an issue of \u201cnational security\u201d? Why would it \u201cfrighten the public\u201d? Perhaps because it was intended to change the real world into its simulated image? It\u2019s an uncanny coincidence that, after the Coronavirus pandemic was declared, it was announced that there were not enough ICU beds or personal protective equipment, that NHS staff have been redeployed to other areas, that hospitalised elderly patients have been denied care through the use of \u201cDo Not Resuscitate\u201d orders, and large, temporary, mortuaries have also been built up and down the country, just as in the simulation. Temporary mortuary set up in Ernesettle Fort, Plymouth Since the first reported UK Covid-19 case, there has been non-stop media coverage propagandising the numbers of cases and deaths, and its threat. All the while, there have been regular reports that many ICU beds are empty, that beds of other sorts are empty, and that although accident and emergency visits are down, people with serious conditions telephoning the NHS advice and triage number, are being told to \u201cStay at home \u2013 Save the NHS \u2013 Save Lives\u201d. Many of these callers have then died for lack of care. It has also emerged that standards in death registration have been lowered by the government, and that there has been encouragement to register anyone who dies, of any underlying condition, as a Covid-19 death. There need be no objective verification of the existence of Covid-19 to register a death as being caused by it. Despite these efforts to inflate the death rate, actual mortality rates since the beginning of this crisis do not show that we are in the middle of a pandemic, and actual critical case numbers are not overwhelming the NHS's depleted intensive care units. In that regard, Covid-19 is not mirroring Exercise Cygnus\u2019 computer-generated scenario. The government response, however, seems to match it exactly.",

        "text":"We publish the below anonymously for self-evident reasons. I wrote an article for UK Column a year ago which accused legacy media newspaper proprietors of being criminally negligent for allowing Covid disinformation and fear-based propaganda in their titles. Since that time, levels of hatred have increased against journalists who operate in this industry that I myself have been part of for a quarter of a century. In this second anonymous whistleblower account of what it is like to work in UK newspapers during the Covid era, I hope to direct some of that hatred away from the journalists and to refocus it on the newspaper industry chiefs who serve Big Pharma before truth. Censorship? What censorship? Nearly all of the journalists I know are completely unaware of global censorship; they are often new in their roles and are thrust into a working world of increasingly aggressive public relations officers. One community reporter, whom I class as a friend, listened to my concerns about tech giants censoring scientists and health professionals who went against World Health Organisation guidelines for the alleged pandemic. This reporter\u2019s wages are paid for by Facebook, so I was expecting they would be aware of this, but they responded with: \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d Add to this ignorance the chronic levels of understaffing we endure, with redundancies being announced most years across all editorial departments, and we have an industry where press releases are pumped out without challenge. As an example of this, I had one editor ask me to upload directly onto our newspaper website an NHS press release urging pregnant women to take the Covid injection, as it was \u201csafe and effective\u201d. This same editor was too fearful to return to the office early this year, even though others were coming back in, so I genuinely believe the editor thought the press release was nothing more than legitimate public health advice. In sum, the entire backbone has been ripped out of the news industry\u2014and that happened more than a decade ago. And we are dealing with clueless individuals who work within it, many of them programmed to be \u201cwoke\u201d by their \u201ctrusted\u201d news sources like the BBC and the Guardian, but do they deserve our hate and scorn? At the time of writing my last whistleblower account, I was angry, frustrated and scared about where the world was heading and how my industry was pushing it there. I hated my colleagues for their ignorance and their blind faith in authority. But after another year of continuing to take pay cheques from what I still believe is the PR unit for globalist billionaires, I have become sorry for these foot soldiers who have caused so much harm by failing to challenge authority. And I fear for them as well. Bewitched It won\u2019t be long before a British journalist is physically hurt (if it hasn\u2019t happened already) for their role in what has happened in the Covid era, and I have experienced some of this public hatred towards journalists myself. During a recent public meeting highlighting the documented life-changing harm and death caused by the Pfizer Covid injections, I had some audience members turn on me, shouting that I was a disgrace and that I should quit my job when I announced that I worked in the mainstream media. If it had not been for a senior local politician, who knows me, speaking up for my integrity, I would have had to have made a sharp exit for my own safety. The mainstream news has become one of the country's most hated professions during the last two years, especially among those who have either recently learned or already knew not to trust authority on global issues. Having now returned to the office on a sporadic basis, I have had the chance to speak face-to-face with colleagues for the first time in more than a year\u2014and it has dawned on me how ignorant they are. They are not stupid, they are not controlled opposition, they are not just being told what to write, they are just completely unaware of any counter-narratives about Covid. They are under a spell, a spell of remarkable simplicity that has just two elements\u2014censorship and propaganda\u2014which brings about the end product of fear. Most of my colleagues are fairly low down in the editorial structure of the global mainstream behemoth, but they represent a microcosm of what is happening further along the corridors of power. This hierarchical consideration goes some way to explain the absolute ignorance among those reporting the news. There is a handful of my colleagues who are aware that the human race is being railroaded into a new world order controlled by technocrats. A few others are starting to realise that politicians have no problems lying to us about the most important global issues. This second group, although aware of something bad happening around them, recoil at the thought of a global conspiracy to enslave humanity. When discussing Covid, especially, they make it clear they do not subscribe to conspiracy theories and are not conspiracy theorists. These comments are made because they are fearful their reputations could be harmed by discussing Covid through the lens of holding authority to account, following the money, and asking who benefits. I have noticed that mainstream media managers are far more fearful of being branded a \u201cconspiracy theorist\u201d than a reporter. And I know of one reporter who was branded the \u201coffice conspiracy theorist\u201d for writing an article detailing a woman\u2019s Covid injection harm. Some of my colleagues I also count as friends, and many of them I still have not seen since our offices were shut down across the country more than two years ago. But recently we have been returning to our desks\u2014which we have to book online beforehand\u2014and this has allowed me to be able to speak to some of them and to look them in the eye as I hear their thoughts about what has been going on. It has been a shocking experience, and disheartening. The propaganda pumped out by the Government, and regurgitated by the national newspapers and television news networks, has done a good job of scaring them\u2014to such an extent that real psychological trauma has been caused to some of them. Several colleagues have admitted to me they are \u201cpro-vax\u201d and are worried about any \"messaging\" that could reduce Covid injection uptake. Another just felt it was their \u201ccivic duty\u201d to receive all their injections, and thought no more about it. One colleague even messaged me to urge me to be injected, as they were so worried for my wellbeing. Some months later, I provided that colleague with evidence from the Office for National Statistics of the increased levels of death among those who did get injected, and I urged them not to continue taking any Covid boosters offered. I received no response. Cloud of unknowing More shocking examples of ignorance came from a colleague who told me how fortunate it was that a reporter we worked with had been triple injected, as they had become seriously ill with Covid. No connection between the injections and becoming ill was made. This same colleague had written an opinion piece some months earlier, pleading with people to continue taking their Covid injections, despite referencing a report of a woman dying in agony from blood clots\u2014after being injected\u2014which featured in that same day\u2019s newspaper. Is this cognitive dissonance? Mass formation? I don\u2019t pretend to know, but it is isolating and lonely to be working among these people who are so programmed by the television news. And they certainly do not like be challenged about their beliefs. I have done it, and have been victimised for it. One seasoned reporter who prided themselves on knowing the ways of the world was talking to me about the alleged pandemic. I asked them what they knew about midazolam, and they replied they had never heard of it. This censorship in the legacy media has left my colleagues and former colleagues blissfully unaware of Covid counter-narratives. Some truly believe in Bill Gates as a charitable benefactor for humanity and Chris Whitty as a responsible scientist looking to help guide the UK out of troubled waters. They are living in a different reality to myself and do not want to dip their toes in the information streams of those who disagree with them so fundamentally. As one colleague recently told me, they only get their information on global affairs from the mainstream media. I told her I didn\u2019t get any of my information on global affairs from the mainstream media. The conversation ended there. We were both so wrapped up in our own worlds that to even engage in debate with someone who thought so differently would be too uncomfortable. These types of people who build their understanding of the world from the television, radio and mainstream newspapers do not just work in the mainstream media. They exist in health, education, politics, councils, entertainment, sport, church, you name it. Whatever the sector of employment, there are people who trust those with the loudest microphones. But in the mainstream news, there are more of these people; a lot more. Careers in this industry depend on consuming other mainstream outlets: especially so at a local level, where \u201cnews sense\u201d is guided by what the national news is saying. Victims So here I am, a journalist of 25 years who has worked only in the mainstream news arena. I have been unable to wake up the vast majority of colleagues and have withdrawn into my shell, apart from occasional spats with them over e-mail or, on rare occasions, in person. I know what is going on in the world and they don\u2019t. I have been restricted from writing about what I know about, or even to ask questions of authority that my editor does not want asked. I am not giving up, though; I am not walking away. I am staying at my post, as I know things are very likely to get worse; and when things get worse, more of my colleagues will start waking up, and I\u2019ll be here to guide them and point them towards official documents that they will know nothing about, since the national newspapers and the broadcast news have chosen to ignore them. Ask a journalist about what they know about PCR test cycle rates or a SPI-B Government document recommending the use fear-based propaganda in the media to turn civilians against each other, and you will just get a blank stare. A friend consoled me recently that the way to bring down an edifice of unchecked control that operates under the power of censorship and propaganda is to set just one mouse gnawing away at the foundations. Eventually, that one mouse becomes two, and then four, then eight, and so on. That is how we get out of this mess, from the bottom of whatever corporate pyramid we operate in. There is no point in hoping for change from above: as I can tell you with absolute certainty, and experience, it is not coming. Journalists whom I work with, trust, and respect, and have known for years are just as clueless about Covid now as they were at the start of 2020. Don\u2019t hate them; feel sorry for them. They are victims in all this. I concluded my last UK Column article with a plea: a plea to those who made the editorial decisions, to allow for debate. That plea was never answered, but I make another plea now, to the reporters, to those venturing out of the office to speak to those in authority, building contacts and getting the stories. (And above all else, keep an open mind.) My plea is this: Please, please, do not be afraid of asking difficult questions, and make it your business to seek out information that is being censored and then to decide for yourself whether that information has any validity. The fight against tyranny has to come from the bottom, not the top. Don\u2019t wait for a knight in shining armour; there isn\u2019t one coming. It is up to you\u2014the coalface journalist\u2014to get out there and hold authority to account. And then, perhaps, our industry will become less hated than it is today; it could even become a profession again.",

        "title":"Foundation Wants Behavioral Scientists To Come Up With More Convincing COVID Vaxx Narratives",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.zerohedge.com\/covid-19\/rockefeller-foundation-wants-behavioral-scientists-come-more-convincing-covid-vax",
        "text":"In yet another sign that the covid vaccination agenda of globalist institutions did not do quite as well as they had originally hoped, the Rockefeller Foundation has revealed that it (along with other non-profits) has been pumping millions of dollars into a behavioral science project meant to figure out why large groups of people around the world refuse to take the jab. The \u201cMercury Project\u201d is a collective of behavioral scientists formed by the Social Science Research Council (SSRC), a non-profit group which receives considerable funding from globalist organizations and governments. The stated goals of the project are rather non-specific, using ambiguous language and mission statements. However, the root intentions appear to be focused on using behavioral psychology and mass psychology elements to understand the global resistance to the recent covid compliance efforts. Mercury groups will be deployed in multiple nations and regions and will study vaccine refusal and the medical \u201cdisinformation\u201d that leads to it. They are operating with the intent to tailor vaccination narratives to fit different ethnic and political backgrounds, looking for the key to the gates of each cultural kingdom and convincing them to take the jab. The Rockefeller Foundation and the SSRC note: \u201cFollowing the characterization of inaccurate health information by the U.S. Surgeon General as an \u201curgent threat,\u201d and by the World Health Organization as an \u201cinfodemic,\u201d the SSRC issued a call for proposals to counter the growing global threats posed by public health mis- and disinformation and low Covid-19 vaccination rates, and received nearly 200 submissions from around the world. ...With Covid-19 prevalent and rapidly evolving everywhere, there is a pressing need to identify interventions with the potential to increase vaccination take-up.\u201d The SSRC and the Mercury Project are not only receiving funding from foundations, but also government based institutions. In June of 2022 the Mercury Project received another $20 million from the National Science Foundation, which claims to be an \u201cindependent\u201d agency of the United States government. Meaning, fabricating effective covid propaganda is becoming a money train for the small groups of behavioral researchers and psychologists that jump onboard. The purpose of the NSF partnership with the Mercury Project is outlined on the SSRC website: \u201cThis innovative partnership will support research teams seeking to evaluate online or offline interventions to increase Covid-19 vaccination demand and other positive health behaviors, including by targeting the producers and\/or consumers of inaccurate health information and\/or by increasing confidence in reliable health information.\u201d The Mercury Project lists these bullet points as their focus: \u201cFunded projects will provide evidence about what works\u2013and doesn\u2019t\u2013in specific places and for specific groups to increase Covid-19 vaccination take-up, including what is feasible on the ground and has the potential to be cost-effective at scale. Each of the 12 teams will have access to findings from the other teams while exploring interventions including, but not limited to: Conducting literacy training for secondary school students in partnership with local authorities to help students identify Covid-19 vaccine misinformation. Equipping trusted messengers with communication strategies to increase Covid-19 vaccination demand. Using social networks to share tailored, community-developed messaging to increase Covid-19 vaccination demand.\u201d In other words, their focus is propaganda, propaganda and propaganda. The very basis of the existence of the Mercury Project presupposes that individuals cannot be trusted to make up their own minds about the information they are exposed to, and that they must be molded to accept the mainstream narrative. It also presupposes that mainstream or establishment information is always trustworthy and unbiased. The widespread non-compliance against covid vaccination mandates despite extensive government pressure is perhaps one of the most underappreciated events of the past century. It is likely the reason why political elites and the corporate media went from a non-stop fear campaign against the public to almost no mention of covid within a matter of weeks. It was as if the populace was being put through two years of waterboarding and then one day the torture simply stopped without explanation. If vaccine passport laws had been implemented through western nations on the scale that governments and globalists were demanding, then the last vestiges of personal freedom would now be erased permanently. All individual rights would become privileges granted by authorities and contingent on your submission to whatever covid booster shots or medical procedures happen to be in vogue at the time. Think about it: If they had gotten what they wanted, the west would look exactly like China does right now, or worse, with no economic participation without an up-to-date covid pass. And, the threat still lingers. Why the Mercury Project feels the need to compose vaccine propaganda for a virus with a mere 0.23% median Infection Fatality Rate is not explained. And, if vaccination numbers from agencies like the CDC are accurate, then the population has already achieved herd immunity anyway (perhaps their numbers are not accurate?). Why are globalist groups so obsessed with 100% vaccination for covid? This is never explained. They will say it's all about saving lives, but if only 0.23% of people on average are at risk regardless of whether they are vaccinated or not, then public health is not really a believable explanation. It would seem that the Mercury Project's purpose is more about influencing people to vaccinate despite the science rather than in the name of science.",

        "title":"to the Past A Reemergence of Victorian Diseases Evans discovery of polio virus in a London sewer raises the spectres of many decades ago.",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.ukcolumn.org\/blogs\/back-to-the-past-a-reemergence-of-victorian-diseases",
        "text":"On Wednesday 22 June 2022, the United Kingdom declared a national incident after vaccine-induced poliovirus was found in sewage samples in North and East London. Wild polio currently exists in only two countries\u2014Pakistan and Afghanistan\u2014and was declared eradicated in the UK in 2003. We are told that positive sewage tests have been found since February 2022, which would suggest that scientists are looking at a hypothesis of \u2018ongoing transmission\u2019 around the country. But is polio the only unusual virus detected in the UK in the last six months, and was it entirely unexpected? Is it sheer coincidence that our very own MHRA is collaborating with the World Health Organisation's Polio Eradication Initiative and houses its polio laboratory at the heart of Britain's medicines regulation complex, at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation? Not surprising The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), in a March 2019 blog post written when the agency was still designated as Public Health England, warned that a resurgence of Victorian diseases was expected\u2014and that is exactly what we appear to be seeing now, according to current press releases. Professor Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, describes what we are seeing as \u2018chatter\u2019. \u2018Chatter\u2019 is the term regularly used by counter-terrorist officers (a not insignificant context, given that the UKHSA\u2019s new name combines the concepts of public health and national security) to describe the small signals that may signify some more major calamity on the horizon. Infectious disease prevention works in much the same way as counter-terrorism. Currently, we are being alerted that \u2018chatter\u2019 is getting louder; perhaps this increased volume stems from the heightened awareness of the risks since Covid-19. Even though we have seen the world strengthen its security systems, the world\u2019s best-known public health official, Professor Anthony Fauci, warns of a new \u2018pandemic era\u2019. Scabies, rickets, scarlet fever, whooping cough, tuberculosis and typhoid fever, amongst others, are returning to Western nations\u2014but not as we remember them. Some of these old terrors will return with a vengeance, as a new variant or strain. Will our old-fashioned belt-and-braces medications that we have come to rely on for so long be effective, if they even prove to be widely available? What is driving the spread of new, old and existing viruses\u2014or is it simply that we are searching every corner of the planet expecting to track down the next pandemic\u2014a case of seek and ye shall find? Perhaps we should brace ourselves, as the blame for resurgent infections is likely to be attributed in public discourse to a variety of reasons: climate change, population growth, rainforest destruction, intense farming, the increased trade in wildlife combined with the exponential rise in zoonotic disease. As the United Kingdom has been extricating itself from the European Union, non-EU immigration has increased, with large numbers of people travelling to and from Africa and Asia. Despite a couple of years of draconian travel restrictions and Covid lock-ups (sic), travel is still always named as the biggest driver of disease importations. The recent outbreak of monkeypox has been linked to Nigeria, with many more cases attributed to music festivals, adult saunas and orgies around the world. The 2022 British polio outbreak is thought to have been derived from another country, one which still uses a vaccine containing a live weakened strain of the polio virus; this is why the health authorities are describing the strain of poliovirus that they have detected in London as \u2018vaccine-derived\u2019. The UK itself has not used this particular vaccine, the Sabin oral vaccine, since 2004; we have reverted to the injectable Salk vaccine for our polio immunisations. Many would care to argue that polio has been given the perfect opportunity to reappear due to the Covid-19 pandemic, because of increased vaccine hesitancy and a major shift towards funding Covid-19 campaigns at the expense of other precious public health resources. Furthermore, disruptions to normal childhood immunisation schedules due to lock-ups, and a failure to provide face-to-face appointments with health professionals, will no doubt have contributed to the opportunity for polio. In the UK, vaccine administration to children has decreased in the past couple of years, especially in parts of London. Over-informed Pharmaceutical research is currently travelling at a million miles an hour, with \u2018information cascades\u2019 bubbling with details of the thousands of novel drugs currently in development. This massive volume of information is designed to confuse and overwhelm the general population. As genomic medicines travel down the brand new experimental pipeline at the speed of light, many will relax and participate in clinical trials from the comfort of their armchairs, and millions will come to expect and to rely on brand new drugs which will be delivered in record speed to their door (probably by drone). The norm will be a much shorter delay between demand and delivery. The 100 Days Mission announced by Britain, the vision of Sir Patrick Vallance and Melinda Gates, would appear to be the answer. To put that into context, until 2020 a clinical trial would take years in three back-to-back phases, up to a timescale of 3,652 days. The first Covid vaccine was delivered in 300 days. Generic medicines that the majority of us are used to will start to disappear from pharmacy shelves. Novel \u2018super-smart\u2019 genomic medicines will replace them at alarming speed\u2014but at what cost to our health? Does anyone supplying them actually care? Looking at the serious adverse reactions thus far, it seems not. The new buzzphrase that we will have to get used to will be antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Fortunately for Britain, we have our very own UK Envoy for AMR, in the form of Dame Sally Davies, Master of Trinity College, Cambridge\u2014England\u2019s previous Chief Medical Officer, who was responsible for Generation Genome. What is AMR anyway, and should we be concerned? According to the World Health Organisation, AMR occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change over time and no longer respond to medicines, making infections harder to treat and increasing the risk of severe illness and death. As a result of drug resistance, antibiotics and other antimicrobial therapies become ineffective, making infectious diseases impossible to treat. The world has neglected to research new antibiotics. Is that an oversight or a deliberate omission at a high level? With no new antibiotics riding to our rescue in this heralded pandemic era, many will find themselves reliant on new experimental heavy-duty cocktails. Those wishing to opt out of the new pharmaceutical armoury that is offered to them will undoubtedly move away from allopathic medicine entirely and opt for alternative naturopathic remedies. New variants of concern, mutants and more virulent viruses will call for super-smart medicine\u2014but not necessarily super-smart patients or super-smart medics. But ultimately, where does that leave us all? What to expect next\u2014Marburg, polio, typhoid, Ebola, Nipah, or perhaps a combination of several? Could we be about to see the elusive Disease X that experts have been warning of? Time will tell. Pandemics create panic and pandemonium; they can even open Pandora\u2019s box.",

        "title":"unmasked? BBC documentary participant speaks BBC's spectacular own goal with the is revealed from the inside by one of its highly-informed participants, Luca Barbarossa.",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.ukcolumn.org\/video\/unvaccinated-or-unmasked-bbc-documentary-participant-speaks",
        "text":"In a fascinating and significant interview, Luca Barbarossa\u2014one of seven participants in the BBC's Unvaccinated documentary screened on 20 July 2022\u2014agreed to talk to UK Column for the first time since the programme was aired and to set the record straight about what really happened on and off camera. Luca describes his stay as like living in a \"Big Brother unvaccinated house\", complete with a diary room for the participants to offload any concerns to the production team. What was it like to live with strangers, all with different reasons for not having taken a Covid vaccine and all determined to question the narrative? A career actor since 2016, Luca Barbarossa has recently appeared in a major bank's commercial for financial compatibility matchmaking. He is refreshingly open in this interview. Luca is not, and has never been, a 'crisis actor', and had only applied to take part in the documentary to address his own concerns about Covid-19 vaccine safety, the serious side effects and the impact the injection has had on his own family. Luca reveals what impact watching the heavily-edited documentary had on him, and how he feels utterly misrepresented, ridiculed and lambasted by many on social media. He discusses having felt panic-stricken on the last day of filming when, with no forewarning given to any of the participants, they were told that they were expected to attend a vaccination centre to be asked if they would now take the vaccine. Offensive, inaccurate and inappropriate games, such as jellybean roulette to illustrate victims of myocarditis\u2014a recognised serious adverse reaction from the injection, affecting thousands of young people globally, some fatally\u2014were among the simplistic presentational techniques that Professor Hannah Fry attempted, to the horror of the participants' group. Yet the consternation runs deeper than simply stunts. Scripting, misinformation, exaggerated and incorrect data are among the problems with Unvaccinated. Scientists with huge conflicts of interest from their Big Pharma commitments were the only experts presented to the group. Luca describes the documentary process as being one-sided with no fair debate. Normally chatty and confident himself, Luca was left with the impression that others in the group were being given more opportunity to comment during the documentary because they were more insistent than he was. This led to dissension within the group; strife which Professor Hannah Fry and the production team appeared to enjoy and even encourage. Crucial conversations were edited out, such as a serious one with well-known former Love Island contestant Dr Alex George, yet squabbles among the participants made the final cut. It is evident from Luca's testimony here that he is a highly-informed, passionate and confident man. He spent many hours researching the Covid vaccine issue, yet\u2014despite strongly challenging the evidence with experts presented to him by the BBC\u2014he never received any satisfactory answers. Luca admits that the whole experience has made him even more suspicious, not merely of the injection but also of scientists, academics, doctors, nurses and government. Indeed, he is far from alone: many have expressed their complete mistrust of professionals across the board, some professing that they never want to see an NHS medic or trust a Big Pharma-affiliated doctor again. What was conceived of as a candidate for a BAFTA award-winning documentary appears to have become one of the most revelatory moments in the two-year history of the Covid pandemic to date, for all the wrong reasons. Unvaccinated could perhaps more aptly have been dubbed Unveiled or Unmasked. The participants\u2014braving the BBC and navigating their way through a frankly horrific experience\u2014should be applauded for having achieved far more than their principal aim of bringing attention to serious adverse reactions and the question of whether to go for a Covid jab or not. They have done nothing short of exposing a chasm of mistrust of all experts and the media. The BBC was taken to task and failed spectacularly. The producers thought their supposedly trusted celebrity messengers would be able to persuade seven very well-read participants to go against their better judgement and offer their arms up for an experimental injection for which there is simply no long-term safety data. The BBC failed and the participants triumphed. Far from succeeding in demeaning the group, the BBC met its match and then some. Unwittingly, the BBC allowed those better informed than its own staff to ask questions that they could not answer. None of the group accepted Professor Hannah Fry's offer of a Covid jab. The participants concluded that there was no new evidence to induce confidence in the word of the BBC's experts, and Luca Barbarossa\u2014a healthy young man\u2014cannot see any point in having an injection which protects neither him nor others from the 'infection'. This is a warning that we would all do well to heed. We would like to thank Luca for his bravery and candour. His account affords invaluable insight into how the BBC works, or rather doesn't work, on the strength of its \u00a35 billion budget. Professor Hannah Fry, a prolific tweeter, has been curiously very quiet about Unvaccinated. Will this be the documentary the BBC wishes it had never aired? UK Column will be doing further work on this monumental documentary, it has opened the BBC's very own Pandora's box. Unvaccinated might be destined long to remain a thorn in the BBC's side.",

        "text":"Last Updated on August 30, 2022 Newly released data shows that big pharma-produced COVID jabs are more dangerous than the virus itself for men under 40, causing severe side effects including the lethal heart condition of myocarditis. The new data on the jab, which the definition of \u201cvaccine\u201d has been changed to accommodate, comes as even the CDC admits that the shots do nothing to stop the contraction and transmission of COVID-19. \u201cIt is now undeniable, [the] vaccine can cause more myocarditis in men under 40 than COVID-19,\u201d tweeted Dr. Vinay Prasad, a voice for truth and medical freedom who has spoken out since the early days of COVID-19 and the death jab roll-out. \u201cI have said repeatedly Moderna should be banned in men [under] 40,\u201d Prasad went on to tweet, saying that the \u201cFDA failed Americans.\u201d According to the troubling data shared by Prasad, which was extracted from a lengthy medical study, the vaccine is not only worthless at protecting against so-called \u201cbreakthrough\u201d cases but is downright dangerous and produces lethal side effects in young men. The study specifically reported the extreme dangers of the Moderna branded shot, which has been among the most controversial of the various COVID jabs. According to the data, nearly 5 times as many cases of myocarditis have been observed in men under 40 who took the 2nd dose of the Moderna jab than those who didn\u2019t take the vaccine and merely contracted the virus, which has been known to cause myocarditis on its own. Interestingly enough, the study failed to report on the medical issues suffered by those who took both vaccine doses and went on to contract the virus anyways. Severe side effects have been reported in that group since \u201cbreakthrough\u201d cases were first documented. It Is Now Undeniable \ud83d\udc47 Vaccine can cause more Myocarditis in Men Under 40 Than COVID-19; Just OUT! Patrone Circ 2022; I have said repeatedly Moderna should be banned in Men<40 FDA failed Americans & this analysis is more complicated Everyone gets breakthrough eventually 1\/7 pic.twitter.com\/CBmWcgYl1i \u2014 Vinay Prasad MD MPH (@VPrasadMDMPH) August 29, 2022 Cases of myocarditis began to massively spike upon the roll-out of COVID-19 jabs, and have continued to be observed in \u201cvaccinated\u201d young men, especially teenagers, who are otherwise in great health. In several instances, professional athletes in prime physical condition have dropped dead on the field of play due to vaccine-related health defects.

        "text":"As bad as the coronavirus and the COVID-19 sickness it causes are, warning cries are increasing over a much bigger threat with the potential to kill 90% of the U.S. population. And, unlike the virus, Washington has known of the threat for decades and done little to nothing. \u201cWe have seen this movie before and are living through it now,\u201d said Peter Pry, one of the nation\u2019s leading experts on electromagnetic pulse, the electric grid killer that threatens naturally from the sun and from weapons held by China. \u201cIf we are not even prepared for the coronavirus, imagine the consequences if we get hit with a real existential threat, like EMP,\u201d he said. Advocates for protecting the nation\u2019s electric grid and other vital systems, including military bases, from an EMP attack are seizing on the virus crisis to inject urgency into budgeting to protect electric transformers, transfer stations, and wires from disruption or meltdown. \u201cFor the $2 trillion that will be spent on the coronavirus, we could harden all critical infrastructures against EMP, deploy space-based missile defense Brilliant Pebbles before the end of a second Trump term, modernize the U.S. nuclear deterrent from top to bottom (delivery vehicles, weapons, scientific-industrial base), and have over $1 trillion to spare,\u201d said Pry, a key member of congressional EMP commissions and author of the new book The Power and the Light: The Congressional EMP Commission\u2019s War to Save America 2001 \u2013 2020. Brian Sullivan, a government and military security analyst, said, \u201cCan you imagine if our grid went down and we lost electricity for an extended period of time? As bad as our current situation is, it could always be a lot worse. We relied on our government leaders to prepare our country for a pandemic, and we see what that got us. We rely on that same leadership now to protect our electric grid.\u201d While warnings of the current pandemic have been around for less than a year, reports have been written about EMP attacks for decades. The first congressional EMP panel, for example, warned of a yearlong blackout following an attack on the electric grid. \u201cThe EMP Commission estimates a nationwide blackout of the United States lasting one year could kill 90% of Americans from starvation and societal collapse,\u201d said Pry. That would be about 295 million people. In the past, warnings have been met inside the government and energy industry with eye-rolling. But President Trump has taken the threat seriously, especially as China and other foes have developed EMP weapons, and signed an executive order to move toward protecting the grid. The military has also taken steps to protect its operations. But Pry details in his new book the efforts inside the \u201cdeep state\u201d federal bureaucracy and electric industry to \u201cslow-roll and sabotage\u201d Trump\u2019s agenda while making it look like they\u2019re making progress. \u201cThe strategy of pretending to do something but really doing nothing and then throwing money at the threat when it happens will get millions of Americans killed when there is an EMP,\u201d he told Secrets.",

        "link":"https:\/\/vaccineimpact.com\/2022\/studies-show-fertility-rates-plummet-worldwide-following-covid-19-vaccines\/",
        "text":"Comments by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News A presentation recently made by Dr. Christof Plothe, a German Doctor of Osteopathy who is also a member of the World Council for Health, reveals the most startling evidence yet that COVID vaccines are causing massive cases of infertility, not just among women, but men also. Combined with the record volume of deaths and disabilities among the COVID-19 vaccinated, the future implications of what this vaccine has done to the human population and labor pool, is almost unfathomable. This information is NOT being reported in the corporate media, and to reference it is to be labeled as someone providing \u201cdisinformation\u201d by most. The presentation was made on the Iron Will Report. I will embed the video below. Show notes: Christof Plothe has done an in-depth study on the effects of the Covid \u2018vaccines\u2019 on pregnant women. His findings are truly disturbing. In just one example, the University of Chicago asked for women who had experienced post-injection menstrual irregularities to volunteer for a study. They hoped to find 500 women. To date, they have received over 140,000 applications! Mr. Plothe\u2019s data is shocking. He shares slides of his charts on a wide range of \u2018vaccine\u2019 affects, including drops in fertility around the world, accumulation of lipid nanoparticles and spike proteins in the various organs of the body, and the fact that the risk of miscarriage with the Covid \u2018vaccines\u2019 is over 1500 times higher than with the flu vaccine. How many safety studies were done on pregnant women? (Spoiler: the answer is \u2018none\u2019) How many of the \u2018scientists\u2019 involved in Pfizer\u2019s safety trial own shares in Pfizer? (Spoiler: the answer is \u2018all of them\u2019) To what degree have birth rates dropped around the world since the start of the \u2018vaccine\u2019 rollouts? Could the children of injected mothers be born sterile? Why were no human studies done on the effects of the lipid nanoparticles, which are known to be toxic? The lipid nanoparticles collect in the highest concentration in the reproductive organs. Is this intentional to produce infertility? What other side effects do the lipid nanoparticles produce? For how long do the spike proteins remain active (and damaging) in the human body? Highlights by Dr. Mark Trozzi: Pregnancy last 9 months, yet these \u201cvaccines\u201d were approved in in just 108 days. How can any claim of safety in pregnancy be made? Normally vaccine approval takes ten years. Pregnant women were excluded from clinical trials, yet the injections were declared safe for pregnant women. Based therefore on nothing! 270 women did get pregnant during the Pfizer trial ; of those 238 were not reported, and only one normal birth was reported. Polyethyleneglycol which is a component of the pegylated nanoparticle used to deliver the genetic material into the human cells was known to be a fetal toxin before since before covid was launched. Moderna and Pfizer-biotech studies on 44 rats for just 42 days demonstrated a doubling of preimplantation loss of pregnancy, and 295% increased rate of birth defects. There was no evaluation of next generation effects, and the researchers were riddled with conflicts of interest that they tried to hide. Fertility requires long term studies. These have not been done. By sept 2021 tens of thousands of menstrual problems in women were reported following the jabs, with heavy bleeding 8000 times normal! Japan study of biodistribution showed extensive distribution with profound concentration in women\u2019s ovaries. Potential mechanisms of fertility harm include pegylated nanoparticle toxicity, spike protein toxicity , immune response to SP , autoimmune attack on SP producing ovaries, and immune attack on an essential reproductive protein syncytin-1 which is structurally similar to SP. Moderna \u201cvaccine\u201d uses a higher dose of 100 mcg than Pfizer\u2019s 30 mcg dose. Pfizer stopped the higher dose due to even higher toxicity, but moderna still uses it. The injected mRNA persists in most victims for 2 months, and stimulates spike protein production with SP persisting 15 months. SP damages male testes with dramatic reduction in spermatogenisis An Israel study showed sperm count and male fertility decreased with just one shot, then the study was ended. So what happens with repeat doses? USA VAERS reveals massive infertility issue reports, accounting for 95% of all infertility reports in the 30 years of reporting for all vaccines combined. Around the world, wherever the \u201cvaccines\u201d are rolled out, birth rates drop dramatically nine months later. This is unprecedented, and includes Ireland, Germany, Australia, UK, Switzerland, Sweden, Canada, Hungary and others. The most injected countries have the biggest drops in birth rates. In comparison with influenza vaccines, these injections have a 1500% higher associated miscarriage rate. Some studies show polyethylene glycol causing next generation infertility. Perhaps injected people will have sterile children. We need long term controls, but drug companies injected the control subjects after the brief study periods, thus eliminating long term controls. The closest thing we have is the countries where people have best resisted the forced injections. Stop the Vaccines. Stop suppressing ivermectin and promote safe covid treatment. Stop the persecution of the doctors who have been scientifically and ethically correct from the beginning. These doctors must be exonerated and returned to serving the people who need us now more than ever. Dr Plothe explores the possibility of this genetic modification of humans to produce toxic viral spike proteins, being inherited and the implications that may have for the children. Presentation ends at 24 min and Will\u2019s questions start: Iron Will raises issues of malpractice, intention, misrepresentation, fraud, compromised journals, persecuted good doctors, and the CDC hiding deaths having removed 50,000 deaths from the VAERS data base and reclassifying them. Unknowns include: will this genetic experiment result in inheritable poison SP production in humans? Will there be future generations? Dr Plothe is seeing many covid \u201cvaccine\u201d damaged patients daily in his practice and he relates some of these experiences. Dr Plothe reminds us how science really works, and calls to end the suppression and have open forums. \u201cLets go back to science; today, not tomorrow.\u201d Comment by Dr Trozzi: Thanks to Iron Will and Dr Plothe. The reality is tragic; but this interview and content is exceptional. There should be no question about stopping these injections immediately, as well as investigating and prosecuting the many high profiting perpetrators and accomplices to unprecedented crimes against humanity. Imagine, even at this time, the Universities of Western Ontario and Toronto are demanding that students be injected and subjected to this sterilization, or forfeit their education. Government officials who are mandating this are at war with innocent unsuspecting men, women, and children. Comment on this article at HealthImpactNews.com. See Also: Over 11 MILLION Views!

        "text":"by Matt Agorist The Free Thought Project As TFTP has reported, Sen. Richard Pan, D-Sacramento, who has sponsored a slew of mandatory vaccine laws throughout his career came out in 2019 to threaten the speech of those who question forced vaccination. Throughout the pandemic, Pan has been staunchly opposed to free speech and advocated for silencing anyone and everyone who doesn\u2019t worship at the alter of Big Pharma and TheScience(TM). Now, with the passage of Assembly Bill 2098, this tyrannical state senator has finally gotten his way and even doctors who question the safety of a product from a company with a known history of criminal behavior \u2014 will be punished by the state for doing so. TFTP predicted this was coming after a letter Pan wrote to the Attorney General of the United States, claiming that the \u201cdeliberate spread of vaccine information discouraging vaccination\u201d requires the surgeon general to \u201cstop this attack on our nation\u2019s health by addressing the spread of vaccine misinformation.\u201d He literally advocated for people to be jailed for questioning vaccines \u2014 and now he\u2019s gone even further. The prediction wasn\u2019t hard to make given that this totalitarian likened \u201cantivaxxers\u201d to terrorists and was given a platform in WaPo to do it. \u201cThis campaign to deny potentially life-saving vaccines to those seeking them, and to poison public opinion against vaccinations, could result in countless American deaths. That is akin to domestic terrorism,\u201d Pan wrote. Pan has also criticized Facebook and other social media groups for allowing vaccine skeptics to post their views when he was given a platform in the NY Times. \u201cThis movement not only puts out mis- or disinformation about vaccines or lies about vaccines, which in itself can be harmful, but they are also aggressively bullying, threatening and intimidating people who are trying to share accurate information about vaccines,\u201d Pan told the New York Times. But is questioning the safety of the COVID-19 jab really misinformation? According to the bill\u2019s text: THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS: SECTION 1.The Legislature finds and declares all of the following: (a) The global spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, or COVID-19, has claimed the lives of over 6,000,000 people worldwide, including nearly 90,000 Californians. (b) Data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that unvaccinated individuals are at a risk of dying from COVID-19 that is 11 times greater than those who are fully vaccinated. (c) The safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines have been confirmed through evaluation by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the vaccines continue to undergo intensive safety monitoring by the CDC. Aaron Kheriaty, a licensed medical doctor in the state of California points out, all three of these statements are demonstrably false:(a) The death count figures cited are grossly overestimated by hospitals failing to distinguish dying from covid vs. dying with covid and the financial incentives from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to overestimate covid deaths; (b) the efficacy of vaccines has declined with time and new variants, so the statistic cited here is no longer true of the vaccines against omicron; (c) the CDC has consistently failed to follow-up on serious safety signals, apart from myocarditis, and the post-marketing surveillance data acquired from our FOIA request showed serious safety issues in the first three months of vaccine rollout. Now, however, any physician who raises these or other inconvenient scientific facts or study findings could be disciplined by the medical board, as the text of the bill explains: \u201cIt shall constitute unprofessional conduct for a physician and surgeon to disseminate misinformation or disinformation related to COVID-19, including false or misleading information regarding the nature and risks of the virus, its prevention and treatment; and the development, safety, and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.\u201d If this is the case and they will apply this equally, will they go back and punish all the doctors who told the country for months that the vaccines are 100 percent effective? Will those who claimed that should you receive a COVID-19 vaccine you will not catch the virus and will not get sick, which is now a demonstrably false statement, be punished? According to former CDC director Dr. Deborah Birx, this was a statement which they knew was false from the beginning. In early 2021, CDC director Rochelle Walensky had no problem going on national television and declaring to the world that if you took the covid-19 vaccine \u201cyou will not get or spread covid.\u201d Within weeks, this was found to be entirely untrue. The CDC also changed positions on masks several times, claimed you can catch covid from touching surfaces, and continues to recommend cloth masks, despite the massive pile of data showing they do absolutely nothing. Dr. Anthony Fauci also spread the exact same misinformation, telling Americans that they had nothing to worry about once they took the shots. Yet hundreds of thousands of people who took the shots, got sick and died. Does this apply to all the state-funded doctors who told the country that if you get poked you can't spread or contract COVID-19? OR does it only apply to doctors who share peer-reviewed data showing the adverse effects of the poke? Asking for the Ministry of Truth. pic.twitter.com\/Xxpqc9CEz2 \u2014 Matt Agorist (@MattAgorist) August 30, 2022 Instead of holding these state actors and mass purveyors of misinformation accountable, this bill and others like it will target the folks responsible for proving these state actors wrong and getting us out of this mess. This is as shameful as it is dangerous. This bill will inevitably stifle medical progress by silencing anyone who challenges The Science(TM). But as we\u2019ve seen over the last two-and-a-half years, those who challenged the consensus on COVID-19 have helped usher in new treatments, policies, and programs that have saved lives. It was the establishment \u201cconsensus\u201d who refused to change and adapt, especially when it came to children \u2014 causing immeasurable suffering \u2014 the likes of which we are only just realizing. As Dr. Kheriaty noted in a letter to the California Assembly, urging them not to pass this bill in June, \u201cAllowing the free interchange among competing perspectives is absolutely necessary for scientific and medical progress. Good science is characterized by conjecture and refutation, lively deliberation, often fierce debate, and always openness to new data. The censorship of free speech in AB 2098 spells not only the demise of civil liberties and constitutional rights, but the end of the scientific enterprise when it comes to dealing with Covid in CA.\u201d Unfortunately, the thought police in California did not listen. RIP scientific method and freedom of speech. If history has taught us anything it\u2019s that the government declaring what is truth and what is not, is far more detrimental to a free society than any misleading or inaccurate information ever could be.

Pan has also criticized Facebook and other social media groups for allowing vaccine skeptics to post their views when he was given a platform in the NY Times. \u201cThis movement not only puts out mis- or disinformation about vaccines or lies about vaccines, which in itself can be harmful, but they are also aggressively bullying, threatening and intimidating people who are trying to share accurate information about vaccines,\u201d Pan told the New York Times. But is questioning the safety of the COVID-19 jab really misinformation? According to the bill\u2019s text: THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS: SECTION 1.The Legislature finds and declares all of the following: (a) The global spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, or COVID-19, has claimed the lives of over 6,000,000 people worldwide, including nearly 90,000 Californians. (b) Data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that unvaccinated individuals are at a risk of dying from COVID-19 that is 11 times greater than those who are fully vaccinated. (c) The safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines have been confirmed through evaluation by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the vaccines continue to undergo intensive safety monitoring by the CDC. Aaron Kheriaty, a licensed medical doctor in the state of California points out, all three of these statements are demonstrably false:(a) The death count figures cited are grossly overestimated by hospitals failing to distinguish dying from covid vs. dying with covid and the financial incentives from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to overestimate covid deaths; (b) the efficacy of vaccines has declined with time and new variants, so the statistic cited here is no longer true of the vaccines against omicron; (c) the CDC has consistently failed to follow-up on serious safety signals, apart from myocarditis, and the post-marketing surveillance data acquired from our FOIA request showed serious safety issues in the first three months of vaccine rollout. Now, however, any physician who raises these or other inconvenient scientific facts or study findings could be disciplined by the medical board, as the text of the bill explains: \u201cIt shall constitute unprofessional conduct for a physician and surgeon to disseminate misinformation or disinformation related to COVID-19, including false or misleading information regarding the nature and risks of the virus, its prevention and treatment; and the development, safety, and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.\u201d If this is the case and they will apply this equally, will they go back and punish all the doctors who told the country for months that the vaccines are 100 percent effective? Will those who claimed that should you receive a COVID-19 vaccine you will not catch the virus and will not get sick, which is now a demonstrably false statement, be punished? According to former CDC director Dr. Deborah Birx, this was a statement which they knew was false from the beginning. In early 2021, CDC director Rochelle Walensky had no problem going on national television and declaring to the world that if you took the covid-19 vaccine \u201cyou will not get or spread covid.\u201d Within weeks, this was found to be entirely untrue. The CDC also changed positions on masks several times, claimed you can catch covid from touching surfaces, and continues to recommend cloth masks, despite the massive pile of data showing they do absolutely nothing. Dr. Anthony Fauci also spread the exact same misinformation, telling Americans that they had nothing to worry about once they took the shots. Yet hundreds of thousands of people who took the shots, got sick and died. Does this apply to all the state-funded doctors who told the country that if you get poked you can't spread or contract COVID-19? OR does it only apply to doctors who share peer-reviewed data showing the adverse effects of the poke? Asking for the Ministry of Truth. pic.twitter.com\/Xxpqc9CEz2 \u2014 Matt Agorist (@MattAgorist) August 30, 2022 Instead of holding these state actors and mass purveyors of misinformation accountable, this bill and others like it will target the folks responsible for proving these state actors wrong and getting us out of this mess. This is as shameful as it is dangerous. This bill will inevitably stifle medical progress by silencing anyone who challenges The Science(TM). But as we\u2019ve seen over the last two-and-a-half years, those who challenged the consensus on COVID-19 have helped usher in new treatments, policies, and programs that have saved lives. It was the establishment \u201cconsensus\u201d who refused to change and adapt, especially when it came to children \u2014 causing immeasurable suffering \u2014 the likes of which we are only just realizing. As Dr. Kheriaty noted in a letter to the California Assembly, urging them not to pass this bill in June, \u201cAllowing the free interchange among competing perspectives is absolutely necessary for scientific and medical progress. Good science is characterized by conjecture and refutation, lively deliberation, often fierce debate, and always openness to new data. The censorship of free speech in AB 2098 spells not only the demise of civil liberties and constitutional rights, but the end of the scientific enterprise when it comes to dealing with Covid in CA.\u201d Unfortunately, the thought police in California did not listen. RIP scientific method and freedom of speech. If history has taught us anything it\u2019s that the government declaring what is truth and what is not, is far more detrimental to a free society than any misleading or inaccurate information ever could be.

        "link":"https:\/\/vaccineimpact.com\/2022\/rna-for-modernas-omicron-booster-manufactured-by-cia-linked-company\/",
        "text":"Since late last year, messenger RNA for Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccines, including its recently reformulated Omicron booster, has been exclusively manufactured by a little known company with significant ties to US intelligence. by WHITNEY WEBB Unlimited Hangout Earlier this week, the United Kingdom became the first country to approve Moderna\u2019s reformulated version of its COVID-19 vaccine, which claims to provide protection against both the original form of the virus and the significantly less lethal but more transmissible Omicron variant. The product was approved by the UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) with the support of the UK government\u2019s Commission on Human Medicines. Described by UK officials as a \u201csharpened tool\u201d in the nation\u2019s continued vaccination campaign, the reformulated vaccine combines the previously approved COVID-19 vaccine with a \u201cvaccine candidate\u201d targeting the Omicron variant BA.1. That vaccine candidate has never been previously approved and has not been the subject of independent study. The MHRA approved the vaccine based on a single, incomplete human trial currently being conducted by Moderna. The company promoted incomplete data from that trial in company press releases in June and July. The study has yet to be published in a medical journal or peer reviewed. No concerns have been raised by any regulatory agency, including the MHRA, regarding Moderna\u2019s past history of engaging in suspect and likely illegal activity in past product trials, including for its original COVID-19 vaccine. The approval comes shortly before several Western countries, including the UK, plan to conduct a massive COVID-19 booster vaccination campaign this fall. Moderna has also noted that approval for its Omicron booster vaccine are pending in the US, EU, Australia and Canada \u2013 all of which are also planning fall vaccination campaigns focused on COVID-19. The company\u2019s CEO, St\u00e9phane Bancel, has called the reformulated vaccine \u201cour lead candidate for a Fall 2022 booster.\u201d Moderna CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel, Source: ClockworkOrange However, unlike the company\u2019s original COVID-19 vaccine, the genetic material, or messenger RNA (mRNA), for this new vaccine, including the newly formulated genetic material meant to provide protection against the Omicron variant, is being manufactured, not by Moderna, but by a relatively new company that has received hardly any media attention, despite its overt links to US intelligence. Last September, it was quietly announced that a company called National Resilience (often referred to simply as Resilience) would begin manufacturing the mRNA for Moderna COVID-19 vaccine products. Under the terms of the multi-year agreement, \u201cResilience will produce mRNA for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at its facility in Mississauga, Ontario, for distribution worldwide.\u201d \u201cReinventing Biomanufacturing\u201d National Resilience was founded relatively recently, in November 2020, and describes itself as \u201ca manufacturing and technology company dedicated to broadening access to complex medicines and protecting biopharmaceutical supply chains against disruption.\u201d It has since been building \u201ca sustainable network of high-tech, end-to-end manufacturing solutions with the aim to ensure the medicines of today and tomorrow can be made quickly, safely, and at scale.\u201d It furtherplans to \u201creinvent biomanufacturing\u201d and \u201cdemocratize access to medicines,\u201d namely gene therapies, experimental vaccines and other \u201cmedicines of tomorrow.\u201d In pursuit of those goals, the company announced it would \u201cactively invest in developing powerful new technologies to manufacture complex medicines that are defining the future of therapeutics, including cell and gene therapies, viral vectors, vaccines, and proteins.\u201d It was founded with the reported intention \u201cto build a better system for manufacturing complex medicines to fight deadly diseases\u201d as a way to improve post-COVID \u201cpandemic preparedness.\u201d The company initially marketed its manufacturing capabilities as \u201cthe Resilience platform\u201d, and offers principally \u201cRNA Modalities\u201d, including RNA development for vaccines, gene editing and therapeutics; and \u201cVirus Production\u201d, including viral vectors, oncolytic viruses (i.e. a virus engineered to preferentially attack cancer cells), viruses for use in vaccine development and gene-edited viruses for unspecified purposes. It is worth noting that, to date, many controversial \u201cgain-of-function\u201d experiments have justified modifying viruses for the same purposes as described by National Resilience\u2019s Virus Production capabilities. In addition, National Resilience offers product formulations and other modalities, such as biologics and cell therapies, to its clientele and the \u201cVirus Production\u201d of its website has since been removed. Resilience CEO Rahul Singhvi, Source: Resilience National Resilience, being such a young company, has very few clients and there is little publicly available information on its manufacturing capabilities aside from the company\u2019s website. The firm only acquired its first commercial manufacturing plant in March 2021, located in Boston, MA and purchased from Sanofi, followed shortly thereafter by the acquisition of another separate plant located in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Makeovers were announced for the plants, but little is publicly known about their progress. Prior to the acquisitions, the company had been subleasing a Bay area facility in Fremont, California. Reporters were puzzled at the time as to why a company with roughly 700 employees at the time had acquired a total of 599,00 square feet of manufacturing space after having only emerged from stealth less than 6 months prior. In April 2021, National Resilience acquired Ology Bioservices Inc., which had received a $37 million contract from the US military the previous November to develop an advanced anti-COVID-19 monoclonal antibody treatment. This acquisition also provided National Resilience with its first Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory and the ability to manufacture cell and gene therapies, live viral vaccines and vectors and oncolytic viruses. Despite being in the earliest stages of developing its \u201crevolutionary\u201d manufacturing capabilities, National Resilience entered into a partnership with the Government of Canada in July of last year. Per that agreement, the Canadian government plans to invest CAD 199.2 million (about $154.9 million) into National Resilience\u2019s Ontario-based subsidiary, Resilience Biotechnologies Inc. Most of those funds are destined for use in expanding the Ontario facility that Resilience acquired last March and which is now manufacturing the mRNA for Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 products. Canada\u2019s Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne, asserted at the time that the investment would \u201cbuild future pandemic preparedness\u201d and help \u201cto grow Canada\u2019s life science ecosystem as an engine for our economic recovery.\u201d More recently, in 2022, the company has announced a few new clients \u2013 Takeda, Opus Genetics and the US Department of Defense. According to National Resilience\u2019s executives, the company\u2019s ambitions apparently go far beyond manufacturing RNA and viruses. For instance, Resilience CEO Rahul Singhvi has claimed that the company is seeking to build \u201cthe world\u2019s most advanced biopharmaceutical manufacturing ecosystem.\u201d Yet, Singhvi has declined to offer much in the way of specifics when it comes to exactly how the company plans to become the planet\u2019s most elite biomanufacturing company. In an interview with The San Francisco Business Times, Singhvi states that Resilience is looking to fill its massive manufacturing plants with \u201ctechnologies and people that can set and apply new standards for manufacturing cell therapies and gene therapies as well as RNA-based treatments.\u201d Prior to Resilience, Singhvi was CEO of NovaVax and an operating partner at Flagship Pioneering, which played a major role in the creation and rise of Moderna. Singhvi has further insisted that National Resilience is \u201cnot a therapeutics company, not a contractor and not a tools company\u201d and instead aims \u201cto boost production using the new therapeutic modalities\u201d such as RNA-based treatments, which have become normalized in the COVID-19 era. Whereas contract manufacturers \u201care like kitchens, with pots and pans ready for any recipe,\u201d \u201cwhat we\u2019re trying to do is fix the recipes,\u201d Singhvi has explained. One member of Resilience\u2019s board of directors, former FDA Commissioner and Pfizer Board member Scott Gottlieb, has described the company as seeking to act as the equivalent of Amazon Web Services for the biotechnology industry. Essentially, Resilience bills itself as offering solutions that will allow \u201cfuturistic\u201d medicines, including mRNA vaccines, to be produced more quickly and more efficiently, with the apparent goal of monopolizing certain parts of the biomanufacturing process. It also appears poised to become the manufacturer of choice for mRNA vaccines and experimental therapeutics in the event of a future pandemic, which some public health \u201cphilanthropists\u201d like Bill Gates have said is imminent. Perhaps the company\u2019s most noteworthy ambition relates to their claims that they support clients through the government regulatory process. Given the company\u2019s emphasis on speedy mass production of experimental gene therapies, its stated intention of getting the \u201cfuturistic\u201d medical products it manufactures to market as quickly as possible seems at odds with the slower, traditional regulatory processes. Indeed, one could easily argue that the approvals of mRNA vaccines for the first time in human history during the COVID-19 crisis were only possible because of the major relaxing of regulatory procedurse and safety testing due to the perceived urgency of the situation. Resilience seems intent on seeing that phenomenon repeat itself. As previously mentioned, the company claims to allow for the setting and application of \u201cnew standards for manufacturing cell therapies and gene therapies\u201d and also says it plans to become a \u201ctechnology-aggregating standards bearer that helps therapies come to market more efficiently.\u201d It previously offered on its website \u201cregulatory support\u201d and \u201cstrategy consulting\u201d to clients, suggesting that it would seek to mediate between clients and government regulators in order to fulfill its goal of having the products it manufactures taken to market more quickly. In addition, upon launch, the company claimed it planned to obtain unspecified \u201cregulatory capabilities.\u201d If so, it is certainly notable that former top Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials are either on the company\u2019s board or, as will be noted shortly, played a major role in the company\u2019s creation. The People Behind Resilience Resilience was co-founded by Biotech venture capitalist Robert Nelsen, who is known for listening \u201cto science\u2019s earliest whispers, even when data are too early for just about anyone else.\u201d Nelsen was one of the earliest investors in Illumina, a California-based gene-sequencing hardware and software giant that is believed to currently dominate the field of genomics. As mentioned in a previous Unlimited Hangout investigation, Illumina is closely tied to the DARPA-equivalent of the Wellcome Trust known as Wellcome Leap, which is also focused on \u201cfuturistic\u201d and transhumanist \u201cmedicines.\u201d Nelsen is now chairman of National Resilience\u2019s board, which is a \u201cWho\u2019s Who\u201d of big players from the US National Security State, Big Pharma and Pharma-related \u201cphilanthropy.\u201d Bob Nelsen of ARCH Venture Partners, Source: ARCH Venture Partners However, while Nelsen has been given much of the credit for creating Resilience, he revealed in one interview that the idea for the company had actually come from someone else \u2013 Luciana Borio. In July of last year, Nelsen revealed that it was while talking to Borio about \u201cher work running pandemic preparedness on the NSC [National Security Council]\u201d that had \u201chelped lead to the launch of Nelsen\u2019s $800 million biologics manufacturing startup Resilience.\u201d At the time of their conversation, Borio was the vice president of In-Q-tel, the venture capital arm of the CIA that has been used since its creation in the early 2000s to found a number of companies, many of which act as Agency fronts. Prior to In-Q-Tel, she served as director for medical and biodefense preparedness at the National Security Council during the Trump administration and had previously been the acting chief scientist at the FDA from 2015 to 2017. Borio is currently a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, a consultant to Goldman Sachs, a member of the Bill Gates-funded vaccine alliance CEPI, and a partner at Nelsen\u2019s venture capital firm ARCH Venture Partners, which funds Resilience. Nelsen\u2019s ARCH previously funded Nanosys, the company of the controversial scientist Charles Lieber. Around the time of her conversation with Nelsen that led to Resilience\u2019s creation, Borio was co-writing a policy paper for the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security that recommended linking COVID-19 vaccination status with food stamp programs and rent assistance as a possible means of coercing certain populations to take the experimental vaccine. Borio is hardly Resilience\u2019s only In-Q-Tel connection, as the CEO of In-Q-Tel, Chris Darby, sits on the company\u2019s board of directors. Darby is also on the board of directors of the CIA Officers Memorial Foundation. Darby was also recently a member of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI), where members of the military, intelligence community and Silicon Valley\u2019s top firms argued for the need to reduce the use of \u201clegacy systems\u201d in favor of AI-focused alternatives as a national security imperative. Among those \u201clegacy systems\u201d identified by the NSCAI were in-person doctor visits and even receiving medical care from a human doctor, as opposed to an AI \u201cdoctor.\u201d The NSCAI also argued for the removal of \u201cregulatory barriers\u201d that prevent these new technologies from replacing \u201clegacy systems.\u201d Resilience Board Member Drew Oetting, Source: 8VC Another notable board member, in discussing Resilience\u2019s intelligence ties, is Drew Oetting. Oetting works for Cerberus Capital Management, the firm headed by Steve Feinberg who previously led the President\u2019s Intelligence Advisory Board under the Trump administration. Cerberus is notably the parent company of DynCorp, a controversial US national security contractor tied to numerous scandals, including scandals related to sex trafficking in conflict zones. Oetting is also part of the CIA-linked Thorn NGO ostensibly focused on tackling child trafficking that was the subject of a previous Unlimited Hangout investigation. Oetting is also the co-founder of 8VC, a venture capital firm that is one of the main investors in Resilience. 8VC\u2019s other co-founder is Joe Lonsdale and Oetting \u201cstarted his career\u201d as Lonsdale\u2019s chief of staff. Lonsdale is the co-founder, alongside Peter Thiel and Alex Karp, of Palantir, a CIA front company and intelligence contractor that is the successor to DARPA\u2019s controversial Total Information Awareness (TIA) mass surveillance and data-mining program. In addition, Oetting previously worked for Bill Gates\u2019 investment fund. Also worth noting is the presence of Joseph Robert Kerrey, former US Senator for Nebraska and a former member of the conflict-of-interest-ridden 9\/11 Commission, on Resilience\u2019s board. Kerrey is currently managing director of Allen & Co., a New York investment banking firm which has hosted an annual \u201csummer camp for billionaires\u201d since 1983. Allen & Co. has long been a major player in networks where organized crime and intelligence intersect, and is mentioned repeatedly throughout my upcoming book One Nation Under Blackmail. For instance, Charles and Herbert Allen, who ran the firm for decades, had considerable business dealings with organized crime kingpins and frontmen for notorious gangsters like Meyer Lansky, particularly in the Bahamas. They were also business partners of Leslie Wexner\u2019s mentors A. Alfred Taubman and Max Fisher as well as associates of Earl Brian, one of the architects of the PROMIS software scandal \u2013 which saw organized crime and intelligence networks cooperate to steal and then compromise the PROMIS software for blackmail and clandestine intelligence-gathering purposes. Allen & Co. was a major investor in Brian\u2019s business interests in the technology industry that Brian used in attempts to bankrupt the developers of PROMIS, Inslaw Inc. and to market versions of PROMIS that had been compromised first by Israeli intelligence and, later, the CIA. In addition to these intelligence-linked individuals, the rest of Resilience\u2019s board includes the former CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Susan Desmond-Hellmann; former FDA Commissioner and Pfizer board member, Scott Gottlieb; two former executives at Johnson & Johnson; former president and CEO of Teva Pharmaceuticals North American branch, George Barrett; CalTech professor and board member of Alphabet (i.e. Google) and Illumina, Frances Arnold; former executive at Genentech and Merck, Patrick Yang; and Resilience CEO Rahul Singhvi. To Boost or Not to Boost It is certainly telling that the normally publicity hungry Moderna has said so little about its partnership with Resilience and that Resilience, despite its ambitious plans, has also avoided the media limelight. Considering Moderna\u2019s history and Resilience\u2019s connections, there may be more to this partnership that meets the eye and concerned members of the public would do well to keep a very close eye on Resilience, its partnerships, and the products it is manufacturing. Given that we now live in a world where government regulatory decisions on the approval of medicines are increasingly influenced by corporate press releases and normal regulatory procedures have fallen by the wayside for being too \u201cslow,\u201d there is likely to be little scrutiny of the genetic material that Resilience produces for the \u201cmedicines of tomorrow.\u201d This seems to be already true for Moderna\u2019s recently retooled COVID-19 vaccine, as there has been no independent examination of the new genetic sequence of mRNA used in the Omicron-specific vaccine candidate or its effects on the human body in the short, medium or long term. For those who are skeptical of the outsized role that intelligence-linked companies are playing in the attempted technological \u201crevolution\u201d in the medical field, it is best to consider Resilience\u2019s role in the upcoming fall vaccination campaign and in future pandemic and public health scenarios before trying its \u201cfuturistic\u201d products.

        "title":"Coronavirus UPDATE: Massive coverup exposed by bioweapons expert",
        "link":"https:\/\/www.naturalhealth365.com\/coronavirus-death-toll-3285.html",
        "text":"(NaturalHealth365) As we continue to report on the latest news about the coronavirus epidemic, we\u2019re beginning to realize there\u2019s so much more to 2019-nCoV than mainstream media would have you believe. We only need to start with the virus\u2019s origin story to start pulling back the layers of deception and misinformation. As we\u2019ve stated in an earlier article, the prevalent theory has been that the coronavirus began in a wet market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Now, blistering new revelations from an American bioweapons expert shatter this theory and point to a much more sinister beginning for the virus, which has amassed a current death toll of over 800 people. Deadly virus created in a Wuhan laboratory, says U.S. international law professor \u2013 a laboratory specially designated by the World Health Organization Dr. Francis Boyle is a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law. He holds multiple prestigious degrees, including a doctor of law degree from Harvard Law School and a PhD in Political Science from Harvard University. He\u2019s best known for drafting The Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989. In a recent interview published on January 30 to YouTube, Dr. Boyle gave a detailed account of how 2019-nCoV didn\u2019t originate in the wet market of the Hubei province. Was the virus ever actually present in the market, and could its presence have accelerated the rapid viral outbreak? Absolutely, Dr. Boyle and others argue. But that doesn\u2019t mean the virus actually began there. So, where did this dangerous strain of coronavirus begin? Dr Boyle contends that the virus was manufactured and bio-engineered in a Biosafety Level 4 laboratory \u2013 a laboratory that just so happens to be located directly in Wuhan. This laboratory is specially designated by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the only lab in China that can contain and work with the world\u2019s deadliest viruses. Dr. Boyle asserts this is proof that the WHO knows far more about the outbreak than they are letting on. The allegation is consistent with a January 2020 paper published by The Lancet, which found that more than a third of the patients tested in their sample had NO contact with the Wuhan wet market, including \u201cPatient Zero.\u201d In other words, growing evidence suggests that 2019-nCoV leaked out of the Wuhan laboratory and into the surrounding community, where it would go on to infect thousands of unsuspecting people \u2013 a number that\u2019s steadily rising. Now scrambling to contain the epidemic, the Chinese government initially tried to cover it up. They even threatened and attempted to silence a Chinese doctor named Li Wenliang who first warned of the coming outbreak. Sadly, breaking reports tell us that Wenliang succumbed to the virus on February 7. New coronavirus has links to manufactured SARS virus, HIV virus Why manufacture and design a lethal and unprecedented virus? Simple, Dr. Boyle asserts: to create biological weapons for warfare. In the interview (which hopefully won\u2019t be removed from YouTube), he hypothesizes that WHO-affiliated Wuhan scientists genetically tinkered with the coronavirus responsible for SARS (SARS-CoV) until it became the monstrosity it is now (2019-nCoV). The current coronavirus reportedly has a 15 percent greater fatality rate and 83 percent greater infection rate than SARS did, which ransacked the world in 2002 to 2004. Dr. Boyle also cites evidence indicating that Chinese officials smuggled coronavirus materials out of a Canadian lab that\u2019s known for leading research, development, and testing of biological warfare weapons. Additionally, a team of Indian virologists just revealed in a January 2020 paper that the 2019-nCoV shares an \u201cuncanny similarity\u201d of genetic inserts with the virus that causes AIDS. (Their paper has been withdrawn\u2026another thinly-veiled cover up attempt?) Tellingly, Chinese doctors have reportedly been using the HIV drug lopinavir\/ritonavir as an off-label treatment for people with 2019-nCoV\u2026so clearly there\u2019s no denying at least some link between these two viruses. Meanwhile, other scientists seem to be wasting no time to continue tinkering with viruses and trying to capitalize on the outbreak. In an article published by CNN on February 7, Robin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London, states rather bluntly: \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that as a global community we maximize our effort to get a vaccine available in the shortest possible time.\u201d Big Pharma experts are hopeful that a vaccine will be available as soon as 2021 \u2013 \u201cfaster than it\u2019s been done before,\u201d brags Shattock.

        "link":"https:\/\/www.naturalhealth365.com\/irrefutable-evidence-mrna-covid-jab-causes-vascular-and-organ-damage.html",
        "text":"(NaturalHealth365) We already have hard proof that the mRNA COVID shots can damage vascular health \u2013 indeed, cardiovascular problems like heart inflammation (myocarditis, pericarditis) are listed as adverse effects in unsealed Pfizer documents and in Pfizer\u2019s mRNA jab package insert. Now, a duo of doctors has combed through a large collection of data to reveal just how damaging these shots have been and continue to be for the human body. Worrisomely, it doesn\u2019t just appear to be a unique COVID shot problem \u2013 the authors fear that all future drugs involving mRNA technology may lead to the same dismal outcomes. Evidence is \u201cirrefutable\u201d \u2013 mRNA tech used in gene-based COVID shots is harming injected individuals, causing potentially-deadly vascular problems In an August 19, 2022 article published by Doctors for COVID Ethics, Michael Palmer, MD, and Sucharit Bhakdi, MD, discuss what they call \u201cirrefutable proof of causality\u201d between COVID shots, vascular harm, and organ damage. Citing autopsy results from deceased vaxxed individuals as well as data from published experimental studies, the doctors make several important claims. First, these mRNA vaccines do NOT stay at the injection site as many mainstream vax proponents continue to insist. Instead, it is evident that materials from these drugs spread throughout the body via \u201crapid distribution\u201d through the bloodstream and can accumulate in various organs. Even Pfizer\u2019s own animal research proves this, Dr. Palmer and Dr. Bhakdi point out, referencing Pfizer\u2019s application for vax approval in Japan. Dr. Palmer and Dr. Bhakdi flush out several other concerning facts about these shots as indicated by various research, including the following: The expression of spike proteins that occurs as a result of the vax is \u201cwidespread\u201d throughout the body; cells found to \u201cstrongly express\u201d spike protein production have been found everywhere from the lymph nodes to the lungs \u2026 and often for several months post-jab Spike proteins made by the body in response to the vax \u201cinduces autoimmune-like inflammation\u201d The inflammation induced by these shots has been shown to cause serious, and sometimes deadly organ damage, including within blood vessels, which can \u201cpromote blood clotting, and clotting-related diseases such as heart attack, stroke, lung embolism,\u201d all of which are \u201cvery common in the adverse events databases\u201d The co-authors also cite a recent Swedish study published in Current Issues in Molecular Biology, which found that human liver cells grown in a lab and exposed to the Pfizer mRNA shot can actually reverse-transcribe the mRNA and insert it into their own chromosomal DNA. This is an astounding knock against the claim from the mainstream narrative that mRNA from the COVID shots cannot affect a person\u2019s DNA and absolutely warrants further investigation. A hint at what\u2019s to come? As government and public health officials continue to psychologically groom us for even more compliance and medical subjugation by repeatedly referring to \u201cthe next pandemic,\u201d the research analysis by Dr. Palmer and Dr. Bhakdi comes with an important warning. The doctors explain that the mechanisms by which the current mRNA COVID jabs cause harm to the human body are indeed \u201cnot limited to COVID-19 vaccines only but is completely general \u2013 it must be expected to occur similarly with mRNA vaccines against any and all infectious pathogens.\u201d \u201cThis technology has failed and must be abandoned,\u201d they say. The problem, of course, is that three-letter agencies and pharmaceutical companies are currently running away with this technology in the hunt to find new applications for mRNA. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that \u201cmRNA vaccines have been studied before for flu, Zika, rabies, and cytomegalovirus (CMV)\u201d and that \u201c[f]uture mRNA vaccine technology may allow for one vaccine to provide protection against multiple diseases, thus decreasing the number of shots needed for protection against common vaccine-preventable diseases.\u201d The CDC also says that the goal is to take mRNA \u2018beyond vaccines,\u201d: for example, by using mRNA \u201cto trigger the immune system to target specific cancer cells. Readers, what do you think: is this insistent march toward future research warranted? How confidently do you feel that the potential safety concerns of these shots are being adequately investigated? Will these expanded applications of mRNA technology lead to unintended consequences for individual and public health \u2013 let alone societal freedoms and medical autonomy?

        "link":"https:\/\/www.naturalhealth365.com\/vax-scientist-sounds-alarm-demands-immediate-withdrawal-of-covid-injections.html",
        "text":"(NaturalHealth365) Are quadruple-jabbed older adults (quadruple-jabbed = the initial two-dose series of the COVID shot plus two booster doses) facing higher rates of death because of the gene-based drugs injected into their bodies? One vaccinologist believes so, at least in his home country of the Netherlands. Let\u2019s take a look at the official data he\u2019s citing to argue that these endless mRNA jabs are far more harmful than helpful for a significant number of individuals exposed to them. Experienced vaccinologist says post-jab deaths among older adults rising significantly in the Netherlands \u2013 could this become a global trend? Dr. Theo Schetters is a highly respected, accredited, internationally recognized vaccinologist, vax developer and researcher, and academic professor. Among his impressive accolades from his 40-year career, Dr. Schetters is the recipient of the Medal of Honour of the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Montpellier in France. In a recent interview on the De Nieuwe Wereld Podcast with host Marlies Dekkers and fellow vax expert Dr. Robert Malone, Dr. Schetters outlines some of his main concerns with the current COVID jabs, particularly for individuals older than 60. In the Netherlands, he says, official data from the country\u2019s Department of Health show that multiple doses of these shots (specifically, two primary doses plus two boosters) are increasing the rates of all-cause mortality among 60+-year-old individuals. In fact, he says, the data are now \u201cvery clear that there is a good correlation between the number of vaccinations that are given to people and the number of people that die within a week after that. So let\u2019s say this week we gave 10,000 vaccinations. Then this week, we have something like 125 [excess deaths] in that week.\u201d In other words, when more vaxxes are given in a week, there will be more excess deaths occurring in that same week, and vice versa (when fewer vaxxes are given in a week, there will be fewer excess deaths occurring in that same week). According to his \u201crough calculation,\u201d Dr. Schetters says, the data suggests \u201cone in 800\u201d doses of COVID shots result in death. He says he has urged the Netherlands public health officials to \u201creconsider vaccination strategy, because I think this is a real warning.\u201d How big of a pattern or trend do public officials need to see in the COVID shot data before sounding the alarm? In addition to concerning all-cause mortality trends, Dr. Schetter points out that it\u2019s becoming more and more difficult for doctors to tease out whether negative health outcomes among their patients are caused by the shots. Because the mRNA jab \u201cpotentially affects all organs,\u201d Dr. Schetter says medical providers are now seeing \u201call sorts of symptoms [among their vaxxed patients] that they do not know what it is.\u201d And \u201cbecause the adverse effects are so not just one single adverse effect, but can be anything,\u201d Dr. Schetter notes that it\u2019s difficult to pull apart the statistical significance. Understanding that correlation is not sufficient to prove causation, we ask: just how much correlation in the data do officials need before they acknowledge that something might be seriously wrong that warrants further investigation?
